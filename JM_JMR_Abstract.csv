"1","Path to Purpose? How Online Customer Journeys Differ for Hedonic Versus Utilitarian Purchases","Journal of Marketing",2020,"The authors examine consumers? information channel usage during the customer journey by employing a hedonic and utilitarian (H/U) perspective, an important categorization of consumption purpose. Taking a retailer-category viewpoint to measure the H/U characteristics of 20 product categories at 40 different retailers, this study combines large-scale secondary clickstream and primary survey data to offer actionable insights for retailers in a competitive landscape. The data reveal that, when making hedonic purchases (e.g., toys), consumers employ social media and on-site product pages as early as two weeks before the final purchase. By contrast, for utilitarian purchases (e.g., office supplies), consumers utilize third-party reviews up to two weeks before the final purchase and make relatively greater usage of search engines, deals, and competitors? product pages closer to the time of purchase. Importantly, channel usage is different for sessions in which no purchase is made, indicating that consumers? information channel choices vary significantly with the H/U characteristics of purchases. The article closes with an extensive discussion of the significant implications for managing customer touchpoints.","Text Mining",1
"2","Branding in a Hyperconnected World: Refocusing Theories and Rethinking Boundaries","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world, requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.","Text Mining",1
"3","Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words? An Empirical Study of Image Content and Social Media Engagement","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Are social media posts with pictures more popular than those without? Why do pictures with certain characteristics induce higher engagement than some other pictures? Using data sets of social media posts about major airlines and sport utility vehicle brands collected from Twitter and Instagram, the authors empirically examine the influence of image content on social media engagement. After accounting for selection bias on the inclusion of image content, the authors find a significant and robust positive mere presence effect of image content on user engagement in both product categories on Twitter. They also find that high-quality and professionally shot pictures consistently lead to higher engagement on both platforms for both product categories. However, the effect of colorfulness varies by product category, while the presence of human face and image?text fit can induce higher user engagement on Twitter but not on Instagram. These findings shed light on how to improve social media engagement using image content.","Text Mining",0
"4","Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing.

"7","Do Spoilers Really Spoil? Using Topic Modeling to Measure the Effect of Spoiler Reviews on Box Office Revenue","Journal of Marketing",2020,"A sizable portion of online movie reviews contain spoilers, defined as information that prematurely resolves plot uncertainty. In this research, the authors study the consequences of spoiler reviews using data on box office revenue and online word of mouth for movies released in the United States. To capture the degree of information in spoiler review text that reduces plot uncertainty, the authors propose a spoiler intensity metric and measure it using a correlated topic model. Using a dynamic panel model with movie fixed effects and instrumental variables, the authors find a significant and positive relationship between spoiler intensity and box office revenue with an elasticity of .06. The positive effect of spoiler intensity is greater for movies with a limited release, smaller advertising spending, and moderate user ratings, and is stronger in the earlier days after the movie?s release. Using an event study and online experiments, the authors provide further evidence that spoiler reviews can help consumers reduce their uncertainty about the quality of movies, consequently encouraging theater visits. Thus, movie studios may benefit from consumers? access to plot-intense reviews and should actively monitor the content of spoiler reviews to better forecast box office performance.","topic model",1
"8","Advertising Effectiveness for Multiple Retailer-Brands in a Multimedia and Multichannel Environment","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"An important aspect of multimedia advertising effectiveness that remains unexplored is a customer-level analysis of the relative importance of each medium for multiple retailer-brands within a product category. The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million) and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers. They segment customers by retailer-brand and channel usage, revealing a sizeable group of customers who shop across multiple retailer-brands and both purchase channels. Moreover, this segment is the most responsive to multimedia advertising.","topic model",0
"9","Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-Disclosure","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one?s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.","topic model",1
"10","Modeling Dynamic Heterogeneity Using Gaussian Processes","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand the rich heterogeneity of consumers, firms, and products. While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH?s rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.","topic model",0

"13","The Enhancing Versus Backfiring Effects of Positive Emotion in Consumer Reviews","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Researchers, marketers, and consumers often believe that amplifying emotional content is impactful for the spread of information and purchasing decisions. However, there is little systematic investigation of when emotionality backfires. This research demonstrates when and why positive emotion can have enhancing versus backfiring effects. The authors find that reviewers who express greater positive emotion are indeed more positive toward their products, regardless of product type. In addition, expressed emotion for hedonic products has a positive impact when read by others, but this emotion backfires for utilitarian products, leading others to be less positive. The authors construct a conceptual model of these effects and show that violated expectations leading to decreased trust underlie this divergence between reviewers and readers. The effects occur in well-controlled experiments as well as computational linguistic analysis of 100,000 Amazon reviews across 500 products. Indeed, emotional reviews of utilitarian products are less likely to become popular and be displayed on the product?s front page on Amazon. This work also introduces a novel tool for quantifying natural language in marketing: the Evaluative Lexicon.","computational linguistics",0

"17","Negative Reviews, Positive Impact: Consumer Empathetic Responding to Unfair Word of Mouth","Journal of Marketing",2020,"This research documents how negative reviews, when perceived as unfair, can activate feelings of empathy toward firms that have been wronged. Six studies and four supplemental experiments provide converging evidence that this experienced empathy for the firm motivates supportive consumer responses such as paying higher purchase prices and reporting increased patronage intentions. Importantly, this research highlights factors that can increase or decrease empathy toward a firm. For instance, adopting the reviewer?s perspective when evaluating an unfair negative review can reduce positive consumer responses to a firm, whereas conditions that enhance the ability to experience empathy?such as when reviews are highly unfair, when the identity of the employee is made salient, or when the firm responds in an empathetic manner?can result in positive consumer responses toward the firm. Overall, this work extends the understanding of consumers? responses to word of mouth in the marketplace by highlighting the role of perceived (un)fairness. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for better management of consumer reviews.","user-generated-content",1
"18","The Effect of Links and Excerpts on Internet News Consumption","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Internet news and search sites often excerpt content from and link to competing news outlets. On the one hand, providing outbound links can make the linking site more attractive, even to the point of stealing traffic from the linked sites. Regulatory policy, such as the European Union?s Copyright Directive Article 15 taxing links, is predicated in part on this idea. On the other hand, receiving inbound links can increase a linked site?s audience by informing readers about its news content that day. To explore these opposing perspectives, the authors develop a dynamic learning model and fit it to browsing and link data from celebrity news sites. They then simulate how banning links affects consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least. On average, linking benefits both the linking and linked sites. The authors estimate that exposure to a link increases the likelihood of visiting the linked site by .14%. This increase is approximately three times the commonly reported click-through rate for paid display advertisements.","user-generated-content",0

"20","The Strength of Weak-Tie Consensus Language","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Every day, consumers share word of mouth (WOM) on how products and behaviors are commonly adopted through the use of consensus language. Consensus language refers to words and expressions that suggest general agreement among a group of people regarding an opinion, product, or behavior (e.g., ?everyone likes this movie?). In a series of online and field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using consensus language. The authors theorize and demonstrate that this effect occurs because weak ties evoke perceptions of a larger and more diverse group in consensus, which signals greater validity for the issue at hand. These findings contribute to research on WOM, tie strength, and descriptive norms and provide practical implications for marketers on ways to analyze and encourage consumer discourse.","user-generated-content",0

"22","Improvised Marketing Interventions in Social Media","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Online virality has attracted the attention of academics and marketers who want to identify the characteristics of online content that promote sharing. This article adds to this body of research by examining the phenomenon of improvised marketing interventions (IMIs)?social media actions that are composed and executed in real time proximal to an external event. Using the concept of quick wit, and theorizing that the effect of IMIs is furthered by humor and timeliness or unanticipation, the authors find evidence of these effects on both virality and firm value across five multimethod studies, including quasiexperiments, experiments, and archival data analysis. These findings point to the potential of IMIs in social media and to the features that firms should proactively focus on managing in order to reap the observed online sharing and firm value benefits.","user-generated-content",1

"26","The Impact of Advertising and R&D on Bankruptcy Survival: A Double-Edged Sword","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm?s expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm?s assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm?s suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court?s decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%?38% (18%?21%) of the bankrupt firm?s debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm?s advertising and R&D.","machine learning",1
"27","Turning Complaining Customers into Loyal Customers: Moderators of the Complaint Handling?Customer Loyalty Relationship","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Firms spend substantial resources responding to customer complaints, and the marketing profession has a long history of supporting that enterprise to promote customer loyalty. The authors question whether this response is always warranted or whether its effectiveness instead depends on economic, industry, customer?firm, product/service, and customer segment factors that may alter the firm?s incentives to compete on complaint management. To consider this question, they integrate economic and marketing theories and investigate factors that influence the complaint recovery?customer loyalty relationship via a sample of 35,597 complaining customers spanning a ten-year period across economic sectors, industries, and firms. Overall, the authors find that the recovery?loyalty relationship is stronger in faster-growing economies, for industries with more competition, for luxury products, and for customers with higher satisfaction and higher expectations of customization. Conversely, the recovery?loyalty relationship is weaker when customers? expectations of product/service reliability are higher, for manufactured goods, and for men compared with women. The authors discuss implications of these results for managers, policy makers, and researchers for more effective management of customer complaints.","machine learning",1
"28","Contour-as-Face Framework: A Method to Preserve Privacy and Perception","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Consumers and marketers use facial information to make important inferences about others in many business contexts. However, consumers and firms are increasingly concerned about privacy and discrimination. To address privacy?perception trade-offs, the authors propose a novel contour-as-face (CaF) framework that transforms face images into contour images incorporating both the nonoutline and outline features of facial parts. In three empirical studies, the authors (1) compare human perceptions of face and contour images along 15 dimensions commonly assessed in marketing contexts; (2) investigate the effectiveness of contour images for protecting anonymity related to identity, age, and gender; and (3) implement the CaF framework in a real-life online dating context. Results show that the CaF framework effectively resolves privacy?perception trade-off problems by preserving the information that is useful for humans to make inferences about many relevant perceptual dimensions in marketing while making it virtually impossible for humans to infer identity and very difficult to infer age and gender accurately?two critical discrimination factors. Results from the field implementation demonstrate the feasibility and value of using the CaF framework for real-life decision making.","machine learning",0
"29","The Faces of Success: Beauty and Ugliness Premiums in e-Commerce Platforms","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Given the positive bias toward attractive people in society, online sellers are justifiably apprehensive about perceptions of their profile pictures. Although the existing literature emphasizes the ?beauty premium? and the ?ugliness penalty,? the current studies of seller profile pictures on customer-to-customer e-commerce platforms find a U-shaped relationship between facial attractiveness and product sales (i.e., both beauty and ugliness premiums and, thus, a ?plainness penalty?). By analyzing two large data sets, the authors find that both attractive and unattractive people sell significantly more than plain-looking people. Two online experiments reveal that attractive sellers enjoy greater source credibility due to perceived sociability and competence, whereas unattractive sellers are considered more believable on the basis of their perceived competence. While a beauty premium is apparent for appearance-relevant products, an ugliness premium is more pronounced for expertise-relevant products and for female consumers evaluating male sellers. These findings highlight the influence of facial appearance as a key vehicle for impression formation in online platforms and its complex effects in e-commerce and marketing.","machine learning",1

Despite this, the nature of marketing excellence and its effectiveness remain unclear. This research offers insight by addressing two questions: (1) How do managers understand and exercise marketing excellence? and (2) How do investors evaluate marketing excellence? Study 1 merges insights from 39 in-depth interviews with senior executives and secondary data from 150 firm strategies to find that marketing excellence is a strategy type focused on achieving organic growth by executing priorities related to the marketing ecosystem, end user, and marketing agility. Study 2 quantifies the impact of marketing excellence on firm value by using a machine learning algorithm and text analysis through an original dictionary to classify the text from 8,317 letters to shareholders in 1,727 U.S. firm annual reports. Calendar-time portfolio models reveal abnormal one-year returns of up to 8.58% for marketing excellence?returns that outpace those associated with market orientation and marketing capabilities.

"32","Advertising Effectiveness for Multiple Retailer-Brands in a Multimedia and Multichannel Environment","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"An important aspect of multimedia advertising effectiveness that remains unexplored is a customer-level analysis of the relative importance of each medium for multiple retailer-brands within a product category. The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million) and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers. They segment customers by retailer-brand and channel usage, revealing a sizeable group of customers who shop across multiple retailer-brands and both purchase channels. Moreover, this segment is the most responsive to multimedia advertising.","machine learning",0
"33","Improving Cancer Outreach Effectiveness Through Targeting and Economic Assessments: Insights from a Randomized Field Experiment","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10?20 (13?24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients? demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%?96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.","machine learning",1
"34","Business-to-Business E-Negotiations and Influence Tactics","Journal of Marketing",2020,"E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates salespeople?s use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers? attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople?s influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers? attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.","machine learning",1
"35","Creating Boundary-Breaking, Marketing-Relevant Consumer Research","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Consumer research often fails to have broad impact on members of the marketing discipline, on adjacent disciplines studying related phenomena, and on relevant stakeholders who stand to benefit from the knowledge created by rigorous research. The authors propose that impact is limited because consumer researchers have adhered to a set of implicit boundaries or defaults regarding what consumer researchers study, why they study it, and how they do so. The authors identify these boundaries and describe how they can be challenged. By detailing five impactful articles and identifying others, they show that boundary-breaking, marketing-relevant consumer research can influence relevant stakeholders including academics in marketing and allied disciplines as well as a wide range of marketplace actors (e.g., business practitioners, policy makers, the media, society). Drawing on these articles, the authors articulate what researchers can do to break boundaries and enhance the impact of their research. They also indicate why engaging in boundary-breaking work and enhancing the breadth of marketing?s influence is good for both individual researchers and the fields of consumer research and marketing.","machine learning",1
"36","Modeling Dynamic Heterogeneity Using Gaussian Processes","Journal of Marketing Research",2020,"Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand the rich heterogeneity of consumers, firms, and products. While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH?s rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.","machine learning",0

"39","Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-Disclosure","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one?s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.","natural language processing",1

How Online Customer Journeys Differ for Hedonic Versus Utilitarian Purchases","Journal of Marketing",2020,"The authors examine consumers? information channel usage during the customer journey by employing a hedonic and utilitarian (H/U) perspective, an important categorization of consumption purpose. Taking a retailer-category viewpoint to measure the H/U characteristics of 20 product categories at 40 different retailers, this study combines large-scale secondary clickstream and primary survey data to offer actionable insights for retailers in a competitive landscape. The data reveal that, when making hedonic purchases (e.g., toys), consumers employ social media and on-site product pages as early as two weeks before the final purchase. By contrast, for utilitarian purchases (e.g., office supplies), consumers utilize third-party reviews up to two weeks before the final purchase and make relatively greater usage of search engines, deals, and competitors? product pages closer to the time of purchase. Importantly, channel usage is different for sessions in which no purchase is made, indicating that consumers? information channel choices vary significantly with the H/U characteristics of purchases.

Employing the Marketing Mix to Alleviate Experiences of Donor Sacrifice","Journal of Marketing",2020,"Nonprofit organizations often rely on individuals to execute their mission of addressing unmet societal needs. Indeed, one of the most significant challenges facing such organizations is that of enlisting individuals to provide support through the volunteering of time or donation of money. To address this challenge, prior studies have examined how promotional messages can be leveraged to motivate individuals to support the missions of nonprofit organizations. Yet promotional messages are only one aspect of the marketing mix that may be employed. The present study examines how donor-based nonprofit organizations can employ the marketing mix?product, price, promotion, place, process, and people?to influence the experiences of sacrifice associated with donation. The authors do so through an ethnographic study of individuals participating in living organ donation. First, they identify the manifestation of sacrifice in donation. Next, they define three complementary and interactive types of sacrifice: psychic, pecuniary, and physical. Then, they articulate how the marketing mix can be employed to mitigate experiences of sacrifice that emerge through the donation process. The authors conclude by discussing implications for marketing practice and identifying additional research opportunities for sacrifice in the realm of donation.","marketing insight",1

On the other hand, receiving inbound links can increase a linked site?s audience by informing readers about its news content that day. To explore these opposing perspectives, the authors develop a dynamic learning model and fit it to browsing and link data from celebrity news sites. They then simulate how banning links affects consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least. On average, linking benefits both the linking and linked sites. The authors estimate that exposure to a link increases the likelihood of visiting the linked site by .14%.

Four experiments using contexts of mental health, skin cancer, and breast cancer show that illness detection evokes fear, which undermines engagement in detection behaviors. Considering detection at low (vs. high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion. Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as serving illness-prevention goals increased people?s likelihood of engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have divergent effects on health persuasion.","sentiment analysis",0

This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower?s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.","Text Mining",0

The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning?based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers? review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","Text Mining",0

In practice, some UGC sites indicate if a review was posted from a mobile device. For example, TripAdvisor uses a ?via mobile? label to denote reviews from mobile devices. However, the extent to which such information affects consumers is unknown. To address this gap, the authors use TripAdvisor data and five experiments to examine how mobile devices influence consumers? perceptions of online reviews and their purchase intentions. They find that knowing a review was posted from a mobile device can lead consumers to have higher purchase intentions. Interestingly, this is due to a process in which consumers assume mobile reviews are more physically effortful to craft and subsequently equate this greater perceived effort with the credibility of the review.","Text Mining",0

"63","Detecting, Preventing, and Mitigating Online Firestorms in Brand Communities","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Online firestorms pose severe threats to online brand communities. Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high- and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm?s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.","Text Mining",1

Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people?s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the ?character strengths? taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering.

Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","NLP",0
"66","The Relative Effects of Business-to-Business (vs. Business-to-Consumer) Service Innovations on Firm Value and Firm Risk: An Empirical Analysis","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs? effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers.

Using mixed methods, the authors demonstrate a crossover effect in which a ?mismatch? of the fundamental motivations behind authentic creation narratives and traditional persuasive messages enhances adoption of the cocreated innovation. This effect is mediated by potential adopters? self-referencing of their own stories about similar experiences or consumption episodes. Furthermore, the effect of a motivation mismatch strategy is attenuated for expert consumers. Finally, this motivation mismatch strategy triggers ?takeoff? of cocreated innovations. This research offers substantial implications for research on cocreated innovation, narrative persuasion, and firm-generated and user-generated communication.

Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower?s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.","computational linguistics",0

This research examines the role of divergent opinions, rater experience, and firm product portfolio in attenuating/amplifying herding influences in online rating environments. Applying robust econometric techniques on data from a community of board gamers, we find that herding effects are significant and recommend a more nuanced view of herding. Highlighting the role of rater experience, the positive influence of the crowd is weakened and friend influences are amplified as the rater gains experience. Furthermore, divergent opinions between reference groups create herding and differentiation depending on the reference group and the rater?s experience level. Finally, firms can influence online opinion through their product portfolio in profound ways.

By analyzing a unique data set of shareholder complaints submitted to S&P 1500 firms between 2001 and 2016, supplemented with qualitative interviews of executives of publicly listed firms, the authors document that firms increase advertising investments following shareholder complaints and that such an advertising investment response mitigates a postcomplaint decline in firm value. Furthermore, results suggest that firms are more likely to increase advertising investments when shareholder complaints are submitted by institutional investors, pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and relate to topics that receive high media attention.

The authors use data from a worldwide leading music platform to study unknown music creators who aim to increase exposure of their content by expanding their follower base through directing outbound activities to other users. The authors find that the responsiveness of seeding targets strongly declines with status difference; thus, unknown music creators (the majority) do not generally benefit at all from seeding influencers. Instead, they should gradually build their status by targeting low-status users rather than attempt to ?jump? by targeting high-status ones. This research extends the seeding literature by introducing the concept of risk to dissemination dynamics in online communications, showing that unknown music creators do not seed specific status levels but rather choose a portfolio of seeding targets while solving a risk versus return trade-off.

This study is among the first to examine native ads and unveil how their effectiveness changes across serial positions by analyzing a large-scale data set with 120 ads. For each ad, the authors use separate ?natural experiment? studies to compare the ad?s performance as its serial position varies. Subsequently, they conduct a meta-analysis to generalize the results across all studies. The results reveal vastly asymmetric effects of native ad serial position on publishers? metrics (click-based) versus advertisers? metrics (conversion-based). As serial position lowers (i.e., from rank 1 to a lower rank), there are only modest changes in publishers? metrics, but drastic reductions in advertisers?. This pattern is unique to native ads and has not been indicated by prior research on ad serial position. Moreover, the authors show the moderating effects of audience gender and age.

"90","Paywalls: Monetizing Online Content","Journal of Marketing",2019,"In recent years, many news providers have begun monetizing online content through paywalls. While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation. The authors document the sizes of the two externalities for the New York Times paywall and compare them with the direct subscription revenue generated. They comment on implications for newspapers and online content providers that are seeking mechanisms to monetize digital content.","user-generated-content",1

"92","Large-Scale Cross-Category Analysis of Consumer Review Content on Sales Conversion Leveraging Deep Learning","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"How consumers use review content has remained opaque due to the unstructured nature of text and the lack of review-reading behavior data. The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning?based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers? review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","machine learning",0
"93","When Words Sweat: Identifying Signals for Loan Default in the Text of Loan Applications","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"The authors present empirical evidence that borrowers, consciously or not, leave traces of their intentions, circumstances, and personality traits in the text they write when applying for a loan. This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower?s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.","machine learning",0
"94","A Tale of Two Twitterspheres: Political Microblogging During and After the 2016 Primary and Presidential Debates","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"In this research, the authors study the process by which social media posts are created and shared during live political debates. Using data from over 9.5 million tweets posted during and shortly after four key debates leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the authors test a series of hypotheses about how tweeting evolves over time during such events. They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the ?Twittersphere? became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event. Evidence for the generalizability of the findings is provided by an analysis of Barack Obama?s last State of the Union Address, where similar dynamics are observed.","machine learning",0

Many firms track buyers? offline interactions, design online content to coincide with customers? experiences, and face varied performance during events, enabling the modification of marketer-generated content to correspond to the event outcomes. This study examines the role of firms? social media engagement initiatives surrounding customers? experiential interaction events in influencing the sentiment of customers? digital engagement. Results indicate that marketers can influence the sentiment of customers? digital engagement beyond their performance during customers? interactions, and for unfavorable event outcomes, informational marketer-generated content, more so than emotional content, can enhance customer sentiment. This study also highlights sentiment?s role as a leading indicator for customer lifetime value.","machine learning",1
"96","The Relative Effects of Business-to-Business (vs. Business-to-Consumer) Service Innovations on Firm Value and Firm Risk: An Empirical Analysis","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs? effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.","machine learning",1
"97","The Unintended Consequence of Price-Based Service Recovery Incentives","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Subscription-based service providers (e.g., newspapers, internet services) often issue price-based incentives to recover from service failures. However, because considerable time may pass between when providers issue a recovery incentive and when service contracts are due for renewal, it is unclear whether recovery incentives can improve customer retention in the long run. The authors investigate this question by examining 6,919 contract renewal decisions of newspaper subscribers who received varying levels of recovery incentives after newspaper delivery failures. In contrast to conventional wisdom, they find that recovery incentives are associated with lower contract renewal likelihoods. They rationalize this finding using the economic theory of reference prices and further demonstrate that firms could mitigate the unintended consequence of recovery incentives by reminding subscribers of the original price at touch points following the recovery, discounting the renewal price, and prolonging the duration between the recovery and renewal. The authors also show that the intensity of promotions in the external environment at the time of administering recovery incentives, and that acquiring subscribers by communicating the value of the subscription service, can influence the long-term effectiveness of recovery incentives. For subscription-based service providers, the authors propose a decision support model to optimize recovery and renewal incentives and demonstrate its utility within this empirical context.","machine learning",1

It also examines the sharing economy?s impact on marketing?s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy?s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.","machine learning",1

Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships.

"100","Immediate Responses of Online Brand Search and Price Search to TV Ads","Journal of Marketing",2019,"This study aims to deepen the understanding of evaluating TV ad spots by their immediate effects on important online activities. The authors merged minute-by-minute brand search and price search data with spot-level TV advertisement data for the three leading pickup truck brands in the United States over an 11-month period. They presented a generalizable modeling framework and used it to estimate the size and variation of immediate online responses to TV ads. The average elasticity of brand search to a brand?s own national ads is .09, and the average elasticity of price search to a brand?s own national ads is .03. Given ad audience size, immediate search responses vary with ad creative characteristics, audience category interest, slot of the break, program genre, and time factors. Overall, the results show that ordinary TV ads lead to a variety of immediate online responses and that advertisers can use these signals to enrich their media planning and campaign evaluations.","machine learning",1
"101","Targeted Promotions on an E-Book Platform: Crowding Out, Heterogeneity, and Opportunity Costs","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"Targeted promotions based on individual purchase history can increase sales. However, the opportunity costs of targeting to optimize promoted product sales are poorly understood. A series of randomized field experiments with a large e-book platform shows that although targeted promotions increase promoted product sales and purchases of similar products, they can crowd out purchases of dissimilar products (i.e., e-books from nontargeted genres) by decreasing search activities of nontargeted goods on the same platform. The effects on total sales are heterogeneous, ranging from net decreases to insignificant drops, motivating a targeting exercise comparing strategies that optimize promoted product sales versus total sales. Targeting for promoted product sales tends to assign promotions to customers who purchased similar products, whereas targeting for total sales assigns promotions on the basis of other user characteristics. Targeting for promoted product sales generated incremental total sales that amounted to approximately 29% of the optimal incremental total sales when targeting for total sales (an opportunity cost of 71%). The optimal targeting exercise highlights how maximizing promotional lift can incur opportunity costs in terms of other forgone sales.","machine learning",0

Increasingly, this content is generated on smartphones rather than personal computers (PCs). This article argues that because of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies?two field studies and three controlled experiments?the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect?especially positive affect?relative to PC-generated content. The findings also show that differences in emotional content are driven by the tendency to generate briefer content on smartphones rather than user self-selection, differences in topical content, or timing of writing.

"103","Extracting Features of Entertainment Products: A Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation Approach Informed by the Psychology of Media Consumption","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"The authors propose a quantitative approach for describing entertainment products, in a way that allows for improving the predictive performance of consumer choice models for these products. Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people?s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the ?character strengths? taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering.

Measuring Potential Negative Consequences of Online Ad Volume and Placement on Website Visits","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"The global importance of online advertising calls for a detailed understanding of consumer-specific responses to online ad repetitions. A key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display degrees of ?wearout? but also whether they can surpass a point at which additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: ?weariness.? The authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model?s main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users? ad response. Analysis further suggests that an appropriate ?profiling and capping? strategy can improve ad deployment by as much as 15% overall for these data.","machine learning",0

Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high- and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm?s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.","natural language processing",1

In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products? tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product?s past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products? biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.","marketing insight",1

Therefore, the authors combine insights from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and, correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect suppliers? competitiveness.","marketing insight",1

"117","Opportunity Cost Overestimation","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"Consumers often fail to utilize desirable offers they had originally selected and planned to use and thus later regret missing out on them. This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to choose arises from external rather than internal constraints, opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time, budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal when that trade-off is ?built-in? (e.g., when a marketing incentive requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate opportunity cost overestimation.","interdisciplinary",0

The authors build and investigate a theoretical model that highlights two unique characteristics of free products (reciprocity motivation and diminished adoption risk) and considers their implications for WOM sharing. Results of a retrospective survey, two controlled experiments, and an analysis of more than 5,000 mobile apps at Google Play and Apple?s App Store reveal that consumers are generally more likely to share their opinions of free products than paid products, because of feelings of reciprocity toward the producer. However, this difference is reduced when prior consumer WOM is low in volume and highly disperse, signaling greater adoption risk.

"120","The Sleepy Consumer and Variety Seeking","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"Sleepiness, the subjective feeling of the propensity to fall asleep, is a common, everyday experience that can be induced by various factors, such as sleep quality, sleep deprivation, ingestion of certain substances, or belief about how much sleep a person needs. Despite its prevalence, sleepiness and its influence on consumption behavior have rarely been linked in the research to date. The present research helps fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer variety-seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness. The effect of sleepiness on variety seeking uncovered in this research is somewhat nonintuitive, in the sense that, a priori, one might expect sleepiness to be more likely to decrease rather than increase exploratory behavior. The authors discuss implications of the findings for different research areas and for marketing practice.","interdisciplinary",0

They combine advertising and sales promotion data from FMCG brand managers with sales and retail variables from market research companies as well as firm-created word-of-mouth variables from SMC agencies. The authors analyze the data using several approaches, confronting challenges of endogeneity and multicollinearity. They consistently find that firm-created word of mouth through SMC programs interacts negatively with all tested forms of advertising but positively with promotional activities. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding the utility of SMCs and how they should be managed. The analysis implies that SMCs may increase total sales by approximately 3%?18% throughout the campaigns.","interdisciplinary",1
"122","Does It Pay to Be Real? Understanding Authenticity in TV Advertising","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Marketing managers and creatives alike believe that authenticity is an essential element for effective advertising. However, no common understanding of authenticity in advertising exists, and empirical knowledge about its impact on consumer behavior is limited. In this study, the authors use a comprehensive literature review and qualitative studies to identify four dimensions of authenticity in an advertising context. By examining 323 television ads across 67 brands and four years, they investigate these dimensions? effects on the sales performance of advertised products. Because the impact of authenticity may depend on brand or product characteristics, the authors also analyze how these effects vary with brand size or across hedonic and utilitarian products. The results suggest that authenticity influences consumer behavior in a more nuanced manner than previously recognized. For instance, whereas an ad congruent with the brand?s essence has a positive effect on sales in most cases, an overly honest advertising message can actually hurt performance; the latter is true especially for hedonic products, for which consumers rely more on subjective information when making purchase decisions.","interdisciplinary",1
"123","Large-Scale Cross-Category Analysis of Consumer Review Content on Sales Conversion Leveraging Deep Learning","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"How consumers use review content has remained opaque due to the unstructured nature of text and the lack of review-reading behavior data. The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning?based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers? review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","sentiment analysis",0
"124","A Tale of Two Twitterspheres: Political Microblogging During and After the 2016 Primary and Presidential Debates","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"In this research, the authors study the process by which social media posts are created and shared during live political debates. Using data from over 9.5 million tweets posted during and shortly after four key debates leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the authors test a series of hypotheses about how tweeting evolves over time during such events. They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the ?Twittersphere? became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event. Evidence for the generalizability of the findings is provided by an analysis of Barack Obama?s last State of the Union Address, where similar dynamics are observed.","sentiment analysis",0
"125","The Relative Effects of Business-to-Business (vs. Business-to-Consumer) Service Innovations on Firm Value and Firm Risk: An Empirical Analysis","Journal of Marketing",2019,"Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs? effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.","sentiment analysis",1
"126","Selectively Emotional: How Smartphone Use Changes User-Generated Content","Journal of Marketing Research",2019,"User-generated content has become ubiquitous and very influential in the marketplace. Increasingly, this content is generated on smartphones rather than personal computers (PCs). This article argues that because of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies?two field studies and three controlled experiments?the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect?especially positive affect?relative to PC-generated content. The findings also show that differences in emotional content are driven by the tendency to generate briefer content on smartphones rather than user self-selection, differences in topical content, or timing of writing. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","sentiment analysis",0

"129","Online Reputation Mechanisms and the Decreasing Value of Chain Affiliation","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"This article investigates the value of business format franchising and how it is changing in response to a large increase in consumer information provided by online reputation mechanisms. Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms? ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews.

This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.","user-generated-content",1

The authors study the impact of network overlap?the overlap in network connections between two users?on content sharing in directed social media platforms. The authors propose a hazards model that flexibly captures the impact of three measures of network overlap (i.e., common followees, common followers, and common mutual followers) on content sharing. Using data on content sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many others have already shared it. Collectively, these results have a bearing for marketers to more effectively target users for spreading content on social media platforms.","user-generated-content",0

To this end, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model and accessibility/diagnosticity perspective, the authors hypothesize varying effects of owned and earned social media (OSM and ESM) on brand awareness, purchase intent, and customer satisfaction and link these consumer mindset metrics to shareholder value (abnormal returns and idiosyncratic risk). Analyzing daily data for 45 brands in 21 sectors using vector autoregression models, they find that brand fan following improves all three mindset metrics. ESM engagement volume affects brand awareness and purchase intent but not customer satisfaction, while ESM positive and negative valence have the largest effects on customer satisfaction. OSM increases brand awareness and customer satisfaction but not purchase intent, highlighting a nonlinear effect of OSM. Interestingly, OSM is more likely to increase purchase intent for high involvement utilitarian brands and for brands with higher reputation, implying that running a socially responsible business lends more credibility to OSM. Finally, purchase intent and customer satisfaction positively affect shareholder value.","user-generated-content",1

"142","Efficient Large-Scale Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"In today's digital market, the number of websites available for advertising has ballooned into the millions. Consequently, firms often turn to ad agencies and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to decide how to allocate their Internet display advertising budgets. Nevertheless, most extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally, this method can accommodate several practical considerations including consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media coverage to matched content websites.","machine learning",0

One can think of the Apple Watch NikePlus (AWNP) offering in which the consumer co-creates valuable experienced outcomes with a mix of applications, touchpoints, and uses, while AWNP and its organizing actors co-create environments with consumers. Actors increasingly find themselves in such a joint enactment of interactional value creation, through offerings as evolving digitalized networked arrangements of artifacts, persons, processes, and interfaces, which the authors refer to as a Digitalized Interactive Platform (DIP). This implies a broader view of value creation?one in which value is created through interactions, versus one where value is simply the exchange of a fixed offering between a firm and its customers.

Using outsourced regulation theory, the authors predict negative moderating effects of frontline relational work and displayed affect on the dynamic influence of frontline solving work on CSAT. Frontline employees' verbal (nonverbal) cues provide the basis to identify solving and relational work (displayed affect). The authors test hypotheses with data from video recordings of real-life problem-solving interactions involving airline customers as well as a controlled experimental study. They find that frontline solving work has a positive effect on CSAT, and it increases in magnitude as the interaction unfolds. However, this positive effect becomes weaker for relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time. In summary, overdoing relational work and overdisplaying positive affect diminish the efficacy of problem-solving interactions, a finding that provides implications for theory and practice.","machine learning",0

Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.","machine learning",0
"151","Talk Bursts: The Role of Spikes in Prerelease Word-of-Mouth Dynamics","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"Before their launch, many new products generate word of mouth (WOM) on social media. Such WOM typically increases toward the release date and contains sudden spikes. These spikes capture manifestations of peak consumer attention and are therefore of managerial importance, yet they have not received research attention. This article is the first to provide a comprehensive descriptive treatment of WOM spikes. The authors propose a conceptual framework to present spikes as a standalone WOM dimension and explain their emergence. They employ a robust filtering procedure to detect spikes and apply it in a data set of 90,000 prerelease online WOM messages on 157 Hollywood movies. The results indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details than is WOM outside spikes. Prerelease WOM spikes also contribute significantly to the predictability of future product sales.","natural language processing",0
"152","Strategic Information Transmission in Peer-to-Peer Lending Markets","Journal of Marketing",2018,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, such as Uber, Airbnb, and Lending Club, have experienced massive growth in recent years. They now constitute a significant portion of the world's economy and provide opportunities for people to transact directly with one another. However, such growth also challenges participants to cope with information asymmetry about the quality of the offerings in the marketplace. By conducting an analysis of a P2P lending market, the authors propose and test a theory in which countersignaling provides a mechanism to attenuate information asymmetry about financial products (loans) offered on the platform. Data from a P2P lending website reveal significant, nonmonotonic relationships among the transmission of nonverifiable information, loan funding, and ex post loan quality, consistent with the proposed theory. The results provide insights for platform owners who seek to manage the level of information asymmetry in their P2P environments to create more balanced marketplaces, as well as for P2P participants interested in improving their ability to process information about the goods and services they seek to transact online.","natural language processing",1
"153","Neural Profiling of Brands: Mapping Brand Image in Consumers? Brains with Visual Templates","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"The authors demonstrate a novel template-based approach to profiling brand image using functional magnetic resonance imaging. They compare consumers? brain responses during passive viewing of visual templates (photos depicting various social scenarios) and brain responses during active visualizing of a brand's image, and then they generate individual neural profiles of brand image that correlate with the participant's own self-report perception of those consumer brands. In aggregate, these neural profiles of brand image are associated with perceived cobranding suitability and reflect brand image strength rated by a separate and bigger sample of consumers. This neural profiling approach offers a customizable tool for inspecting and comparing brand-specific mental associations, both across brands and across consumers. It also demonstrates the potential of using pattern analysis of neuroimaging data to study multisensory, nonverbal consumer knowledge and experience.","marketing insight",0
"154","When Does Market Share Matter? New Empirical Generalizations from a Meta-Analysis of the Market Share?Performance Relationship","Journal of Marketing",2018,"The impact of market share on financial firm performance is one of the most widely studied relationships in marketing strategy research. However, since the meta-analysis by Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and Varadarajan (1993), substantial environmental (e.g., digitization) and methodological (e.g., accounting for endogeneity) developments have occurred. The current work presents an updated and extended meta-analysis based on all available 863 elasticities drawn from 89 studies and provides the following new empirical generalizations: (1) The average raw market share?financial performance elasticity is .132, which is substantially lower than the effectiveness of other intermediate marketing metrics. This result challenges a widely used strategy that solely focuses on increasing market share. (2) Elasticities differ significantly between contextual settings. For example, they are lower for business-to-business firms than for business-to-consumer firms, for service firms than for manufacturing firms, and for U.S. markets than for emerging and Western European markets. The authors also observe differences between countries with respect to a general time trend (e.g., lower elasticities in recent times for Western European markets) and recessionary periods (e.g., lower elasticities in the United States, higher elasticities in non-Western economies).","interdisciplinary",1
"155","The Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on the Sales Force","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"This research draws from the psychodynamic perspective of social identity theory to examine the causal effect of mergers and acquisitions involving a mismatch of external images on the sales force. Study 1, a natural longitudinal experiment, shows that a merger with a poorer-image firm immediately dilutes salespeople's organizational identification (OI), which in turn impairs their performance. As sense makers, salespeople who are more tenured experience stronger OI dilution, whereas those who perceive a high level of social inclusion experience weaker OI dilution. As sense givers, managers who emphasize the firm's strategic intent in their communication buffer the OI-dilution effect, whereas those who emphasize the firm's organizational culture aggravate the effect. Study 2, a scenario-based experiment, further demonstrates that the OI-dilution effect is stronger than the OI-enhancement effect from merging with a better-image firm. Furthermore, both studies confirm that the adverse effect of mergers and acquisitions that involve a mismatch of external image stems from image uncertainty rather than job uncertainty.","interdisciplinary",0

"157","App Popularity: Where in the World are Consumers Most Sensitive to Price and User Ratings?","Journal of Marketing",2018,"Many companies compete globally in a world in which user ratings and price are important drivers of performance but whose importance may differ by country. This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.","sentiment analysis",1
"158","(I'm) Happy to Help (You): The Impact of Personal Pronoun Use in Customer?Firm Interactions","Journal of Marketing Research",2018,"In responding to customer questions or complaints, should marketing agents linguistically ?put the customer first? by using certain personal pronouns? Customer orientation theory, managerial literature, and surveys of managers, customer service representatives, and consumers suggest that firm agents should emphasize how ?we? (the firm) serve ?you? (the customer), while de-emphasizing ?I? (the agent) in these customer?firm interactions. The authors find evidence of this language pattern in use at over 40 firms. However, they theorize and demonstrate that these personal pronoun emphases are often suboptimal. Five studies using lab experiments and field data reveal that firm agents who refer to themselves using ?I? rather than ?we? pronouns increase customers? perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. In turn, these positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior. Furthermore, the authors find that customer-referencing ?you? pronouns have little impact on these outcomes and can sometimes have negative consequences. These findings enhance understanding of how, when, and why language use affects social perception and behavior and provide valuable insights for marketers.","sentiment analysis",0
"159","Improving Consumer Mindset Metrics and Shareholder Value through Social Media: The Different Roles of Owned and Earned Media","Journal of Marketing",2018,"Although research has examined the social media?shareholder value link, the role of consumer mindset metrics in this relationship remains unexplored. To this end, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model and accessibility/diagnosticity perspective, the authors hypothesize varying effects of owned and earned social media (OSM and ESM) on brand awareness, purchase intent, and customer satisfaction and link these consumer mindset metrics to shareholder value (abnormal returns and idiosyncratic risk). Analyzing daily data for 45 brands in 21 sectors using vector autoregression models, they find that brand fan following improves all three mindset metrics. ESM engagement volume affects brand awareness and purchase intent but not customer satisfaction, while ESM positive and negative valence have the largest effects on customer satisfaction. OSM increases brand awareness and customer satisfaction but not purchase intent, highlighting a nonlinear effect of OSM. Interestingly, OSM is more likely to increase purchase intent for high involvement utilitarian brands and for brands with higher reputation, implying that running a socially responsible business lends more credibility to OSM. Finally, purchase intent and customer satisfaction positively affect shareholder value.","sentiment analysis",1

"163","Online Relationship Formation","Journal of Marketing",2017,"As online shopping evolves from being primarily transactional to being more relational, sellers aim to form online relationships. This article investigates online relationship formation, identifies the performance payoffs that result from forming different types of online relationships (unilateral vs. reciprocal), and tests the most effective relationship-building strategies. Study 1, based on a longitudinal buyer-level analysis of an online shopping community, reveals that buyers use community-, seller-, and buyer-generated signals to identify suitable relationship partners and reduce online shopping risk. These signals generally diminish in importance as buyers gain experience but become more important when buyers are forming reciprocal relationships. Study 2 evaluates the dynamic payoffs of online relationship formation (seller-level analysis) on sales; the effect on sales of reciprocal relationships is three times greater and lasts seven times longer than that of seller-initiated, unilateral relationships. Study 3 is a field experiment testing managerially actionable strategies for leveraging relationships to grow online sales. Tenets arising from differences between online and offline relationships, together with the results from the three studies, inform an emerging theory of online relationships.","Text Mining",1

"167","Positioning Multicountry Brands: The Impact of Variation in Cultural Values and Competitive Set","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Building on cultural values research, the authors identify specific image attributes on which multicountry brands should position themselves consistently across markets. Leveraging prior research, they identify three life values that are most equal (benevolence, universalism, and self-direction) and two that are least equal (power and hedonism) in cross-national importance. The authors link specific brand image attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired worldwide. They also find that the attitudinal impact of a multicountry brand's positioning consistency on commonly valued image attributes is greater when the set of competitors the brand faces across its markets is more homogeneous. The authors discuss implications for global brand management theory and practice.","computational linguistics",0

"169","Online Shopping and Social Media: Friends or Foes?","Journal of Marketing",2017,"As social network use continues to increase, an important question for marketers is whether consumers? online shopping activities are related to their use of social networks and, if so, what the nature of this relationship is. On the one hand, spending time on social networks could facilitate social discovery, meaning that consumers ?discover? or ?stumble upon? products through their connections with others. Moreover, cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, social network use could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between social network use and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people's browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year. The authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity. However, they also find a short-term negative relationship, such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites, online shopping activity appears to be lower.","user-generated-content",1

Using two large-scale data sets with more than 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Studies 1 and 2 show consistently nonlinear effects. Although some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too many of them have a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques addressing self-selection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. In addition, novices can benefit more from greater social connections and interactions, yet also suffer more from the diminishing effects. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 shows that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too many of them can introduce an information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.","user-generated-content",1
"171","Crisis Management Strategies and the Long-Term Effects of Product Recalls on Firm Value","Journal of Marketing",2017,"Companies increasingly face product harm crises resulting in product recalls, which often have a negative impact on firm value. Whereas prior research has studied the short-term effects of product recalls on firm value, the authors of this article focus on the long-term effects. They develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses about the main effect of recall volume and the moderating effects of crisis management strategies on the relationship between recall volume and long-term firm value. They empirically test the hypotheses in the auto industry context using both short-term abnormal returns analysis and long-term calendar-time portfolio analysis of 280 product recalls during 2005?2015. The findings reveal that the negative impact of product recall volume lingers over time. Brand (promotion) advertising has a significant positive (negative) effect on the relationship between recall volume and long-term abnormal returns. Furthermore, both voluntary recall initiation and postrecall remedial efforts positively moderate the impact of recall volume on long-term returns. These moderating effects are contrary to those in the short term. The results suggest that managers should use different advertising types during and after a recall, strategically initiate recalls, and diligently prepare postrecall remedies to mitigate the negative effects of recall volume on long-term return.","user-generated-content",1
"172","Effects of Traditional Advertising and Social Messages on Brand-Building Metrics and Customer Acquisition","Journal of Marketing",2017,"This study examines the relative effectiveness of traditional advertising, impressions generated through firm-to-consumer (F2C) messages on Facebook, and the volume and valence of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) messages on Twitter and web forums for brand-building and customer acquisition efforts. The authors apply vector autoregressive modeling to a unique data set from a European telecom firm. This modeling approach allows them to consider the interrelations among traditional advertising, F2C impressions, and volume and valence of C2C social messages. The results show that traditional advertising is most effective for both brand building and customer acquisition. Impressions generated through F2C social messages complement traditional advertising efforts. Thus, thoroughly orchestrating traditional advertising and a firm's social media activities may improve a firm's performance with respect to building the brand and encouraging customer acquisition. Moreover, firms can stimulate the volume and valence of C2C messages through traditional advertising that in turn influences brand building and acquisition. These findings can help managers leverage the different types of messages more adequately.","user-generated-content",1

A Facebook Page Field Experiment","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Despite the tremendous resources devoted to marketing on Facebook, little is known about its actual effect on customers. Specifically, can Facebook page likes affect offline customer behavior, and if so, how? To answer these questions, the authors conduct a field experiment on acquired Facebook page likes and find them to have a positive causal effect on offline customer behavior. Importantly, these likes are found to be most effective when the Facebook page is used as a platform for firm-initiated promotional communications. No effect of acquired page likes is found when customers interact organically with the firm's page, but a significant effect is found when the firm pays to boost its page posts and thus uses its Facebook page as a platform for paid advertising. These results demonstrate the value of likes beyond Facebook activity itself and highlight the conditions under which acquiring likes is most valuable for firms.","user-generated-content",0
"175","Identifying the Presence and Cause of Fashion Cycles in Data","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Fashions and conspicuous consumption play an important role in marketing. In this article, the author presents a three-pronged framework to analyze fashion cycles in data composed of (1) algorithmic methods for identifying cycles, (2) a statistical framework for identifying cycles, and (3) methods for examining the drivers of such cycles. In the first module, the author identifies cycles by pattern-matching the amplitude and length of cycles observed to a user-specified definition. In the second module, the author defines the conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third, the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the different theories of fashion. The author applies her framework to data on given names for infants, shows the presence of large-amplitude cycles both algorithmically and statistically, and confirms that the adoption patterns are consistent with Bourdieu's theory of fashion as a signal of cultural capital.","user-generated-content",0

The authors develop a methodology they call ?ghost ads,? which facilitates this comparison by identifying the control group counterparts of the exposed consumers in a randomized experiment. The authors show that, relative to public service announcement and intent-to-treat A/B tests, ghost ads can reduce the cost of experimentation, improve measurement precision, deliver the relevant strategic baseline, and work with modern ad platforms that optimize ad delivery in real time. The authors also describe a variant, ?predicted ghost ad? methodology, which is compatible with online display advertising platforms; their implementation records more than 100 million predicted ghost ads per day. The authors demonstrate the methodology with an online retailer's display retargeting campaign. They show novel evidence that retargeting can work: the ads lifted website visits by 17.2% and purchases by 10.5%. Compared with intent-to-treat and public service announcement experiments, advertisers can measure ad lift just as precisely while spending at least an order of magnitude less.","machine learning",0

The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network?level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.","machine learning",0

To support this theory, the authors study mobile advertising response in a panel of 217 subscribers. The data set spans three months during which participants were sent mobile coupons from retailers in various product categories through a smartphone application. The data contain coupon conversions, demographic and psychographic information, and information on the hourly GPS location of participants and on their social ties in the form of referrals. The authors find a significant positive relationship between colocated consumers? response to coupons in the same product category. In addition, they show that incorporating consumers? location information can increase the accuracy of predicting the most likely conversions by 19%. These findings have important practical implications for marketers engaging in the fast-growing location-based mobile advertising industry.","machine learning",1

Uncertainty but Hurt Firm Performance?","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Investors, analysts, and regulators frequently advocate greater disclosure of nonfinancial information, such as customer metrics. Managers, however, argue that such metrics are costly to report, reveal sensitive information to competitors, and therefore will lower future cash flows. To examine these counterarguments, this study presents the first empirical examination of the prevalence and consequences of backward- and forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics by manually coding 511 annual reports of firms in two industries, telecommunications (365 reports) and airlines (146 reports). The results reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries, firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures. Notably, forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics are negatively associated with investors? uncertainty in both industries and with analysts? uncertainty in the telecommunications industry. Importantly, the results do not support the managerial thesis that such disclosures have a negative impact on future cash flows.","machine learning",0
"183","How to Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Improved Variable Selection for New Customer Acquisition","Journal of Marketing",2017,"Steady customer losses create pressure for firms to acquire new accounts, a task that is both costly and risky. Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees. Notably, the optimal results show that the Bayesian approach selects panel-based metrics as predictors, detects several nonlinear relationships, selects very large numbers of addresses, and generates profits. In a series of post hoc analyses, the authors consider prospects? response behaviors and cross-selling potential and systematically vary the number of predictors and the estimated profit per response. The results reveal that more predictors and higher response rates do not necessarily lead to higher profits.","machine learning",1
"184","A New Method to Aid Copy Testing of Paid Search Text Advertisements","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"The authors propose a new approach to evaluate the perceptions and performance of a large set of paid search ads. This approach consists of two parts. First, primary data on hundreds of ads are collected through paired comparisons of their relative ability to generate awareness, interest, desire, action, and click performance. The authors use the Elo algorithm, a statistical model calibrated on paired comparisons, to score the full set of ads on relative perceptions and click performance. The estimated scores validate the theoretical link between perceptions and performance. Second, the authors predict the perceptions and performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual content metrics. The predictive model allows for direct effects and interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a ?large p, small n? problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of equations. The authors demonstrate that this approach ably forecasts relative ad performance by leveraging perceptions inferred from content alone.","natural language processing",0
"185","Building Agent-Based Decision Support Systems for Word-of-Mouth Programs: A Freemium Application","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network?level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.","marketing insight",0
"186","Managing Status: How Luxury Brands Shape Class Subjectivities in the Service Encounter","Journal of Marketing",2017,"Although a large body of research has investigated how consumers use goods to signal their status, little is known about how brands manage status. The very few studies that have examined this topic are grounded in the traditional conception of status and focus on the possession and display of status signals. The authors offer an alternative understanding of status management by investigating the role of interactions in the service encounter. Drawing from extensive ethnographic work in luxury stores, they investigate how brands (re)configure the status games that surface in the service encounter. They show that through the material and social cues of the servicescape, brands shape consumers? class subjectivities?that is, they make consumers behave as class subjects who have a specific understanding of their position in the social hierarchy. Thus, managing status requires the active creation and management of consumers as class subjects. There is a shift from managing branded goods that signal status to managing customer experiences that make consumers enact status positions. This research helps identify new ways to manage status brands, especially luxury brands.","marketing insight",1
"187","Organizational Multichannel Differentiation: An Analysis of Its Impact on Channel Relationships and Company Sales Success","Journal of Marketing",2017,"This article examines whether and how a company's division of segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels affects the relationships in the multichannel (MC) system and, ultimately, the company's sales success. Building on open systems theory, the authors develop an overarching framework of organizational MC differentiation that distinguishes between two generic approaches: segment differentiation and task differentiation. They predict that these two approaches affect key relationship and performance outcomes of an MC system, but do so differently and contingent on key characteristics of the company's customers. Drawing on a multi-informant survey in a business-to-business context as well as on objective performance data, the authors find that segment differentiation tends to mitigate horizontal conflict and inhibit cooperation, while task differentiation reduces primarily vertical conflict and promotes cooperation. Moreover, depending on customer characteristics, segment differentiation may damage channel relationships overall and, in turn, limit company sales success, whereas task differentiation unambiguously promotes channel relationships and thus drives company sales success. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship and performance impact of MC systems? organizational structure and provide useful guidance on how managers should allocate segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels.","marketing insight",1
"188","Tweeting as a Marketing Tool: A Field Experiment in the TV Industry","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Many businesses today have adopted tweeting as a new form of product marketing. However, whether and how tweeting affects product demand remains inconclusive. The authors explore this question using a randomized field experiment on Sina Weibo, the top tweeting website in China. The authors collaborate with a major global media company and examine how the viewing of its TV shows is affected by (1) the media company's tweets about its shows, and (2) recruited Weibo influentials? retweets of the company tweets. The authors find that both company tweets and influential retweets increase show viewing, but in different ways. Company tweets directly boost viewing, whereas influential retweets increase viewing if the show tweet is informative. Meanwhile, influential retweets are more effective than company tweets in bringing new Weibo followers to the company, which indirectly increases viewing. The authors discuss recommendations on how to manage tweeting as a marketing tool.","interdisciplinary",0
"189","Should Anthropomorphized Brands Engage Customers? The Impact of Social Crowding on Brand Preferences","Journal of Marketing",2017,"Anthropomorphizing a brand (i.e., imbuing a brand with humanlike features) serves as an important brand positioning strategy for marketing managers. This research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy?positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not. Managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context. However, given that consumers often experience brands in a social context, this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences. Specifically, the authors show that consumers? inferences of an anthropomorphized brand's intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal, thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand. The authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding (goal-related vs. goal-unrelated). In particular, a goal-related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions, which, in turn, leads to greater preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies. In contrast, the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal-unrelated crowded settings.","interdisciplinary",1
"190","Keep Your Cool or Let it Out: Nonlinear Effects of Expressed Arousal on Perceptions of Consumer Reviews","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"This research explores how expressed emotional arousal in a consumer review affects reader perceptions of its helpfulness. Drawing from research on written communication and lay theories of emotion, the authors propose a pattern of diminishing returns, in which the marginal effect of arousal on perceived helpfulness is positive at low levels of arousal but diminishes at higher levels. Results of a field study using Apple's App Store, a follow-up survey, and two laboratory experiments provide consistent evidence for the predicted pattern. In addition, the results suggest that the nonlinear effect is explained in part by perceptions of reviewer effort and that the effect is stronger for products that are utilitarian in nature. By revealing a nuanced relationship between emotional expression and perceived helpfulness, these findings offer valuable implications for effective word-of-mouth communication.","interdisciplinary",0
"191","The Service?Profit Chain: A Meta-Analytic Test of a Comprehensive Theoretical Framework","Journal of Marketing",2017,"The service?profit chain (SPC) has served as a prominent guidepost for service managers and researchers alike. This meta-analysis provides the first comprehensive test of the SPC, showing that all the proposed links are statistically significant and substantial. However, the effect sizes vary considerably, partly according to the type of service provided. Meta-analytic structural equation models show that internal service quality translates into service performance through various mechanisms beyond employee satisfaction, and they highlight the importance of the service encounter and customer relationship characteristics for customer responses. The findings not only indicate the need to integrate complementary paths in the SPC framework but also challenge the implicit SPC rationale that firms should always maximize employee satisfaction and external service quality to optimize firm performance.","interdisciplinary",1
"192","Gamified Information Presentation and Consumer Adoption of Product Innovations","Journal of Marketing",2017,"This research examines the effect of gamified information presentation?conveying information about a product innovation in the form of a game?on consumer adoption of that innovation. The key hypothesis is that gamified information presentation promotes consumer innovation adoption and that it does so through two parallel psychological processes?by increasing consumer playfulness, which stimulates curiosity about the innovation, and by enhancing the perceived vividness of information presentation, which increases the perceived advantage of the innovation relative to (less innovative) competing products. Evidence from seven studies, including two field experiments, supports this theorizing. The results also show that for gamified information presentation to increase innovation adoption, it is essential that the information is integrated into the game. These findings advance the understanding of the psychological forces that govern how consumers respond to receiving product information in the form of games, and they have important practical implications for how firms might use gamified information presentation to promote sales of new products.","interdisciplinary",1

For example, of the 50 articles published in Journal of Marketing Research in 2013, only three (6%) were based on field experiments. The goal of this article is to motivate a methodological shift in marketing research and increase the proportion of empirical findings obtained using field experiments. The author begins by making a case for field experiments and offers a description of their defining features. She then demonstrates the unique value that field experiments can offer and concludes with a discussion of key considerations that researchers should be mindful of when designing, planning, and running field experiments.","interdisciplinary",0
"194","Interpreting the Stock Returns to New Product Announcements: How the past Shapes Investors? Expectations of the Future","Journal of Marketing Research",2017,"Investors routinely follow firms? communications and actions to form expectations about the firms? future performance. The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors? expectations of future firm performance.","sentiment analysis",0

More than ever, companies are discussing and disclosing information on the number of customers acquired and lost, customer lifetime value, and other data. This has fueled an increasing interest in linking the value of a firm's customers to the overall value of the firm, with the term ?customer-based corporate valuation? being used to describe such efforts. Although several researchers in the fields of marketing and accounting have explored this idea, their underlying models of customer acquisition and retention do not adequately reflect the empirical realities associated with these behaviors, and the associated valuation models do not meet the standards of finance professionals. The authors develop a framework for valuing subscription-based firms that addresses both issues, and they apply it to data from DISH Network and Sirius XM Holdings.","sentiment analysis",1

Thus, it can forewarn and be diagnostic about potential problems with automobile models, known as nameplates. The authors define ?perverse halo? (or negative spillover) as the phenomenon whereby negative chatter about one nameplate increases negative chatter for another nameplate. The authors test the existence of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance. Online chatter amplifies the negative effect of recalls on downstream sales by about 4.5 times.","Text Mining",0

Empirical evidence and behavioral research have suggested that consumers may perceive a firm's price as unfair when its profit margin is too high relative to consumers? surplus. The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price. Finally, as the expected cost efficiency in the market decreases, both the expected quality and the social surplus may increase rather than decrease.","user-generated-content",0

Rather than following the schedule dictated by television networks and consuming one episode of a series each week, many viewers now engage in binge watching, which involves consuming several episodes of the same series in a condensed period of time. In this research, the authors decompose users? viewing behavior into (1) whether the user continues the viewing session after each episode viewed, (2) whether the next episode viewed is from the same or a different series, and (3) the time elapsed between sessions. Applying this modeling framework to data provided by Hulu.com, a popular online provider of broadcast and cable television shows, the authors examine the drivers of binge watching behavior, distinguishing between user-level traits and states determined by previously viewed content. The authors simultaneously investigate users? response to advertisements. Many online video providers support their services with advertising revenue; thus, understanding how users respond to advertisements and how advertising affects subsequent viewing is of paramount importance to both advertisers and online video providers. The results of the study reveal that advertising responsiveness differs between bingers and nonbingers and that it changes over the course of online viewing sessions.

On average, eWOM is positively correlated with sales (.091), but its effectiveness differs across platform, product, and metric factors. For example, the effectiveness of eWOM on social media platforms is stronger when eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity to eWOM senders, whereas these homophily details do not influence the effectiveness of eWOM for e-commerce platforms. In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services. With respect to the eWOM metrics, eWOM volume has a stronger impact on sales than eWOM valence. In addition, negative eWOM does not always jeopardize sales, but high variability does.","user-generated-content",0

"214","Demonstrating the Value of Marketing","Journal of Marketing",2016,"Marketing departments are under increased pressure to demonstrate their economic value to the firm. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that marketing uses attitudinal (e.g., brand awareness), behavioral (e.g., brand loyalty), and financial (e.g., sales revenue) performance metrics, which do not correlate highly with each other. Thus, one metric could view marketing initiatives as successful, whereas another could interpret them as a waste of resources. The resulting ambiguity has several consequences for marketing practice. Among these are that the scope and objectives of marketing differ widely across organizations. There is confusion about the difference between marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Hard and soft metrics and offline and online metrics are typically not integrated. The two dominant tools for marketing impact assessment, response models and experiments, are rarely combined. Risk in marketing planning and execution receives little consideration, and analytic insights are not communicated effectively to drive decisions. The authors first examine how these factors affect both research and practice. They then discuss how the use of marketing analytics can improve marketing decision making at different levels of the organization. The authors identify gaps in marketing's knowledge base that set the stage for further research and enhanced practice in demonstrating marketing's value.","machine learning",1

The authors test the existence of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance.

As a means of taking stock of academic work's ability to contribute to this revolution, this article tracks the changes in scholarly researchers? perspectives on three major digital, social media, and mobile (DSMM) marketing themes from 2000 to 2015. The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000. They then identify key themes emerging in five-year time frames during this period: (1) DSMM as a facilitator of individual expression, (2) DSMM as decision support tool, and (3) DSMM as a market intelligence source. In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice. Finally, in light of this, an agenda for future research based on emerging research topics is advanced.","marketing insight",1
"221","Choosing Variety for Joint Consumption","Journal of Marketing Research",2016,"Consumers often make choices for joint consumption with committed relationship partners, and these choices may include more or less variety. When planning a weekend for oneself and one's spouse, for example, a person could choose more varied activities (e.g., going out to dinner, to a movie, and to a concert) or less varied activities (e.g., seeing several different movies). What might affect how much variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner. The findings demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on personal or situational factors but also on aspects of consumers? social relationships.","interdisciplinary",0

Within such a ?target? space, shoppers are exposed to a selection of product categories that are not necessarily correlated in consumption. In this article, the authors examine whether the assortment of one category affects consumers? purchase incidence decision in another, independent category that shares a common display space (e.g., frozen meals and ice cream). They use a multivariate probit model of purchase incidence and incorporate assortment variety captured by an entropy measure. Results from analyses of IRI data and an online experiment provide strong evidence that consumers are less likely to purchase from a category of a given assortment when it is presented with another category assortment of greater variety and that this effect is driven by the display proximity. Furthermore, results from an eye-tracking study indicate consumers? allocation of limited attention to category assortments as an explanation for the finding. This work serves as one of the first studies to document the impact of product assortment beyond a focal category, and the results highlight a limitation of individual category management when grocery retailers make product assortment decisions.","interdisciplinary",1
"225","Stock Returns on Customer Satisfaction Do Beat the Market: Gauging the Effect of a Marketing Intangible","Journal of Marketing",2016,"A debate about whether firms with superior customer satisfaction earn superior stock returns has been persistent in the literature. Using 15 years of audited returns, the authors find convincing empirical evidence that stock returns on customer satisfaction do beat the market. The recorded cumulative returns were 518% over the years studied (2000?2014), compared with a 31% increase for the S&P 500. Similar results using back-tested instead of real returns were found in the United Kingdom. The effect of customer satisfaction on stock price is, at least in part, channeled through earnings surprises. Consistent with theory, customer satisfaction has an effect on earnings themselves. In addition, the authors examine the effect of stock returns from earnings on stock returns from customer satisfaction. If earnings returns are included among the risk factors in the asset pricing model, the earnings variable partially mitigates the returns on customer satisfaction. Because of the long time series, it is also possible to examine time periods when customer satisfaction returns were below market. The reversal of the general trend largely resulted from short-term market idiosyncrasies with little or no support from fundamentals. Such irregularities have been infrequent and eventually self-correcting. The authors provide reasons why irregularities may occur from time to time.","interdisciplinary",1

This study integrates extant research findings and establishes empirical generalizations on marketing's impact on firm value. Specifically, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of prior econometric elasticity estimates of the stock market impact of marketing actions and marketing assets. Analyses based on 488 elasticities drawn from 83 studies reveal a mean elasticity of .04 for advertising expenditure variables and of .54 for marketing asset variables. Among marketing assets, customer-related assets show a higher mean elasticity of .72, compared with .33 for brand-related assets. Further analyses show that advertising elasticities are lower in more concentrated industries and that marketing asset elasticities are higher during recession times. Researchers should also be aware that characteristics of the research design (e.g., the type of firm value metric used, the omission of control variables, or not accounting for endogeneity) may affect the estimation results.","interdisciplinary",0
"227","Does Sparing the Rod Spoil the Child? How Praising, Scolding, and an Assertive Tone Can Encourage Desired Behaviors","Journal of Marketing Research",2016,"In search of effective ways to encourage consumers to follow desired behaviors such as healthy eating, recycling, or financial planning, marketers sometimes use praise (e.g., ?You are doing great?) and sometimes use scolding (e.g., ?You are not doing enough?). However, the effectiveness of each approach in triggering behavior is not clear. A possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone. This research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone. The authors then replicate these field findings in a controlled laboratory experiment, which also provides click rates as an actual behavioral outcome.","interdisciplinary",0

"229","The Influence of Serotonin Deficiency on Choice Deferral and the Compromise Effect","Journal of Marketing Research",2016,"Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress, and sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and therefore crucially influence consumer behavior. A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, the authors pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects? cognitive resources. In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects? tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision making.","interdisciplinary",0
"230","Consumer Preferences for Annuity Attributes: Beyond Net Present Value","Journal of Marketing Research",2016,"Decisions about life annuities are an important part of consumer decumulation of retirement assets, yet they are relatively underexplored by marketing researchers studying consumer financial decision making. In this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.","interdisciplinary",0
"231","Brand Buzz in the Echoverse","Journal of Marketing",2016,"Social media sites have created a reverberating ?echoverse? for brand communication, forming complex feedback loops (?echoes?) between the ?universe? of corporate communications, news media, and user-generated social media. To understand these feedback loops, the authors process longitudinal, unstructured data using computational linguistics techniques and analyze them using econometric methods. By assembling one of the most comprehensive data sets in the brand communications literature with corporate communications, news stories, social media, and business outcomes, the authors document the echoverse (i.e., feedback loops between all of these sources). Furthermore, the echoverse has changed as online word of mouth has become prevalent. Over time, online word of mouth has fallen into a negativity spiral, with negative messages leading to greater volume, and firms are adjusting their communications strategies in response. The nature of brand communications has been transformed by online technology as corporate communications move increasingly from one to many (e.g., advertising) to one to one (e.g., Twitter) while consumer word of mouth moves from one to one (e.g., conversations) to one to many (e.g., social media). The results indicate that companies benefit from using social media (e.g., Twitter) for personalized customer responses, although there is still a role for traditional brand communications (e.g., press releases, advertising). The evolving echoverse requires managers to rethink brand communication strategies, with online communications becoming increasingly central.","sentiment analysis",1

This study examines (1) the direct effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance variables (buyer's click rate and seller's click price), and (3) how the effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage. Finally, using cost data from the platform, this article examines the economic returns of attracting new and existing buyers and sellers with respect to advertising revenue.","UGC",0

"237","Fanning the Flames? how Media Coverage of a Price War Affects Retailers, Consumers, and Investors","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"This article explores how media coverage of a price war affects customer, retailer, and investor reactions over time. Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003?2005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.","user-generated-content",0

Participants completed the App Recommendation Task?a task that captures neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is significantly correlated with participants changing their recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects. Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the concept of being a ?successful idea salesperson,? respectively. Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference shifts and consideration of the mental states of others in recommendation environments that include peer opinions.","user-generated-content",0

On average, a passenger is approximately 30% more likely to buy an item after being exposed to a lateral purchase. Analyses on the underlying mechanisms reveal that the classical social influence theories do not suffice to explain all the patterns in the data. The author proposes omission neglect, product contagion, and goal balancing as complementary theories. Finally, consumers? willingness to buy is shown to be positively correlated with responsiveness to social influence. This finding indicates that homophily and social feedback effects?classically viewed in the literature as nuisances?can provide targeting value for the firm. By taking these factors into account during behavior-based targeting, firms can double the social spillovers of marketing actions.","user-generated-content",0

The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.","user-generated-content",1

Here we combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. We show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed via reflective processes, brand personality traits appear to exist a priori inside the minds of consumers, such that we were able to predict what brand a person is thinking about based solely on the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloguing brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining mental constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.","machine learning",0

However, some pertinent questions remain as to whether lost customers are worth the investment in reacquisition and whether they will remain profitable if reacquired. This is the first study to empirically demonstrate how (1) the lost customers' first-lifetime experiences and behaviors, (2) the reason for defection, and (3) the nature of the win-back offer made to lost customers are all related to the likelihood of their reacquisition, their second-lifetime duration, and their second-lifetime profitability per month. The study shows that the stronger the first-lifetime relationship with the firm, the more likely a customer is to accept the win-back offer. This study also presents relevant implications for managers interested in identifying new avenues for growth through effective resource allocation on the reacquisition and management of lost customers. Finally, the authors outline if and when managers should choose between maximizing reacquisition and profitability.","marketing insight",1
"247","Navigating the Institutional Logics of Markets: Implications for Strategic Brand Management","Journal of Marketing",2015,"Adopting an institutional theoretic framework, this article examines the evolution and competitive dynamics of markets composed of multiple practices, beliefs, and rule systems. The 30-year historical analysis of the U.S. yoga market illustrates the coexistence of spirituality, medical, fitness, and commercial logics. Using data gathered through archival sources, netnography, in-depth interviews, and participant observations, the authors link shifting emphases on institutional logics and their sustenance to institutional entrepreneurs? accumulation and transmission of cultural capital, strategies to legitimize plural logics, distinct branding practices, and contestations among the pervading logics. The study offers a managerial framework for managing conflicting demands of logics, conveying brand legitimacy, and creating a coherent brand identity in plural logic markets; in addition, it develops a theoretical account of links between institutional logics, competitive dynamics, and market evolution.","marketing insight",1
"248","Feeling Love and Doing More for Distant Others: Specific Positive Emotions Differentially Affect Prosocial Consumption","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love?as a trait and a momentary emotion?is unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.","interdisciplinary",0
"249","Individual Differences in Marketing Placebo Effects: Evidence from Brain Imaging and Behavioral Experiments","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"A wealth of research has explored whether marketing-based expectancies such as price and brand quality beliefs influence the consumption experience and subsequent behavior, but almost no research has examined individual differences in ?marketing placebo effects.? In this article, the authors suggest three moderators of the effect of marketing-based expectancies on the behavioral and neural measures of the consumption experience, based on previous findings from neuroscientific literature investigating traditional clinical pain placebo effects. They use a novel automated structural brain imaging approach to determine individual differences and combine this approach with traditional behavioral experiments. The findings show that consumers high in reward seeking, low in somatosensory awareness, and high in need for cognition are more responsive to marketing placebo effects.","interdisciplinary",0
"250","Consumer Neuroscience: Applications, Challenges, and Possible Solutions","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"The first decade of consumer neuroscience research has produced groundbreaking work in identifying the basic neural processes underlying human judgment and decision making, with the majority of such studies published in neuroscience journals and influencing models of brain function. Yet for the field of consumer neuroscience to thrive in the next decade, the current emphasis on basic science research must be extended into marketing theory and practice. The authors suggest five concrete ways that neuroscientific methods can be fruitfully applied to marketing. They then outline three fundamental challenges facing consumer neuroscientists and offer potential solutions for addressing them. The authors conclude by describing how consumer neuroscience can become an important complement to research and practice in marketing.","interdisciplinary",0
"251","Developing Donor Relationships: The Role of the Breadth of Giving","Journal of Marketing",2015,"This research proposes a mechanism to develop long-term donor relationships, a major challenge in the nonprofit industry. The authors propose a metric, donation variety, which captures a donor's breadth of donations with a given nonprofit organization, controlling for the distribution of donations to different initiatives. Using donation data spanning 20 years from a major U.S. public university, the authors find that improvements in donation variety increase the likelihood that the donor will make a subsequent donation, increase the donation amount, and reduce the sensitivity of donations to negative macroeconomic shocks. In the acquisition phase, most donors give to a single initiative, and these decisions are more influenced by a donor's intrinsic motivations. In contrast, as the donor?nonprofit organization relationship develops over time, nonprofit marketing efforts have a more significant influence on a donor's decision to give to multiple initiatives. Finally, the authors conduct a field study that validates the econometric analysis and provides causal evidence that marketing efforts by nonprofit organizations can encourage donors to spread donations across multiple initiatives.","interdisciplinary",1
"252","New Product Design: Concept, Measurement, and Consequences","Journal of Marketing",2015,"Product design is a source of competitive advantage for companies and is an important driver of company performance. Drawing on an extensive literature review and consumer interviews, the authors define product design and its dimensions. Using data from three samples (6,418 U.S. consumers and 1,083 and 583 European consumers), the authors develop and validate a new scale to measure product design along the dimensions of aesthetics, functionality, and symbolism. In addition, they investigate the impact of these design dimensions on purchase intention, word of mouth, and willingness to pay. The results indicate that the design dimensions positively influence willingness to pay and also have a positive effect on purchase intention and word of mouth, both directly and indirectly through brand attitude.","interdisciplinary",1
"253","Consumers? Response to Commercials: When the Energy Level in the Commercial Conflicts with the Media Context","Journal of Marketing",2015,"This research examines how media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness induced by a movie) find it more difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e.g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a meta-analysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50% more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials.","interdisciplinary",1
"254","Beyond Fungible: Transforming Money into Moral and Social Resources","Journal of Marketing",2015,"An essential characteristic of marketing practice and theory is the promotion of exchanges, many of which are funded by money. Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding. The article closes with a discussion of implications for marketing managers and potential avenues for further research.","interdisciplinary",1
"255","What's in a Message? The Longitudinal Influence of a Supportive versus Combative Orientation on the Performance of Nonprofits","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"In this article, the authors propose that in the long run, a nonprofit organization with supportively oriented positioning (e.g., promoting a cause) is likely to survive longer and achieve more donations compared with a nonprofit with a combative orientation (e.g., fighting against something). To test this proposition, the authors adopt a three-pronged approach that (1) uses publicly available financial data from nonprofits? tax filings over a ten-year period, (2) measures annual donor pledges from a field study with a registered nonprofit organization, and (3) examines actual donation behavior of participants in a longitudinal lab study. Moreover, the authors test this proposition for donations of money as well as time. They consider various theoretical mechanisms that might cause the proposed effect, such as regulatory focus theory, inertia in giving, and the preponderance of supportive charities.","interdisciplinary",0
"256","Scarcity Polarizes Preferences: The Impact on Choice among Multiple Items in a Product Class","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"This research examines how the salience of scarcity influences choices of individual items from a product class. The authors propose that overall perception of scarcity versus overall perception of abundance increases choice share of the most-preferred item from a product class. They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is mediated by consumers? reported arousal level and moderated by an experimentally induced arousal state.","interdisciplinary",0
"257","Marketing Communication Strategies and Consumer Financial Decision Making: The Role of National Culture","Journal of Marketing",2015,"Consumers frequently make important financial decisions that have short- and long-term impacts on their welfare. The authors expect that these financial decisions are a function of consumers' past experiences and interactions with a financial services firm as well as consumers' long-term priorities (e.g., national culture). They determine how three cultural dimensions (long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity) and marketing communication type (promotion focused vs. prevention focused) affect three key consumer financial decisions: (1) savings rate, (2) use of credit, and (3) spending pattern. To do so, they empirically test both the direct effect of national culture on consumer financial decision making and its moderating effect on the link between a firm's marketing efforts and consumer financial decision making. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors develop and empirically test their hypotheses using a customer database from a multinational financial services firm based in the United Arab Emirates, with customers originating from 34 countries. They find that national culture directly affects consumer financial decision making and moderates the impact of marketing efforts by the financial services firm, which suggests that financial services firms should account for national culture when managing customers.","interdisciplinary",1
"258","Measuring and Managing Consumer Sentiment in an Online Community Environment","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"As social media and virtual communities increase in popularity, the spread of word of mouth becomes easier, challenging firms to measure and manage the success of marketing initiatives in online community environments. This research examines how consumers react to firms' active participation in consumer-to-consumer conversations in an online community setting. The authors develop a tailored community-matched measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than 115,000 consumer posts from ten online forums with active firm participation. The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment. These findings provide insights for marketing performance measurement and resource allocation in online communities.","sentiment analysis",0
"259","Fanning the Flames? how Media Coverage of a Price War Affects Retailers, Consumers, and Investors","Journal of Marketing Research",2015,"This article explores how media coverage of a price war affects customer, retailer, and investor reactions over time. Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003?2005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.","sentiment analysis",0

"261","Transformational Relationship Events","Journal of Marketing",2015,"Exchange events are fundamental building blocks of business relationships and essential to relationship development. However, some events contribute to incremental relationship development, as predicted by lifecycle theories, whereas others spark ?turning points? with dramatic impacts on the relationship. Such transformational relationship events (TREs) are encounters between exchange partners that significantly disconfirm relational expectations (positively or negatively), result in dramatic, discontinuous change to the relationship's trajectory, and often reformulate the relationship itself. With a three-study, multimethod design, the authors (1) establish a foundation for differentiating dramatic and incremental exchange events on the basis of relational versus product expectations and disconfirmations, thus revealing that strong relationships benefit product but harm relational disconfirmations; and (2) conceptualize, define, and differentiate TREs from other types of disconfirming events, then link them to exchange performance.","sentiment analysis",1

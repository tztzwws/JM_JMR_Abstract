"Marketing Renaissance: Opportunities and Imperatives for Improving Marketing Thought, Practice, and Infrastructure",Journal of Marketing,2005,"My three-year term as editor of Journal of Marketing concludes with the October 2005 issue. On the basis of my interactions with various people in the marketing community, I believe that marketing science and practice are in transition, bringing change to the content and boundaries of the discipline. Thus, I invited some distinguished scholars to contribute short essays on the current challenges, opportunities, and imperatives for improving marketing thought and practice.Each author chose his or her topic and themes. However, in a collegial process, the authors read and commented on one another's essays, after which each author had an opportunity to revise his or her essay. The result is a thoughtful and constructive set of essays that are related to one another in interesting ways and that should be read together. I have grouped the essays as follows:?What is the domain of marketing? This question is addressed in four essays by Stephen W. Brown, Frederick E. Webster Jr., Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, and William L. Wilkie.?How has the marketing landscape (i.e., content) changed? This question is addressed in two essays, one coauthored by Jagdish N. Sheth and Rajendra S. Sisodia and the other by Roger A. Kerin.?How should marketing academics engage in research, teaching, and professional activities? This question is addressed in five essays by Debbie MacInnis; Leigh McAlister; Jagmohan S. Raju; Ronald J. Bauerly, Don T. Johnson, and Mandeep Singh; and Richard Staelin.Another interesting way to think about the essays, as Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp suggests, is to group the essays according to whether they address issues of content, publishing, or impact (see Table 1).These 11 essays strike a common theme: They urge marketers?both scientists and practitioners?to expand their horizontal vision. What do I mean by horizontal vision? In The Great Influenza, Barry (2004) describes the enormous strides that were made in medical science early in the twentieth century. His depiction of William Welch, an extremely influential scientist who did not (as a laboratory researcher) generate important findings, includes a characterization of the ?genius? that produces major scientific achievements.The research he did was first-rate. But it was only first-rate?thorough, rounded, and even irrefutable, but not deep enough or provocative enough or profound enough to set himself or others down new paths, to show the world in a new way, to make sense out of great mysteries?. To do this requires a certain kind of genius, one that probes vertically and sees horizontally. Horizontal vision allows someone to assimilate and weave together seemingly unconnected bits of information. It allows an investigator to see what others do not see and to make leaps of connectivity and creativity. Probing vertically, going deeper and deeper into something, creates new information. (p. 60)At my request, each author has provided thoughtful and concrete suggestions for how marketing academics and practitioners, both individually and collectively (through our institutions), can work to improve our field. Many of their suggestions urge people and institutions to expand their horizontal vision and make connections, thereby fulfilling their potential to advance the science and practice of marketing. In his essay, Richard Staelin writes (p. 22), ?I believe that it is possible to influence directly the generation and adoption of new ideas.? I agree. I ask the reader to think about the ideas in these essays and to act on them. Through our actions, we shape our future.?Ruth N. Bolton",0
Erratum,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"White, Katherine, Lily Lin, Darren W. Dahl, and Robin J. B. Ritchie (2016), ?When Do Consumers Avoid Imperfections? Superficial Packaging Damage as a Contamination Cue,? Journal of Marketing Research, 53 (February), 110?23. (Original DOI: 10.1509/jmr.12.0388)The following reporting errors have been noted in this article. These errors were clerical only, and the changes do not affect the data patterns or significance of the results in any way.Study 1, page 113The numerator degrees of freedom for the interaction should be 2. At the end of the last full paragraph, the text should read: ?The interaction qualified a significant main effect for type of package damage (F(2, 139) = 4.90, p < .05) and a marginal main effect for cognitive load (F(1, 139) = 3.36, p < .07).?Study 2, page 115The degrees of freedom should be 130. The text should read: ?Results revealed a main effect for packaging damage (t(130) = 5.49, p < .001; b = ?.561) and the anticipated three-way interaction (t(130) = 2.24, p < .03; b = ?.286; see Figureÿ2).?Study 4, page 116The numerator degrees of freedom was omitted in one sentence. The text should read: ?As we predicted, packaging appearance predicted both contamination perceptions (F(2, 150) = 4.17, p < .05) and health and safety concerns (F(2, 150) = 3.41, p < .05; see Tableÿ1).?Study 5, page 118The initial sample size is 200 participants. The text should say: ?Those who failed to properly complete the cognitive load task were removed from the analyses (9.5% of the sample, leaving 181 participants).?",1
The Value Relevance of Brand Attitude in High-Technology Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors assess the extent to which brand attitude, a key component of brand equity, has value relevance?that is, helps predict future earnings and thus firm value?in high-technology markets. Using data for firms in the computer industries, the authors find that changes in brand attitude are associated contemporaneously with stock return and lead accounting financial performance. The study also provides insights into the drivers of brand attitude. The authors find that both product attributes and peripheral cues shape brand attitudes in high-technology markets.",1
Understanding Regulatory Fit,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors focus on three critical areas of future research on regulatory fit. First, they focus on how regulatory orientation is sustained. The authors argue that there are two distinct approaches that bring about the ?just-right feeling?: (1) a process-based approach that involves the interaction between regulatory orientation and decision-making processes and (2) an outcome-based approach that involves the interaction between regulatory orientation and the framed outcomes offered. Second, the authors discuss possible boundary conditions of regulatory fit effects, highlighting the apparent paradoxical role of involvement. They suggest that the antecedents that give rise to regulatory fit (e.g., lowered motivation) can differ from its consequences (e.g., increased motivation). Third, the authors discuss broader implications of regulatory fit, proposing three possible mechanisms by which regulatory fit can lead to improved physical health and discussing the degree to which the just-right feeling plays a role in goal-sustaining experiences related to subjective well-being (e.g., flow).",1
Competitive Response to Radical Product Innovations,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Radical product innovations are often agents of creative destruction. They threaten to destroy existing market positions, and yet they often yield vast new market opportunities. This article examines how competitors respond to the introduction of radical product innovations. The authors argue that competitive response to radical product innovations is inherently different from response to the incremental innovations that are typically studied in existing research. They introduce the dual concepts of market expansion and entry thresholds to develop new hypotheses about competitive response. Some of these hypotheses contradict prior literature. Using objective data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry between 1997 and 2001, they estimate a shared-frailty hazard model to explain the competitive response to radical product innovations. The results show that the likelihood of competitive response is substantially higher when the introducing firm is large or market dependent. Moreover, the response is highest when the innovation is introduced in a small market by a large firm. These results contradict those from much prior research on competitive response to product innovation.",0
When Does Partitioned Pricing Lead to More Favorable Consumer Preferences?: Meta-Analytic Evidence,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Evidence of the impact of partitioned pricing is contradictory. Research indicates that partitioning a price into multiple components can result in more favorable preferences, due to a lower recalled price, or less favorable preferences, due to unfavorable surcharge evaluations. To explain these divergent effects, the authors examine the role of price presentation moderators, which reflect how managers convey prices to consumers (e.g., Is the total price present or absent?), magnitude moderators, which reflect the actual prices charged (e.g., What is the surcharge magnitude?), and contextual moderators, which reflect nonprice transaction characteristics (e.g., Is the product category hedonic or utilitarian?). A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category, when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the product category is utilitarian.",1
Parameter Bias from Unobserved Effects in the Multinomial Logit Model of Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Over the past two decades, validation of choice models has focused on predictive validity rather than parameter bias. In real-world validation of choice models, true parameter values are unknown, so examination of parameter bias is not possible. In contrast, the main focus of this study is parameter bias in simulated scanner-panel choice data with known parameter values. Study of parameter bias enables the assessment of a fundamental issue not addressed in the choice modeling literature?the extent to which the logit choice model is capable of distinguishing unobserved effects that give rise to persistence in observed choices (e.g., heterogeneity and state dependence). Although econometric theory provides some information about the causes of bias, the extent of such bias in typical scanner data applications remains unclear. The authors present an extensive simulation study that provides information on the extent of bias resulting from the misspecification of four unobserved effects that receive frequent attention in the literature?choice set effects, heterogeneity in preferences and market response, state dependence, and serial correlation. The authors outline implications for model builders and managers. In general, the potential for parameter bias in choice model applications appears to be high. Overall, a logit model with choice set effects and the Guadagni?Little loyalty variable produces the most valid parameter estimates.",1
Fear of Detection and Efficacy of Prevention: Using Construal Level to Encourage Health Behaviors,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research examines the psychological processes and factors that shape illness-detection versus illness-prevention health actions. Four experiments using contexts of mental health, skin cancer, and breast cancer show that illness detection evokes fear, which undermines engagement in detection behaviors. Considering detection at low (vs. high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion. Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as serving illness-prevention goals increased people?s likelihood of engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have divergent effects on health persuasion.",1
The Impact of Relative Standards on the Propensity to Disclose,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Two sets of studies illustrate the comparative nature of disclosure behavior. The first set investigates how divulgence is affected by signals about others' readiness to divulge and shows a ?herding? effect: Survey respondents are more willing to divulge sensitive information when told that previous respondents have made sensitive disclosures (Study 1a). The authors provide evidence of the process underlying this effect and rule out alternative explanations by showing that information on others' propensity to disclose affects respondents' discomfort associated with divulgence (Study 1b) but not their interpretation of the questions (Study 1c). The second set of studies investigates how divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a). The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b). The effect is altered when, at the outset of the study, privacy concerns are primed (Study 2c) and when respondents are made to consider the relative intrusiveness of a different set of questions (Study 2d). This research helps illuminate how consumers' propensity to disclose is affected by continual streams of requests for personal information and by the equally unavoidable barrage of personal information about others.",1
Conscious and Nonconscious Comparisons with Price Anchors: Effects on Willingness to Pay for Related and Unrelated Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Exposing consumers to extreme prices can influence the price they are willing to pay for both related and unrelated products. Drawing on previous theories of anchoring and adjustment and selective accessibility of judgment-relevant knowledge, the authors provide an account of both asymmetries in the impact of price anchors across product categories and contingencies in the occurrence of these asymmetries. Four studies show the deliberate consideration of price anchors that can play a key role in whether the effect of the anchors will generalize across product categories. Specifically, an explicit comparison of a product to a price anchor increases the accessibility of features that represent a product available at this price. In turn, these thoughts influence the price that consumers are willing to pay for these products. In the absence of this deliberation, however, anchors influence both related and unrelated products, provided no other cognitive activity occurs in the interim.",1
Integrating Producers at the Base of the Pyramid with Global Markets: A Market Learning Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"International marketing literature suggests that through market learning, businesses develop market-valued capabilities that are the basis of their performance. Therefore, market learning is also of importance to producers at the base of the pyramid (BoP), whose ability to climb out of poverty often depends on the purchasing power of those in export markets. However, the ways in which BoP-producer-based export chains learn from foreign users of their products and incorporate these insights into their decisions are not yet clear. Using case studies from Benin, the authors examine how market learning processes function in supply chains at the BoP. A cross-case comparison suggests that market connections are established when export market information is generated by formal-sector organizations and when such organizations establish formal ways of sharing information with BoP producers. The access to export markets becomes sustainable if formal institutions also support the use of information. The study has implications for procurement by exporters and for pro-poor development.",0
Split Questionnaire Design for Massive Surveys,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Companies are conducting more and longer surveys than ever before. Massive questionnaires are pervasive in marketing practice. As an alternative to the heuristic methods that are currently used to split questionnaires, this study develops a methodology to design the split questionnaire in a way that minimizes information loss. Using estimates from a first wave or pilot study, the authors apply the modified Fedorov algorithm using the Kullback?Leibler distance as a design criterion to find the optimal splits. Their design criterion is based on a general mixed data model that accommodates continuous, rank-ordered, and discrete measurement scales. The optimal construction of the split questionnaire design is easy and fast. The authors use Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures to impute missing values that result from the design. They generate split questionnaire designs by selecting either entire blocks of questions (between-block design) or sets of questions in each block (within-block design). They compare the efficiency of split questionnaires generated with the proposed method with multiple matrix sampling designs, incomplete block designs, and a heuristic procedure, using synthetic and empirical Web survey data. The authors illustrate in a field study that as a result of reduced respondent burden, the quality of data using split questionnaire designs improves.",1
"Location, Location, Location: An Analysis of Profitability of Position in Online Advertising Markets",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors evaluate the impact of ad placement on revenues and profits generated from sponsored search. Their approach uses data generated through a field experiment for several keywords from an online retailer's ad campaign. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the authors measure the impact of ad placement on both click-through and conversion rates. They find that while click-through rate decreases with position, conversion rate increases with position and is even higher for more specific keywords. The net effect is that, contrary to the conventional wisdom in the industry, the topmost position is not necessarily the revenue-or profit-maximizing position. The authors? results inform the advertising strategies of firms participating in sponsored search auctions and provide insight into consumer behavior in these environments. Specifically, they help correct a significant misunderstanding among advertisers regarding the value of the top position. Furthermore, they reveal potential inefficiencies in current auction mechanisms that search engines use. The authors? results also reveal the information search strategies that consumers use in sponsored search and provide evidence of recency bias for immediate purchases.",1
A Cross-National and Cross-Cultural Approach to Global Market Segmentation: An Application Using Consumers? Perceived Service Quality,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"The spread of global culture is being facilitated by the proliferation of transnational corporations, the rise of global capitalism, widespread aspiration for material possessions, and the homogenization of global consumption. The extent of convergence of cultural values across nations has been debated by international marketing researchers. However, from a practical standpoint, transnational firms require a cross-national, cross-cultural approach to market segmentation that can be used to guide the development of global marketing strategies. In this study, the authors investigate the application of cross-national versus cross-cultural approaches to market segmentation through a rigorous empirical investigation in the context of banking services. Although services constitute the fastest growing sector of the world economy, few studies have examined global market segmentation strategies for them. The authors develop theory-based cross-national hypotheses and test them by estimating a structural model of consumers? perceived service quality using survey data from two countries: the United States and India. They test cross-cultural hypotheses by estimating the same model on culture-based clusters. They demonstrate that there are distinctive differences between cross-national and cross-cultural models of perceived service quality and highlight the growing relevance of cross-cultural research approaches. More generally, the cross-national, cross-cultural approach to market segmentation can guide the development of global marketing strategies for services and improve business performance.",0
Developing Global Segments and Forecasting Market Shares: A Simultaneous Approach Using Survey Data,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Managers who introduce a new product into the global market must answer critical questions about market size, market responsiveness, and segmentation strategy. Current methods provide a piecemeal approach toward answering these questions. This article provides a new integrated method. The author uses survey-based discrete-choice methodology coupled with latent-class models to identify responsive global segments for a new global satellite-based paging service. The findings reveal seven distinct segments in terms of price responsiveness, size, and market potential. The author shows how these data can be used to develop target segments and marketing strategies. The study adds to the growing literature on international segmentation and pricing.",0
Socio-Cultural Distance and the Choice of Joint Ventures: A Contingency Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"It is widely believed that firms choose joint venture forms overseas when confronted with high socio-cultural distance. However, the probability of choosing the joint venture form is expected to be moderated by the firm-specific characteristics of the investing firm as well as country-specific characteristics of the country of investment. This study examines the moderating role of some firm- and country-specific factors on a firm's choice of joint venture form in response to socio-cultural distance. The firm-specific factors examined in this study include size, multinationality, and technological intensity; and the country-specific factors examined in this study include country risk and market potential. Recent data from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms is used to test the contingency hypotheses. Results indicate the usefulness of the contingency approach for modeling choice of joint ventures.",0
Seeing the Big Picture: The Effect of Height on the Level of Construal,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Drawing on research on grounded cognition and metaphorical representation, the authors propose and confirm in five studies that physical height, or even the mere concept of height, can affect the perceptual and conceptual levels of mental construal. As such, consumers who perceive themselves to be physically ?high? or elevated are more likely to adopt a global perceptual processing and higher level of conceptual construal, whereas those who perceive themselves to be physically ?low? are more likely to adopt a local perceptual processing and lower level of conceptual construal. This difference in construal level also affects product choices that involve trade-offs between long-term benefits and short-term effort. The authors address alternative accounts such as vertical distance, visual distance, and perceived power. By highlighting the novel relationship between height and construal level, these findings contribute to research on grounded cognition and construal-level theory while also providing practical suggestions to marketing managers across a variety of domains.",1
Emotional Compatibility and the Effectiveness of Antidrinking Messages: A Defensive Processing Perspective on Shame and Guilt,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Five studies examine how the two distinct emotional states of shame and guilt influence the effectiveness of messages that highlight socially undesirable consequences of alcohol consumption. Appeals that frame others as observing versus suffering the negative consequences of binge drinking differentially activate shame and guilt. Given these emotional consequences of message framing, the authors examine the interaction between incidental shame or guilt and message framing on drinking intentions and behavior. Compatible appeals (i.e., appeals that elicit the same emotion as being incidentally experienced by the consumer) are less effective in influencing behavioral intentions and beverage consumption because of a process in which consumers discount the notion that they may cause the negative consequences outlined in the message. Such defensive processing of compatible messages is driven by a desire to reduce the existing negative emotion.",1
Getting Emotional about Health,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The consequences of illness have two crucial types of stakes: for the self and for the family. Therefore, this research examines the effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self or for the family, focusing specifically on the dual role of emotions in serving these stakes as a provider of resources and information. The authors theorize that (1) the valence dimension of discrete emotions influences resources, thus fostering or hindering the processing of aversive health information, whereas (2) the self-/other-relatedness dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with the focal referent in the message (self or family) to determine compatibility. In Experiments 1?3, the authors demonstrate that when people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility hinders processing of the message. In Experiment 4, the authors track emotions before and after exposure to a health message to demonstrate that the observed effect occurs because of an increase in the negative emotional state in compatible situations when people process disease-related information. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for increasing the effectiveness of health-related messages.",1
The Effect of Review Writing on Learning Engagement in Channel Partner Relationship Management,Journal of Marketing,2018,"To develop the knowledge and skill sets of channel partner firms, manufacturers increasingly introduce learning programs as part of their relationship management strategies. However, the engagement of channel partners in these programs tends to be low. The current research, conducted in collaboration with a Fortune 100 information technology company, examines ways to strengthen learning engagement. In accordance with self-regulated learning theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that when channel partners write reviews of a learning module that they attended, beyond providing ratings, they are better able to reflect on the relevance of their learning experience and are further engaged in learning activities. The audience and focus of these written reviews determine the engagement of the channel partner sales personnel; therefore, review writing is a valuable, informal mechanism to motivate them. These effects are moderated by characteristics of both the channel partner (salesperson's learning orientation and identification with the manufacturer) and the relationship with the manufacturer (length and exclusivity).",0
Curvilinear Effects of Consumer Loyalty Determinants in Relational Exchanges,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Drawing from need, motivation, and social exchange theories, this study conceptualizes and empirically examines the differential curvilinear effects of multiple determinants of loyalty intentions, including transactional satisfaction, trust, and value for relational exchanges. The authors conceptualize trust as a ?motivator,? satisfaction as a ?hygiene,? and value as a ?bivalent? factor in consumer loyalty mechanisms. Using consumer data on relational exchanges in two different service contexts?retail clothing and nonbusiness airline travel?and accounting for different sources of error?namely, measurement, common method, and response style?the authors empirically investigate the hypothesized mechanisms. The data support the motivator, or the enhancing role of trust, and the hygiene, or the maintaining role of satisfaction, on loyalty intentions in both contexts. Although the authors also obtain consistent results for the influence of value, its role is aligned with a hygiene mechanism, not a bivalent mechanism. The authors contribute to the study of loyalty antecedents by (1) theoretically proposing the nature and shape of the influence of different loyalty determinants, (2) considering the simultaneous and differential effects of multiple determinants, and (3) drawing implications from the results for theory and managerial practice.",1
Intrafunctional Competitive Intelligence and Sales Performance: A Social Network Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Salespeople represent a primary source of competitive intelligence (CI), but the contextual factors that influence the performance impact of salesperson CI quality remain underresearched. The authors develop a framework to examine the performance impact of CI quality at the individual salesperson and sales district levels, with sales district CI quality diversity and sales managers' network centrality as contingencies thereof. The empirical results from multilevel data sets of two U.S.-based corporations reveal that district CI quality diversity weakens the positive performance effect of CI quality at both levels. Sales managers' centrality in within-district and peer advice networks buffers the performance losses created by district CI quality diversity, but salespeople's centrality does not have this buffering effect. The study uncovers conditions under which the positive performance impact of salesperson and district CI quality can disappear and even become negative, thus highlighting the role of managers as CI hubs.",0
Why Are Some Salespeople Better at Adapting to Organizational Change?,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This study empirically examines the longitudinal influences of salesperson goal orientations on performance trajectories during a planned change intervention that requires learning to answer two questions. First, what is the functional form of salespeople's performance trajectories during a period of change implementation? Second, why are some salespeople better at adapting to change than others? Polynomial growth models show that the average salesperson performance trajectory displays an initial decline, gradual recovery, and eventual restabilization. Salesperson learning orientation is related positively to larger initial declines, steeper recovery slopes, and higher restabilization levels. In contrast, performance orientation is related positively to smaller initial declines, but shallower recovery slopes and lower restabilization levels. The results suggest that successful implementation of planned change interventions largely depends on identifying and appreciating the heterogeneity of individual traits that share meaning with the change. The study has implications on what sales managers should expect in terms of performance losses and gains during change and how managers can predict which salespeople will reap the largest performance benefits from a change intervention.",0
The Role of Consensus in Sales Team Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Although team-based selling is highly prominent in practice, research on the drivers of its effectiveness is sparse. Drawing from the literature on climate consensus, the authors propose that in addition to leadership and team factors, team consensus plays a critical role in boosting sales team effectiveness. Using survey and archival data from a sample of 185 pharmaceutical sales teams, the authors find that high team consensus regarding team-level leadership empowerment behaviors (LEBs) and team interpersonal climate quality enhances team potency given high LEBs but weakens team potency given low LEBs. In turn, team potency translates into sales team performance through both extra-role (team helping behavior) and in-role (team effort) behavior. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.",1
Managing Sales Force Product Perceptions and Control Systemsinthe Success of New Product Introductions,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Given the importance of new products, firms may be prone to overmanage sales personnel by using behavior-based control systems that dictate the performance of particular activities related to the introduction. Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales.",1
International Market Entry: How Do Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Make Decisions?,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Choosing the right international market entry mode is of utmost importance for an internationalizing firm. However, there is a lack of analysis concerning the decision-making process (DMP), specifically with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors study the DMP among SMEs intent on entering international markets and how it affects each firm's international market development strategy. Using six cases based in Finland and Italy, the authors develop a model of the SME DMP. Their results imply that the DMP evolves and goes through various phases. By focusing on the postentry phase, this study enhances knowledge on decision-making frameworks by linking the traditional international marketing literature related to initial entry mode with ?mainstream? international business literature. Furthermore, the study reveals that SMEs adopting a more rational DMP are more likely to succeed in foreign markets, and consequently, it demonstrates the importance of real options reasoning as a theoretical lens for making entry mode decisions in the context of SMEs.",0
How Far Can a Brand Stretch? Understanding the Role of Self-Construal,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"A brand's stretchability is an important avenue for growth and new product introductions. This research examines the role of an individual-difference variable (self-construal) in enhancing a brand's stretchability potential. It is postulated that an interdependent self-construal leads to a superior ability to uncover relationships among stimuli (e.g., an extension and its parent brand) and thus is likely to enhance the perceived fit of an extension and the likelihood of its acceptance. However, these beneficial effects are likely to emerge only under conditions in which the interdependent consumer is motivated to elaborate extensively on the extension information. Five experiments test the underlying mechanism, its implications for different levels of brand stretch (varying from close to far), and the marketing strategy implications of the proposed theoretical framework.",1
Consumer Response to Negative Publicity: The Moderating Role of Commitment,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Even though negative information about brands and companies is widely prevalent in the marketplace, except for case studies, there has been no systematic investigation of how consumers process negative information about the brands they like and use. In the three studies in this research, the authors attempt to bridge this gap. The findings of the first and second studies provide a theoretical framework for understanding how consumers process negative information in the marketplace. Commitment of the consumer toward the brand is identified as a moderator of negative information effects. In the third study, the authors use this theoretical framework to derive and test response strategies that companies can use to counter negative publicity for consumers who are high and low in commitment toward the brand.",1
The Moderating Role of Commitment on the Spillover Effect of Marketing Communications,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Spillover refers to the extent to which a message influences beliefs related to attributes that are not contained in the message. The authors find that when consumers are not familiar with a brand, negative information spills over to attributes that are associated with the target attribute but not mentioned in the message. However, positive information does not. When consumers like the brand, a spillover occurs for the positive information as well. When consumers are committed to the brand, the spillover of negative information is minimized, but positive information spills over more freely to other associated but unmentioned attributes.",1
When It Pays to Wait: Optimizing Release Timing Decisions for Secondary Channels in the Film Industry,Journal of Marketing,2016,"This study examines the optimization of interrelease timing decisions, focusing on box office and DVD sales in the U.S. motion picture industry. It aims to improve managerial decision making by jointly modeling the revenue in these two channels through a copula modeling approach. As in previous studies, the authors find that the time lag from box office release to DVD release should be increased to optimize total movie performance, but they conclude that previous studies have systematically underestimated the optimal time lag. This study is the first to challenge the assumption of a negative decay in DVD performance as a function of time; its results suggest that a delayed DVD release is still optimal for maximizing revenue in the DVD channel. This study's model suggests that, on average, individual movies are approximately eight weeks away from their optimal lag and that the net impact of optimizing would be improvements in total and DVD revenue by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Therefore, this model is expected to enhance managerial decision making by offering the ability to predict the optimal time lag for individual movies.",0
Decomposition of the Sales Impact of Promotion-Induced Stockpiling,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Promotion-induced consumer stockpiling has a negative impact on manufacturers because it moves forward in time brand sales that would have occurred later at full margin. However, the resultant increase in consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article, the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes. They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an increase in repeat purchases. These benefits easily offset the negative aspect of consumer stockpiling?namely, purchase acceleration by loyal customers who would have bought the brand at regular price at a later date.",1
An Empirical Analysis of the Determinants of Retail Margins: The Role of Store-Brand Share,Journal of Marketing,2004,"The authors develop and test a model of the key determinants of margins that retailers earn on national brands and store brands. They particularly focus on the impact of store-brand share on percentage margin, dollar margin per unit, and total dollar margin of the retailer. The authors find not only that percentage retail margins on store brands are higher than on national brands but also that high store-brand share enables retailers to earn higher percentage margins on national brands. However, the dollar margin per unit may be smaller for store brands because of their lower retail price. Furthermore, heavy store-brand users contribute much less to the total dollar profit of the retailer than do light store-brand users. The authors conclude that it is important for retailers to retain a balance between store brands and national brands to attract and retain the most profitable customers.",0
"Promotion Profitability for a Retailer: The Role of Promotion, Brand, Category, and Store Characteristics",Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The purpose of this article is to quantify the net unit and net profit impact of promotions for a retailer and to understand the key correlates of this impact. Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit impact. Deep, featured promotions on high ?consumer-pull? brands generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact. Therefore, the retailer must make some difficult trade-offs between revenue and profit objectives in promotion decisions.",1
Market Response to a Major Policy Change in the Marketing Mix: Learning from Procter & Gamble's Value Pricing Strategy,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Much research has focused on how consumers and competitors respond to short-term changes in advertising and promotion. In contrast, the authors use Procter & Gamble's (P&G's) value pricing strategy as an opportunity to study consumer and competitor response to a major, sustained change in marketing-mix strategy. They compile data across 24 categories in which P&G has a significant market share, covering the period from 1990 to 1996, during which P&G instituted major cuts in deals and coupons and substantial increases in advertising. The authors estimate an econometric model to trace how consumers and competitors react to such changes. For the average brand, the authors find that deals and coupons increase market penetration and surprisingly have little impact on customer retention as measured by share-of-category requirements and category usage. For the average brand, advertising works primarily by increasing penetration, but its effect is weaker than that of promotion. The authors find that competitor response is related to how strongly the competitor's market share is affected by the change in marketing mix and the competitor's own response and to structural factors such as market share position and multi-market contact. The net impact of these consumer and competitor responses is a decrease in market share for the company that institutes sustained decreases in promotion coupled with increases in advertising.",0
Revenue Premium as an Outcome Measure of Brand Equity,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors propose that the revenue premium a brand generates compared with that of a private label product is a simple, objective, and managerially useful product-market measure of brand equity. The authors provide the conceptual basis for the measure, compute it for brands in several packaged goods categories, and test its validity. The empirical analysis shows that the measure is reliable and reflects real changes in brand health over time. It correlates well with other equity measures, and the measure's association with a brand's advertising and promotion activity, price sensitivity, and perceived category risk is consistent with theory.",0
The Club Store Effect: Impact of Shopping in Warehouse Club Stores on Consumers' Packaged Food Purchases,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This article studies the impact of shopping at the warehouse club format on households' purchases of packaged food for the home. In addition to low prices, this format has several unique characteristics that can influence packaged food purchases. The empirical analysis uses a combination of households' longitudinal grocery purchase information, rich survey data, and detailed item-level nutrition information. After accounting for selection on observables and unobservables, the authors find a substantial increase in the total quantity (servings per capita) of packaged food purchases attributable to shopping at this format. Because there is no effect on the nutritional quality of purchases, this translates into a substantial increase in calories, sugar, and saturated fat per capita. The increase comes primarily from storable and impulse foods, and it is drawn equally from foods that have positive and negative health halos. The results have important implications for how marketers can create win?win opportunities for themselves and for consumers.",1
Pursuing the Value-Conscious Consumer: Store Brands versus National Brand Promotions,Journal of Marketing,2001,"The objective of this article is to determine whether national brand promotions and store brands attract the same value-conscious consumers, which would aggravate channel conflict between manufacturers and retailers. The authors identify psychographic and demographic traits that potentially drive usage of store brands and national brand promotions. They then develop a framework and structural equation model to study the association of these traits with store brand and national brand promotion usage. The authors find that though demographics do not influence these behaviors directly, they have significant associations with psychographic characteristics and therefore are useful for market targeting. Most important, usage of store brands and usage of promotions, particularly out-of-store promotions, are associated with different psychographics. Store brand use correlates mainly with traits related to economic benefits and costs, whereas the use of out-of-store promotions is associated mainly with traits related to hedonic benefits and costs. These differences result in four well-defined and identifiable consumer segments: deal-focused consumers, store brand?focused consumers, deal and store brand users (use-all), and nonusers of both store brands and deals (use-none). Therefore, manufacturers and retailers have the opportunity to either avoid each other or compete head to head, depending on which segment they target.",0
Private-Label Use and Store Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors develop an econometric model of the relationship between a household's private-label (PL) share and its behavioral store loyalty. The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them. The model is estimated with a unique data set that combines complete purchase records of a panel of Dutch households with demographic and psychographic data. The authors estimate the model for two retail chains in the Netherlands?the leading service chain with a well-differentiated high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough levels. The managerial implications of this research are important. Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general, not to the PL of any particular chain.",0
When Wal-Mart Enters: How Incumbent Retailers React and how this Affects their Sales Outcomes,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors examine incumbent retailers' reactions to a Wal-Mart entry and the impact of these reactions on the retailers' sales. They compile a unique data set that consists of incumbent supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers in the vicinity of seven Wal-Mart entries, as well as control stores not exposed to the entries. The data set includes weekly store movement data for 46 product categories before and after each entry and allows the authors to measure reactions and sales outcomes using a before-and-after-with-control-group analysis. They find that, overall, incumbents suffer significant sales losses as a result of a Wal-Mart entry, but there is substantial variation across retail formats, stores, and categories both in incumbent reactions and in their sales outcomes. Moreover, they find that a retailer's sales outcomes are significantly affected by its reactions, and the relationship between reactions and sales outcomes varies across retail formats. These findings provide valuable insights into how retailers in different formats can adjust their marketing mix to mitigate the impact of a Wal-Mart entry.",1
The Complexity of Context: A Service Ecosystems Approach for International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"To strengthen the theoretical foundations of international marketing (IM), the authors propose a framework for conceptualizing the complexity of the context that frames international and global exchange systems. In particular, they apply a service ecosystems approach, which is grounded in service-dominant logic and its foundational premise that service is the basis of all exchange. The proposed framework provides insight into the nature of context, a distinguishing feature of IM. The authors argue that the embeddedness of social networks and the multiplicity of institutions within a service ecosystem influence the complexity of context. They articulate the way the (co)creation of value influences and is influenced by the enactment of practices and the integration of resources through various levels (micro, meso, and macro) of interaction and institutions. They introduce the concept of ?value in cultural context? to emphasize the influence of the symbolic and social components of context. The article concludes with a discussion of the research implications for how a service ecosystems view can aid in the advancement of IM theory and practice.",0
Valuable Virality,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Given recent interest in social media, many brands now create content that they hope consumers will view and share with peers. While some campaigns indeed go ?viral,? their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors? framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality and the mechanisms underlying these effects.",1
The Long-Term Stock Market Valuation of Customer Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Firm valuation has been an important domain of interest for finance. However, most financial models do not include customer-related metrics in this process. Studies in marketing have found that one particular customer metric, customer satisfaction, improves the ability to predict future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and shareholder value. However, most of these studies predominantly employ models that are not directly used in finance practice. This article extends existing literature by examining the impact of customer satisfaction on firm valuation by employing multiples and risk-adjusted abnormal return models borrowed directly from the practice of finance. Data include 3600 firm-quarter observations from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, COMPUSTAT, and Center for Research in Securities Prices databases from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that a portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive changes in customer satisfaction will outperform the other three possible portfolio combinations (low levels and negative changes, low levels and positive changes, and high levels and negative changes in customer satisfaction) along with Standard & Poor's 500. Initially, the stock market undervalues positive satisfaction information, but the market adjusts in the long run.",0
On the Competitive and Collaborative Implications of Category Captainship,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Category captainship (CC) is a retailing practice wherein a retailer collaborates with one of the manufacturers in a product category (referred to as the captain) to develop and implement a category management strategy. Although CC has been studied using both theoretical models and surveys, empirical evidence on the benefits and drawbacks of CC is scarce. The authors use a unique data set collected during a CC implementation to empirically examine the impact of CC on the retailer, the captain, and the other manufacturers in the category. The authors find that both the retailer's private label and the captain benefit from CC because of pricing and assortment changes. They also find that some competing manufacturers benefit from CC while others suffer. Specifically, the manufacturers that closely compete with the captain benefit, whereas the manufacturers that are in close competition with the private label suffer because the retailer protects its private label. The authors show that category sales would have been higher if the retailer had not protected its private label. This study sheds light on how joint consideration of assortment and pricing, the presence of a private label, and product characteristics may influence the outcomes of CC implementations.",0
Gambled Price Discounts: A Remedy to the Negative Side Effects of Regular Price Discounts,Journal of Marketing,2015,"In the context of price discounts, a special type of price promotion, in which savings depend on the outcome of a gamble and are thus uncertain, has recently achieved some popularity. The question arises as to whether such gambled price discounts (GPDs) incur the negative reference price effect?that is, a downward shift in customers? internal reference price (IRP)?which is often associated with regular price discounts (RPDs). From several studies, including two longitudinal field experiments, the authors find that GPDs indeed alleviate the negative reference price effect: IRPs and actual repurchasing tend to be lower for RPDs than for GPDs and a no-discount control condition. Moreover, the authors explore the psychological underpinnings of these effects and show that the different consequences of GPDs versus RPDs on IRPs are more pronounced if information regarding product quality is limited. The authors demonstrate that findings are robust to variations of GPD discount levels and the probability of winning.",0
"Adaptation of International Marketing Strategy Components, Competitive Advantage, and Firm Performance: A Study of Hong Kong Exporters",Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The authors examine how firms adapt different components of their marketing strategies in foreign markets compared with their domestic market and how such adaptation decisions influence the firms' competitive positions and performance in foreign markets. The authors conceptualize that adaptation of a marketing-mix component is a purposeful process that is influenced by a firm's past adaptation strategy, and they investigate the importance of that marketing-mix component to the firm's success. The authors propose that the adaptation process helps define a firm's competitive advantage, which in turn affects its performance in the foreign market. The authors develop hypotheses and propositions and test them with a sample of 183 export firms in Hong Kong.",0
Personal Selling Elasticities: A Meta-Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article presents a meta-analysis of prior econometric estimates of personal selling elasticity?that is, the ratio of the percentage change in an objective, ratio-scaled measure of sales output (e.g., dollar or unit purchases) to the corresponding percentage change in an objective, ratio-scaled measure of personal selling input (e.g., dollar expenditures). The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 506 personal selling elasticity estimates drawn from analyses of 88 empirical data sets across 75 previous articles. They find a mean estimate of current-period personal selling elasticity of .34. They also find that elasticity estimates are higher for early life-cycle-stage offerings, higher from studies set in Europe than from those set in the United States, and smaller in more recent years. In addition, elasticity estimates are affected significantly by analysts? use of relative rather than absolute sales output measures, by cross-sectional rather than panel data, by omission of promotions, by lagged effects, by marketing interaction effects, and by the neglect of endogeneity in model estimation. The method bias?corrected mean personal selling elasticity is approximately .31. The authors discuss the implications of their results for sales managers and researchers.",1
The Effect of Global Company Animosity on Global Brand Attitudes in Emerging and Developed Markets: Does Perceived Value Matter?,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Country-level animosity effects on foreign products from disliked countries are fairly well understood, but little is known about the role of global company animosity (GCA). Such understanding is important in a world increasingly dominated by global brands that are rapidly losing their associations with individual countries. This study proposes a nomological net that features GCA and perceived value of global brands (PVGB) as ?dual process antecedents? to global brand attitudes and mediators of four relevant exogenous constructs (consumer ethnocentrism and localism through GCA and cosmopolitanism and materialism through PVGB). Using nonstudent consumers, the authors test the model in three diverse national markets ranging from emerging to developed: Brazil, South Korea, and Germany. The results show support for the importance of PVGB as a counterbalance to GCA in Brazil and Germany. The dominance of the PVGB path in South Korea is due to the country's unique socioeconomic milieu. Although replication is warranted, international marketing managers should benefit from strategic consideration of the antecedents and pathways from GCA and PVGB to global brand attitudes.",0
As Time Goes By: Do Cold Feet Follow Warm Intentions for Really New versus Incrementally New Products?,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Combining prior theory about really new products (RNPs) with temporal construal theory, the authors show in four field studies that consumers follow through less often on positive purchase intentions to buy RNPs than on intentions to buy incrementally new products (INPs), and the decrement grows over time. Compared with consumers of INPs, consumers of RNPs are less likely to think concretely about the circumstances of buying and using the products and are more poorly calibrated in their expectations of initial product use. The authors discuss implications for both the marketing of and the market research on RNPs.",1
The Social Influence of Brand Community: Evidence from European Car Clubs,Journal of Marketing,2005,"The authors develop and estimate a conceptual model of how different aspects of customers? relationships with the brand community influence their intentions and behaviors. The authors describe how identification with the brand community leads to positive consequences, such as greater community engagement, and negative consequences, such as normative community pressure and (ultimately) reactance. They examine the moderating effects of customers? brand knowledge and the brand community's size and test their hypotheses by estimating a structural equation model with survey data from a sample of European car club members.",0
"Negative Reviews, Positive Impact: Consumer Empathetic Responding to Unfair Word of Mouth",Journal of Marketing,2020,"This research documents how negative reviews, when perceived as unfair, can activate feelings of empathy toward firms that have been wronged. Six studies and four supplemental experiments provide converging evidence that this experienced empathy for the firm motivates supportive consumer responses such as paying higher purchase prices and reporting increased patronage intentions. Importantly, this research highlights factors that can increase or decrease empathy toward a firm. For instance, adopting the reviewer?s perspective when evaluating an unfair negative review can reduce positive consumer responses to a firm, whereas conditions that enhance the ability to experience empathy?such as when reviews are highly unfair, when the identity of the employee is made salient, or when the firm responds in an empathetic manner?can result in positive consumer responses toward the firm. Overall, this work extends the understanding of consumers? responses to word of mouth in the marketplace by highlighting the role of perceived (un)fairness. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for better management of consumer reviews.",0
Comparative Price and the Design of Effective Product Communications,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The authors propose a model relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers? response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low- and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the ?match? between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans. By emphasizing the link between comparative price and the matching level of construal, the authors contribute to a richer view of the interplay between price and product communication in marketing.",0
When ?More? Seems Like Less: Differential Price Framing Increases the Choice Share of Higher-Priced Options,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Four experiments supported by six supplemental studies show that premium but higher-priced products (e.g., direct flights, larger-capacity data storage devices) are more popular when the additional cost is made explicit using differential price framing (DPF; e.g., ?for $20 more?) rather than being left implicit, as in standard inclusive price framing (IPF; e.g., ?for $60 total?). The DPF effect is driven by pricing focalism: relative to IPF, DPF creates a focus on the price difference, which, because it is smaller than the total price, leads to lower perceived expensiveness and thus greater choice share for the premium option. This price framing effect is robust to displaying the total cost of the purchase, bad deals, and easy-to-compute price differences, and it appears to be uniquely effective in pricing contexts. However, DPF effects are reduced among consumers who adopt a slow and effortful decision process. These findings have implications for research on price partitioning, the design of effective pricing strategy, the sources of expensiveness perceptions in the marketplace, and consumer welfare.",1
How Deviations from Performance Norms Impact Charitable Donations,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Although the actions of others can influence a consumer's behavior, these actions are often at odds with performance norms. For example, charities can experience relatively low rates of support (resulting in a negative deviation from a performance norm) or relatively high rates of support (resulting in a positive deviation from a performance norm). Previous research provides evidence of the equivocal effects of these deviations, with both positive and negative deviations motivating prosocial behaviors. The current research reconciles these competing findings by introducing construal as a moderator. Across four studies, the authors find that positive deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for independent donors, whereas negative deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for interdependent donors. They further show that these effects are driven by a prevention focus associated with interdependent consumers and a promotion focus associated with independent consumers. The article concludes with implications for the marketing of charities and prosocial behaviors.",1
Design Crowdsourcing: The Impact on New Product Performance of Sourcing Design Solutions from the ?Crowd?,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The authors examine an increasingly popular open innovation practice, ?design crowdsourcing,? wherein firms seek external inputs in the form of functional design solutions for new product development from the ?crowd.? They investigate conditions under which managers crowdsource design and determine whether such decisions subsequently boost product sales. The empirical analysis is guided by qualitative insights gathered from executive interviews. The authors use a novel data set from a pioneering crowdsourcing firm and find that three concept design characteristics?perceived usability, reliability, and technical complexity?are associated with the decision to crowdsource design. They use an instrumental variable method accounting for the endogenous nature of crowdsourcing decisions to understand when such a decision affects downstream sales. The authors find that design crowdsourcing is positively related to unit sales and that this effect is moderated by the idea quality of the initial product concept. Using a change-score analysis of consumer ratings, they find that design crowdsourcing enhances perceived reliability and usability. They discuss the strategic implications of involving the crowd, beyond ideation, in helping transform ideas into effective products.",0
"Brand Image Evaluations: The Interactive Roles of Country of Manufacture, Brand Concept, and Vertical Line Extension Type",Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Country-of-origin research has provided inconsistent findings about how the country of manufacture (COM) affects brand image evaluations. The authors examine how the COM, vertical line extension (VLE) type, and brand concept interactively affect brand image evaluations after brands introduce products in their existing product categories. The authors draw on schema congruity theory to develop a conceptual framework and confirm it using experimental methods. Results from a sample of U.S. consumers demonstrate that the COM's influence on brand image should be considered in conjunction with the type of VLE strategy and the intended conceptual meaning of a brand. Manufacturing in a country with a favorable image does not always improve brand image evaluations. Functional brands can improve their image with an upward VLE regardless of the COM; however, if these brands pursue a downward VLE, the COM has little to no effect. For prestige brands, downward VLEs result in lower postextension brand image regardless of the COM. However, a favorable COM appears to soften the negative effect of downward VLE on postextension brand image evaluations.",0
Understanding Cultural Differences in Consumers? Reactions to Foreign-Market Brand Extensions: The Role of Thinking Styles,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"One popular strategy for brands to grow outside of their home markets is to use line extensions. Although extensive research has examined how factors such as culture influence product acceptance across markets, far less is known regarding how such factors influence parent brand perceptions in response to an extension. This article investigates the role of one aspect of culture, consumers? thinking styles, in terms of postextension parent brand spillover effects, and considers potential implications for firms? global brand strategies, including the extension?s direction (upward or downward) and parent brand concept (functional or prestige). Through two studies, one using consumer panels in the United States and India and the other set in the United States, the authors examine consumer-level differences by measuring thinking styles. Results based on both studies indicate that vertical line extension type affects analytic thinkers? reactions more than those of holistic thinkers, and parent brand image benefits (suffers) when a vertical line extension is for a functional (prestige) brand, regardless of consumers? thinking style. The authors find interesting differences in the role of thinking styles based on the particular dimension examined.",0
Executive Insights: Franchising Opportunities and Threats in Russia,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"This article pertains to franchising in Russia, a post-Communist economy with one of the largest market potentials for American business. The authors focus on the environmental factors associated with international franchising in Russia and examine the four Ps and the entry strategies available to prospective franchisors, which provides the background for a franchising marketing plan. In addition, this research provides rules of thumb to potential market entrants into Russia.",0
"Product Variety, Informative Advertising, and Price Competition",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"In many product categories, consumer tastes are diverse, and firms use finely targeted advertising to inform consumers about their products. This article proposes a model of informative advertising that allows for diverse consumer tastes and multiple competing firms. Using this framework, the authors analyze how diversity in consumers? tastes, informative advertising, and improvements in advertising technology may influence prices. First, informative advertising can lead to lower prices if consumer valuations are high. However, if consumer valuations are low, informative advertising can lead to higher prices. Second, when consumer valuations are high, price increases with greater diversity in tastes, though this result reverses if consumer valuations are low. Third, improvements in advertising technology lead to higher levels of advertising when consumer valuation is high, but the opposite effect can occur when consumer valuation is low. The authors relate these theoretical findings to previous empirical literature on advertising.",1
The Charm of Behavior-Based Pricing: When Consumers? Taste Is Diverse and the Consideration Set Is Limited,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Technology is making it easier for firms to track consumers? purchase history and leverage the information when setting prices. This article explores the practice of behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers? taste is diverse and the consideration set is limited. The analysis identifies a novel mechanism that can help firms earn more profits with BBP than without it. Prior research shows that BBP intensifies price competition for new consumers. The authors show that if consumer valuation is low, the lower price can help expand sales to consumers for whom only the second preferred product is available, and the resulting increase in revenue more than offsets the loss in revenue because of the intensified price competition. The opposite result occurs if product valuation is high. Moreover, the difference in the price charged for old and new consumers under BBP decreases with the diversity in consumers? taste if consumer valuation is low. The result, however, is reversed if consumer valuation is high.",1
Pricing of Conspicuous Goods: A Competitive Analysis of Social Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Social needs play an important role in the purchase of conspicuous goods. In this article, the authors extend traditional economic models to accommodate social needs, such as desire for uniqueness and conformism, and examine their implications for pricing conspicuous goods. First, in the context of a duopoly, the authors identify the conditions under which the desire for uniqueness can increase demand among some consumers as the price of a product increases. Second, the authors show that though the desire for uniqueness leads to higher prices and firm profits, a desire for conformity leads to lower prices and profits. Third, the authors find that consumers purchase high-quality products not because of their desire for uniqueness but despite it. Finally, marketers of conspicuous goods may find it beneficial not to emphasize the functional differences among their products when the need for uniqueness is high. In a laboratory test, the authors find support for the claim that demand for a product among consumers who desire uniqueness may increase as its price increases.",1
Multitier Store Brands and Channel Profits,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Multitier store brands are increasing in significance in retail outlets. In this article, the authors theoretically examine the rationale for the existence of multitier store brands, their optimal quality levels, and their implications for consumer welfare and channel profits. They show that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium. Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease consumer welfare or channel profits. However, store brands hurt the manufacturer's profits and make two-part tariffs ineffective in improving channel coordination. Nonetheless, the retailer can enhance channel coordination by procuring the store brand from the national brand manufacturer. The authors extend their model in several directions to capture additional features of retail markets and assess the robustness of their findings.",1
Winning the Battle but Losing the War: The Psychology of Debt Management,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"When consumers carry multiple debts, how do they decide which debt to repay first? Normatively, consumers should repay the debt with the highest interest rate most quickly. However, because people tend to break complicated tasks into more manageable parts, and because losses are most distressing when segregated, the authors hypothesize that people will pay off the smallest loan first to reduce the total number of outstanding loans and achieve a sense of tangible progress toward debt repayment. To experimentally examine how consumers manage multiple debts, the authors develop an incentive-compatible debt management game, in which participants are saddled with multiple debts and need to decide how to repay them over time. Consistent with the hypothesis, four experiments reveal evidence of debt account aversion: Participants consistently pay off small debts first, even though the larger debts have higher interest rates. The authors also find that restricting participants? ability to completely pay off small debts, and focusing their attention on the amount of interest each debt has accumulated, helps them reduce overall debt more quickly.",1
"Maximizing Profitability and Return on Investment: A Short Clarification on Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar",Journal of Marketing,2005,"Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar (2005) provide a valuable methodology for balancing resources between customer retention and acquisition. They also conclude that optimal profitability (net return) coincides with optimal return on investment. This article clarifies this perhaps surprising conclusion and shows that it arises from the authors' methodology rather than from the data. More conventional analysis of the same data indicates that maximum return on investment is reached with lower expenditure than maximum profitability.",0
"Executive Insights: Exploring the Practical Effects of Country of Origin, Animosity, and Price?Quality Issues: Two Case Studies of Taiwan and Acer in China",Journal of International Marketing,2005,"The authors review relevant literature and present two new case studies?one of Taiwan's country image campaign and the other of Acer's entry into global markets?to gain a further understanding of two related constructs, country of origin (from the field of international marketing) and animosity (from the field of consumer behavior). The authors formulate four research propositions and discuss them in reference to the two case studies. They show how the Taiwanese government has used various marketing and advertising strategies to create a positive country image and how Acer has mitigated negative country-of-origin effects and animosity in world markets, especially in China.",0
Decisions by Rules: The Case of Unwillingness to Pay for Beneficial Delays,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Since the emergence of neoclassical economics, individual decision making has been viewed largely from an outcome-maximizing perspective. Building on previous work, the authors suggest that when people make payment decisions, they consider not only their preferences for different alternatives but also guiding principles and behavioral rules. The authors describe and test two characteristics pertaining to one specific rule that dictates that consumers should not pay for delays, even if they are beneficial: rule invocation and rule override. The results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule, that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem but can be overridden. The article concludes with a discussion of more general applications of such rules, which may explain some of the seemingly systematic inconsistencies in the ways consumers behave.",1
Choice Construction versus Preference Construction: The Instability of Preferences Learned in Context,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Preference consistency implies that people have learned their willingness to trade off attributes. The authors argue that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, they show that when people learn preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy), they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The authors show that this ?preference? might just be a learned solution to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers' preferences.",1
Brands as Beacons: A New Source of Loyalty to Multiproduct Firms,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"This study provides evidence that a multiproduct firm's portfolio of products affects consumer purchase decisions about each of the firm's products. The authors present a theory that explains this empirical regularity. The theory involves revising the information set of consumers to include the profile of multiproduct firms. The authors show that revision of the information set in this way introduces a new source of consumer loyalty and explains interesting empirical regularities in consumer behavior. For example, consumers are loyal to a multiproduct firm even when it does not offer a product that matches their preferences better than a product of competing firms. The authors estimate the model and test its implications using panel data on television viewing choices. The estimated model also allows for state-dependence parameters and unobserved heterogeneity. The empirical results support the model and its implications. The model offers a parsimonious framework for brand-extension strategies and maps new channels of spillovers in a multiproduct firm.",1
Factors Influencing Customer Trust in Salespersons in a Developing Country,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Research on trust is limited in the context of developing countries. Because of its importance in facilitating exchange, this study attempts to assess the determinants of customer trust in salespersons in a developing country. The theoretical model was derived from research conducted in the developed countries. Survey results indicate that salesperson attributes such as expertise, intent, and likability influenced customer trust in salespeople. Confidence in the organization represented by the salesperson also had a significant effect on customer trust. Customers? product knowledge did not influence their trust in salespeople. However, customers? generalized disposition to trust others did.",0
Harbingers of Failure,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors identify customers, termed ?Harbingers of failure,? who systematically purchase new products that flop. Their early adoption of a new product is a strong signal that a product will fail?the more they buy, the less likely the product will succeed. Firms can identify these customers through past purchases of either new products that failed or existing products that few other customers purchase. The authors discuss how these insights can be readily incorporated into the new product development process. The findings challenge the conventional wisdom that positive customer feedback is always a signal of future success.",1
How Sales Taxes Affect Customer and Firm Behavior: The Role of Search on the Internet,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"When a multichannel retailer opens its first retail store in a state, the firm is obligated to collect sales taxes on all Internet and catalog orders shipped to that state. This article assesses how opening a store affects Internet and catalog demand. The authors analyze purchase behavior among customers who live far from the retail store but must now pay sales taxes on catalog and Internet purchases. A comparable group of customers in a neighboring state serves as a control. The results show that Internet sales decrease significantly, but catalog sales are unaffected. Further investigation indicates that the difference in these outcomes is partly attributable to the ease with which customers can search for lower prices at competing retailers. The authors extend the analysis to a panel of multichannel firms and show that retailers that earn a large proportion of their revenue from direct channels avoid opening a first store in high-tax states. They conclude that current U.S. sales taxes laws have significant effects on both customer and firm behavior.",1
"Advertising in a Competitive Market: The Role of Product Standards, Customer Learning, and Switching Costs",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Standard models of competition predict that firms will sell less when competitors target their customers with advertising. This is particularly true in mature markets with many competitors that sell relatively undifferentiated products. However, the authors present findings from a large-scale randomized field experiment that contrast sharply with this prediction. The field experiment measures the impact of competitors' advertising on sales at a private label apparel retailer. Surprisingly, for a substantial segment of customers, the competitors' advertisements increased sales at this retailer. This robust effect was obtained through experimental manipulation and by measuring actual purchases from large samples of randomly assigned customers. The effect size is also large, with customers ordering more than 4% more items in some categories in the treatment condition (vs. the control). The authors examine how these positive spillovers vary across product categories to illustrate the importance of product standards, customer learning, and switching costs. The findings have the potential to change our understanding of competition in mature markets.",1
"Reviews without a Purchase: Low Ratings, Loyal Customers, and Deception",Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors document that approximately 5% of product reviews on a large private label retailer's website are submitted by customers with no record of ever purchasing the product they are reviewing. These reviews are significantly more negative than other reviews. They are also less likely to contain expressions describing the fit or feel of the items and more likely to contain linguistic cues associated with deception. More than 12,000 of the firm's best customers have written reviews without confirmed transactions. On average, these customers have each made more than 150 purchases from the firm. This makes it unlikely that the reviews were written by the employees or agents of a competitor and suggests that deceptive reviews may not be limited to the strategic actions of firms. Instead, the phenomenon may be far more prevalent, extending to individual customers who have no financial incentive to influence product ratings.",1
Coordinating Price Reductions and Coupon Events,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In this article, the authors use an economic model to show that it may be optimal to lower the retail price during a coupon event when marginal consumers have moderate hassle costs of coupon redemption. Results from the model offer predictions on the relationships among coupon redemptions, shelf price, and coupon face value. The authors test these predictions on a large data set of hundreds of coupon events across six packaged goods categories. The data show that when a small coupon face value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory. When a firm moves from uniform pricing (e.g., no coupons) to second-degree price discrimination (e.g., coupons), all consumers may face a lower price. This finding has public policy implications because second-degree price discrimination may increase the welfare of every consumer.",1
Customer Satisfaction and Shareholder Value,Journal of Marketing,2004,"In this article, the authors develop a theoretical framework that specifies how customer satisfaction affects future customer behavior and, in turn, the level, timing, and risk of future cash flows. Empirically, they find a positive association between customer satisfaction and shareholder value. They also find significant variation in the association across industries and firms.",0
Does Customer Satisfaction Matter to Investors? Findings from the Bond Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article examines whether customer satisfaction is associated with key metrics from corporate bond markets?namely, credit ratings and cost of debt financing. The authors draw on theory in marketing and finance to predict how customer satisfaction should be associated with both measures. To test the hypotheses, they employ the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) database of more than 150 publicly traded firms during the period from 1994 to 2004. The empirical work controls for factors that are known to influence the bond market, such as firm profitability and risk, as well as potential unobservable factors. The findings indicate that firms with lower customer satisfaction exhibit lower credit ratings and higher debt costs?financial consequences of customer satisfaction not previously observed. The results also suggest that the association between ACSI and cost of debt is attenuated by the inherent level of risk faced by the firm.",1
Planned versus Actual Betting in Sequential Gambles,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Anecdotal evidence indicates that in a gambling environment, consumers may end up betting more than they had initially planned. The authors assess this phenomenon in a series of three experiments, in which people are exposed to sequential and fair gambles in a two-stage process (planned and actual bets). The results show that in the planning phase, people behave conservatively, betting on average less after an anticipated loss and the same amount after an anticipated gain. However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble, the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual phase of the gamble.",1
"Understanding Adolescent Intentions to Smoke: An Examination of Relationships among Social Influence, Prior Trial Behavior, and Antitobacco Campaign Advertising",Journal of Marketing,2004,"Telephone interviews were conducted with more than 900 adolescents aged 12 to 18 as part of a multimillion dollar, statewide, antitobacco advertising campaign. The interviews addressed two primary questions: (1) Do counter-advertising campaign attitudes directly affect antismoking beliefs and intent in a manner similar to those of conventional advertisements? and (2) Can advertising campaign attitudes have a stronger effect on beliefs and intent for adolescents with prior smoking behavior and for adolescents exposed to social influence (i.e., friends, siblings, or adult smoker in the home)? The authors? findings show that advertising campaign attitudes, prior trial behavior, and social influence all directly affect antismoking beliefs and that advertising campaign attitudes interact with prior trial behavior to strengthen antismoking beliefs. The results indicate that attitudes related to the campaign, prior trial behavior, and social influence directly influence intent, and advertising campaign attitudes interact with social influence and prior trial behavior to attenuate adolescent intent to smoke. In addition, the effect of advertising campaign attitudes in attenuating social influence and prior trial behavior effects on adolescent intent to smoke persists even when the authors account for strongly held beliefs about smoking. The authors discuss implications for countermarketing communications and the design and understanding of future antismoking campaigns.",0
How Graphic Visual Health Warnings Affect Young Smokers? Thoughts of Quitting,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Two-thirds of adolescent and young adult smokers become lifetime smokers, and one-half of those lifetime smokers will die from this habit. The authors examine alternative persuasive pathways to thoughts of quitting taken by adolescent and young adult smokers when exposed to graphic visual health warnings on cigarette packages. For adolescent smokers, the authors find that graphic warnings and smoking frequency affect fear, and fear influences negative health beliefs about smoking, ultimately increasing thoughts of quitting. They also find that the graphic warning and a graphic warning ? smoking frequency interaction have incremental effects on quit thoughts beyond the effects of fear and negative health beliefs. Using a longitudinal design with a sample of young adult smokers, the authors find support for many of the adolescent smoker findings, particularly the incremental effects of graphicness and its interaction with smoking frequency. These similar results from diverse samples support the use of graphic visual warnings but suggest that effects are attenuated for those who smoke the most. The authors offer implications for countermarketing programs and public health policy.",1
Cause Marketing Effectiveness and the Moderating Role of Price Discounts,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Can cause marketing (CM) be effective? If so, do price discounts moderate CM effectiveness? Despite the prevalence of linking product sales with donations to charity, field evidence of CM effectiveness is lacking. This is of particular concern for managers who wonder whether the findings of laboratory experiments extend to actual consumer purchases. Using large-scale randomized field experiments with more than 17,000 consumers, this research documents that CM can significantly increase consumer purchases. Notably, the answer to the second question is more complicated. Under the moderating role of price discounts, the impact of CM on sales purchases may follow an inverted U-shaped relationship?that is, strongest when price discounts are moderate rather than deep or absent. Follow-up lab experiments reveal that consumers' warm-glow good feelings from CM represent the underlying process. These findings provide novel insights into the boundary conditions and mechanisms of the sales impact of CM for researchers and managers alike.",0
An Empirical Comparison of Logit Choice Models with Discrete versus Continuous Representations of Heterogeneity,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Currently, there is an important debate about the relative merits of models with discrete and continuous representations of consumer heterogeneity. In a recent JMR study, Andrews, Ansari, and Currim (2002; hereafter AAC) compared metric conjoint analysis models with discrete and continuous representations of heterogeneity and found no differences between the two models with respect to parameter recovery and prediction of ratings for holdout profiles. Models with continuous representations of heterogeneity fit the data better than models with discrete representations of heterogeneity. The goal of the current study is to compare the relative performance of logit choice models with discrete versus continuous representations of heterogeneity in terms of the accuracy of household-level parameters, fit, and forecasting accuracy. To accomplish this goal, the authors conduct an extensive simulation experiment with logit models in a scanner data context, using an experimental design based on AAC and other recent simulation studies. One of the main findings is that models with continuous and discrete representations of heterogeneity recover household-level parameter estimates and predict holdout choices about equally well except when the number of purchases per household is small, in which case the models with continuous representations perform very poorly. As in the AAC study, models with continuous representations of heterogeneity fit the data better.",1
"Hierarchical Bayes versus Finite Mixture Conjoint Analysis Models: A Comparison of Fit, Prediction, and Partworth Recovery",Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"A study conducted by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms (1996) and published in Journal of Marketing Research found that finite mixture (FM) conjoint models had the best overall performance of nine conjoint segmentation methods in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. Since that study, hierarchical Bayes (HB) conjoint analysis methods have been proposed to estimate individual-level partworths and have received much attention in the marketing research literature. However, no study has compared the relative effectiveness of FM and HB conjoint analysis models in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. To conduct such a comparison, the authors employ the simulation methodology proposed by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms with some modification. The authors estimate traditional individual-level conjoint models as well. The authors show that FM and HB models are equally effective in recovering individual-level parameters and predicting ratings of holdout profiles. Two surprising findings are that (1) HB performs well even when partworths come from a mixture of distributions and (2) FM produces good parameter estimates, even at the individual level. The authors show that both models are quite robust to violations of underlying assumptions and that traditional individual-level models overfit the data.",1
A Comparison of Segment Retention Criteria for Finite Mixture Logit Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Despite the widespread application of finite mixture models in marketing research, the decision of how many segments to retain in the models is an important unresolved issue. Almost all applications of the models in marketing rely on segment retention criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, consistent Akaike's information criterion, and information complexity to determine the number of latent segments to retain. Because these applications employ real-world data in which the true number of segments is unknown, it is not clear whether these criteria are effective. Retaining the true number of segments is crucial because many product design and marketing decisions depend on it. The purpose of this extensive simulation study is to determine how well commonly used segment retention criteria perform in the context of simulated multinomial choice data, as obtained from supermarket scanner panels, in which the true number of segments is known. The authors find that an Akaike's information criterion with a penalty factor of three rather than the traditional value of two has the highest segment retention success rate across nearly all experimental conditions. Currently, this criterion is rarely, if ever, applied in the marketing literature. Experimental factors of particular interest in marketing contexts, such as the number of choices per household, the number of choice alternatives, the error variance of the choices, and the minimum segment size, have not been considered in the statistics literature. The authors show that they, among other factors, affect the performance of segment retention criteria.",1
Contingent Match Incentives Increase Donations,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors propose a new means by which nonprofits can induce donors to give today and commit to giving in the future: contingent match incentives, in which matching is made contingent on the percentage of others who give (e.g., ?if X% of others give, we will match all donations?). A field experiment shows that a 75% contingent match (such that matches ?kick in? only if 75% of others donate) is most effective in increasing commitment to recurring donations. An online experiment reveals that the 75% contingent match drives commitment to recurring donations because it simultaneously provides social proof while offering a low enough target to remain plausible that the match will occur. A final online experiment demonstrates that the effectiveness of the 75% contingent match extends to one-time donations. The authors discuss the practical and theoretical implications of contingent matches for managers and academics.",1
Internet Recommendation Systems,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Several online firms, including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, and Movie Critic, recommend documents and products to consumers. Typically, the recommendations are based on content and/or collaborative filtering methods. The authors examine the merits of these methods, suggest that preference models used in marketing offer good alternatives, and describe a Bayesian preference model that allows statistical integration of five types of information useful for making recommendations: a person's expressed preferences, preferences of other consumers, expert evaluations, item characteristics, and individual characteristics. The proposed method accounts for not only preference heterogeneity across users but also unobserved product heterogeneity by introducing the interaction of unobserved product attributes with customer characteristics. The authors describe estimation by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and use the model with a large data set to recommend movies either when collaborative filtering methods are viable alternatives or when no recommendations can be made by these methods.",1
Modeling Multiple Relationships in Social Networks,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Firms are increasingly seeking to harness the potential of social networks for marketing purposes. Therefore, marketers are interested in understanding the antecedents and consequences of relationship formation within networks and in predicting interactivity among users. The authors develop an integrated statistical framework for simultaneously modeling the connectivity structure of multiple relationships of different types on a common set of actors. Their modeling approach incorporates several distinct facets to capture both the determinants of relationships and the structural characteristics of multiplex and sequential networks. They develop hierarchical Bayesian methods for estimation and illustrate their model with two applications: The first application uses a sequential network of communications among managers involved in new product development activities, and the second uses an online collaborative social network of musicians. The authors? applications demonstrate the benefits of modeling multiple relations jointly for both substantive and predictive purposes. They also illustrate how information in one relationship can be leveraged to predict connectivity in another relation.",1
E-Customization,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Customized communications have the potential to reduce information overload and aid customer decisions, and the highly relevant products that result from customization can form the cornerstone of enduring customer relationships. In spite of such potential benefits, few models exist in the marketing literature to exploit the Internet's unique ability to design communications or marketing programs at the individual level. The authors develop a statistical and optimization approach for customization of information on the Internet. The authors use clickstream data from users at one of the top ten most trafficked Web sites to estimate the model and optimize the design and content of such communications for each user. The authors apply the model to the context of permission-based e-mail marketing, in which the objective is to customize the design and content of the e-mail to increase Web site traffic. The analysis suggests that the content-targeting approach can potentially increase the expected number of click-throughs by 62%.",1
Customer Channel Migration,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors develop a model of customer channel migration and apply it to a retailer that markets over the Web and through catalogs. The model identifies the key phenomena required to analyze customer migration, shows how these phenomena can be modeled, and develops an approach for estimating the model. The methodology is unique in its ability to accommodate heterogeneous customer responses to a large number of distinct marketing communications in a dynamic context. The results indicate that (1) Web purchasing is associated with lower subsequent purchase volumes than when buying from other outlets; (2) marketing efforts are associated with channel usage and purchase incidence, offsetting negative Web experience effects; and (3) negative interactions occur between like communications (catalog ? catalog or e-mail ? e-mail) and between different types of communications (catalog ? e-mail). The authors find that over the four-year period of their data, a Web-oriented ?migration? segment emerged, and this group had higher sales volume. Their post hoc analysis suggests that marketing efforts and exogenous customer-level trends played key roles in forming these segments. The authors rule out alternative explanations, such as that the Web attracted customers who were already heavy users or that the Web developed these customers into heavier users. They conclude with a discussion of implications for both academics and practitioners.",1
Building a Social Network for Success,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This article proposes a framework for studying how a brand, firm, or individual can use networking activities to manage a social network and drive its success. Using data from ego networks of music artists, the article models how artists can enhance their social networking presence and stimulate relationships between fans to achieve long-term benefits in terms of music plays. The authors use a Bayesian modeling framework to model the heterogeneous and dynamic impact of networking activities on network structure and on music popularity, while relying on instrumental variables from another independent online social network to handle potential endogeneity. The results imply that artists can shape network structure via marketing activities and thereby achieve a long-term impact on success that far exceeds the direct and short-term impact in magnitude. Specifically, improving the density of ego networks enables long-term effects beyond those that stem from growth in network size.",1
How Does Enforcement Deter Gray Market Incidence?,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Gray market activity has become increasingly prevalent. The prevailing wisdom in marketing is to use more severe enforcement to deter gray marketing. However, the certainty and speed of enforcement may also have a bearing on the incidence of violations. This article examines whether and how enforcement deters gray marketing. The results from a field survey of manufacturers and an experimental design suggest that, by itself, enforcement severity has no impact. Deterrence results only when the multiple facets of enforcement are used in combination.",0
The Severity of Contract Enforcement in Interfirm Channel Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Little is known about how channel members react to violations of explicit contracts. The authors develop and test an integrative conceptual framework that focuses on the severity of the enforcement response in channel relationships. The empirical results provide evidence of discerning enforcement practices by channel members, reflecting channel system, network, and dyadic concerns.",0
Franchisor?Franchisee Bankruptcy and the Efficacy of Franchisee Governance,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Franchisors? long-term viability is tied to the ongoing operations of their franchisees. To ensure the ongoing performance of franchisees, franchisors deploy multiple governance mechanisms. This study assesses how governance mechanisms deployed to enhance franchisee ability (via selection and socialization) and motivation (via incentives and monitoring) impact franchisee bankruptcy. The authors examine the individual and joint effects of deploying governance mechanisms that share the same underlying objective, namely, to enhance franchisee ability and motivation. They also assess how motivation-inducing mechanisms may serve to counter the motivation-dampening effect of an increased royalty rate. Relying on data from multiple archival sources, the authors identify all bankruptcy filings by franchisees and their franchisors across 1,115 franchise systems over a 13-year observation window. Their findings document a positive and significant relationship between franchisee and franchisor bankruptcy. They also find main and interaction effects of the ability- and motivation-influencing governance mechanisms on the likelihood of franchisee bankruptcy, and the existence of significant bankruptcy spillovers among franchisees within the same franchise system. They discuss implications for franchise theory and management.",1
Conflict Management and Outcomes in Franchise Relationships: The Role of Regulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Franchise relationships are prone to conflict. To safeguard the rights of individual franchisees, several states have legislated greater franchisor disclosure (registration law) ex ante and/or franchisor ?termination for good cause? (relationship law) ex post. The impact of regulatory oversight on franchisor?franchisee conflict, however, remains unclear. Relying on agency theory arguments, the authors first assess the influence of the regulatory context, both by itself and in combination with the franchise ownership structure, on the incidence of litigated conflict. Conditional on litigation, they also predict the impact of franchise regulation on both the parties? litigation initiation and resolution choices and the resulting outcomes. The authors test the hypotheses using a unique multisource archival database of 411 instances of litigation across 75 franchise systems observed over 17 years. The results indicate that the regulatory context, by itself as well as in combination with the franchise ownership structure, significantly shapes parties? conflict management choices. The authors also find evidence of a trade-off between prevailing in the particular conflict and achieving franchise system growth objectives.",1
Spatiotemporal Allocation of Advertising Budgets,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This article develops a method for optimal allocation of resources based on an empirically validated model of how national and regional advertising generate sales over time. The authors derive the profit-maximizing total budget, its optimal split between national and regional spends, and its optimal allocation across multiple regions. They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a second-order differential equation for the Hamilton?Jacobi?Bellman (HJB) equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures). By solving the HJB equation analytically, the authors furnish closed-form expressions for the optimal total budget and its regional allocations. In addition, they develop a method to estimate the proposed model and apply it to market data from a leading German cosmetics company. Using the estimated parameters, they evaluate the optimal budget and allocations. Comparing them with actual company policy, the proposed approach enhances profit by 5.07%, and it not only identifies which regions under-or overspend but also reveals how much budget to shift from national to regional advertising (or vice versa).",1
A Multipurpose Shopping Trip Model to Assess Retail Agglomeration Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Multipurpose shopping is a prominent and relevant feature of shopping behavior. However, no methodology is available to assess empirically how the demand for multipurpose shopping depends on retail agglomeration or, in general, the characteristics of retail supply, such as the numbers and types of stores in a shopping center or the number of categories in a supermarket. The authors propose a nested-logit model that captures retail agglomeration effects on consumer choice of shopping trip purpose (what to buy) and destination (where to buy). The authors estimate parameters representing trip purpose-adjustment and between-store attraction effects on shopping trip data collected from a sample of 1704 households in The Netherlands. Both effects are significant for each of the three categories for which the model is estimated. This is consistent with the idea of agglomeration effects. The findings suggest that agglomeration helps attract not only multipurpose but also single-purpose trips. A comparison of multi- and single-purpose trip model predictions shows that single-purpose models underpredict the number of trips to larger shopping centers.",1
Consumer Contamination: How Consumers React to Products Touched by Others,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Although consumers like to touch products while shopping, the authors propose a theory of consumer contamination, positing that consumers evaluate products previously touched by other shoppers less favorably. The authors test the theory by manipulating cues that increase the salience that consumer contact has occurred. Furthermore, the authors investigate the role of disgust as the underlying mechanism of the theory.",0
Positive Consumer Contagion: Responses to Attractive Others in a Retail Context,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"This research examines the impact of attractiveness on consumers during a consumption experience. Specifically, it examines the effects of an attractive social influence in the context of touching and contamination of store products by investigating how consumers respond when they see attractive others touching the same products they want to purchase. In doing so, it provides the first experimental evidence of a positive contagion effect in either the marketing or the psychology literature. Across three field experiments using an actual retail shopping environment, the authors find that product evaluations are higher when consumers perceive a product as having been physically touched by a highly attractive other. Moreover, they identify sex as a critical moderating variable in the realization of this positive contagion effect; the contact source and observing consumer must be of the opposite sex for positive contagion to occur. Finally, in contrast to previous work, the authors demonstrate that these effects are driven by a physical model of contagion.",1
The Sound of Brands,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Recent research has demonstrated that linguistic characteristics of brand names can cognitively affect product evaluations. In six experiments, the authors demonstrate that affect arising from sound repetition may also be influential. The results reveal across multiple brand names and product categories that exposure to a brand name that has sound repetition in its phonetic structure and is spoken aloud produces positive affect, which favorably affects consumers? brand evaluations, reactions to cross-selling, and product choice. The effects are moderated by consumers? sensitivity to repetition, consumers? opportunity to experience emotions, and the degree to which the brand name's phonetic sound repetition deviates from linguistic expectations. The authors discuss implications for managers and avenues for further research.",0
When Do Consumers Eat More? The Role of Appearance Self-Esteem and Food Packaging Cues,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Prior research has found that under certain conditions, small packages can paradoxically increase consumption. The authors build on this work by suggesting that people low in appearance self-esteem (ASE) are particularly sensitive to external control properties (i.e., packaging-related factors that signal the ability of packaging to regulate food intake) and, as a result, increase consumption levels when packages are small (vs. large or absent). Factors that highlight the external control properties of small packages, such as the visibility of product quantity, location of the caloric content, and communicated caloric content, further increase consumption, particularly among people with low ASE. The underlying process appears to be, at least in part, cognitively driven. The effects are mitigated when participants are under cognitive load, and the findings are mediated by cognitions regarding the ability of small packages to regulate food intake. The results have important practical implications suggesting that to quell the effects of small packages on overconsumption, emphasis on the external control properties of small packages should be minimized.",0
Brand Portfolio Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Large firms implement brand portfolio promotions (BPPs) that promote multiple brands to targeted consumers at discrete times. Such programs possess unique properties that require a novel model to assess their effectiveness. The authors propose a model that captures the magnitude and shape of the BPP effect for each brand in the portfolio, accounts for diminishing returns of brand exposure, and incorporates the intertemporal effect of BPPs. The model is shown to be general enough to apply to any discrete promotion in which the carryover effect duration is unknown. The authors present several model-based metrics that allow for an objective comparison of a BPP's return on investment with that of other forms of promotion. The results suggest that a BPP, when contrasted with feature, leads to higher sales lift per household for some of the brands. The authors develop an optimal exposure allocation procedure based on the proposed model that informs (1) which assortments of brands to promote across multiple BPPs and (2) the exposure level for each brand.",1
Understanding the Role of Preference Revision and Concession in Group Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"In this article, the authors contend that member influence in a group's decision could be decomposed into two distinct elements of preference revision and concession. Using a hierarchical Bayes model of dyadic decision making, the authors show that the degree of preference revision and concession varies across product attributes, individuals, and product categories. The authors demonstrate that converging preferences affect a member's concession, which in turn affects members? satisfaction with the joint decision. More important, a member's satisfaction is higher when his or her concession is reciprocated.",1
Private Label Imitation of a National Brand: Implications for Consumer Choice and Law,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"In brand imitation lawsuits, the primary focus is on demonstrating harm as it relates to brand confusion. The authors' premise is that such a narrow focus does not capture the complete impact of brand imitation. They offer a broader, theory-based perspective of harm by proposing that brand imitation affects both brand consideration and preference in the consumer choice process. The authors establish a formal nexus between brand consideration and the legal doctrine ?initial interest confusion.? Using choice experiments and statistical modeling, they show that brand imitation harms the imitated brand even after controlling for brand confusion. Moreover, brand imitation harms not only the imitated brand but also other national brands in the category that are not being imitated. To quantify brand consideration and preference harm in financial terms, the authors propose two metrics: choice share shift and share-equalizing price cut. The results show that brand imitation harms the national brand more when the imitating brand is not associated with a well-known retailer and that brand imitation harm extends beyond brand confusion. The proposed framework provides both legal and managerial guidance.",1
Tipping the Scale: The Role of Discriminability in Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Conjoint analysis is a widely used method for determining how much certain attributes matter to consumers by observing a series of their choices. However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers? inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes. By illustrating the curvilinear relationship between scale expansion and multiple measures, the authors also offer practitioners some insight into the limits of scale expansion.",1
Category-Based Screening in Choice of Complementary Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Consumers often make complex choices involving complementary categories, such as cell phones and service plans. In the fast-growing high-tech and entertainment industries, products from complementary categories are often incompatible with one another. This research shows that when choosing a pair of such complementary products, a consumer is likely to use a two-stage decision strategy: screening by one category first to narrow down the number of pairs for further evaluation in the second stage. In the presence of incompatibility, screening by one category rather than by the other may lead to different choice outcomes. The authors develop a behavioral theory?driven choice model that accounts for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 ? 2 conjoint choice experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their decision goals. The authors further suggest possible marketing actions a firm can take to promote the use of a specific decision strategy that leads consumers to choose its product.",1
Raising the BAR: Bias Adjustment of Recognition Tests in Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Advertising recognition tests use advertisements as visual retrieval cues; they require consumers to report which advertisements they remember having seen earlier and whether they noticed the advertised brand and read most of the text at the time. Using a heterogeneous randomly stopped sum model, the authors establish the relationship between consumers' actual attention to print advertisements, as measured through eye tracking, and subsequent ad recognition measures. They find that ad recognition measures are systematically biased because consumers infer prior attention from the ad layout and their familiarity with the brands in the advertisements. Such biases undermine the validity of recognition tests for advertising practice and theory development. The authors quantify the positive and negative diagnostic value of ad recognition for prior attention and demonstrate how these diagnostic values can be used to develop bias-adjusted recognition (BAR) scores that more accurately reflect prior attention. Finally, the authors show that differences in the scores from ad recognition tests based on in-home versus lab exposure attenuate when the bias-adjustment procedure is applied.",1
"Native Advertising in Online News: Trade-Offs Among Clicks, Brand Recognition, and Website Trustworthiness",Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Native advertising is a type of online advertising that matches the form and function of the platform on which it appears. In practice, the choice between display and in-feed native advertising presents brand advertisers and online news publishers with conflicting objectives. Advertisers face a trade-off between ad clicks and brand recognition, whereas publishers need to strike a balance between ad clicks and the platform?s trustworthiness. For policy makers, concerns that native advertising confuses customers prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines for disclosing native ads. This research aims to understand how consumers respond to native ads versus display ads and to different styles of native ad disclosures, using randomized online and field experiments combining behavioral clickstream, eye movement, and survey response data. The results show that when the position of an ad on a news page is controlled for, a native ad generates a higher click-through rate because it better resembles the surrounding editorial content. However, a display ad leads to more visual attention, brand recognition, and trustworthiness for the website than a native ad.",1
When Do Losses Loom Larger than Gains?,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In defining limits to loss aversion, Novemsky and Kahneman (2005) offer important new data and a needed summary of appropriate ways to think about loss aversion. In this comment to Novemsky and Kahneman's article, the authors consider the new empirical results that involve probabilistic buying and selling, suggesting caution in generalizing the results to nonprobabilistic commerce. The authors expand Novemsky and Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion could evolve.",1
Do Chinese Trust Chinese? A Study of Chinese Buyers and Sellers in Malaysia,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The objective of this article is to identify the major determinants of trust in the context of industrial buying behavior among ethnic Chinese buyers and sellers in Malaysia. The authors adopt the dyadic approach to examine empirically the antecedents and consequences of trust to secure a realistic assessment of the determinants and outcome of trust. The authors employ structural equation modeling to test the proposed trust models. The study identifies perceived intention, organizational trust, strength of personal relationship, dialect fluency, and perceived similarity in cultural values as major determinants of trust among ethnic Chinese industrial buyers and sellers in Malaysia. One important managerial consideration is the need for companies to place more emphasis on the cultural and relational factors that affect trust. The results of the study confirm that the presence of trust enhances buyer?seller relationships among ethnic Chinese businesspeople. Along with satisfaction, trust between the buyer and seller dictates the probability of future interaction between the exchange parties, and thus trust is a central concept in the business exchange process.",0
The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Researchers suggest that developing long-term relationships with key stakeholders is an important strategy in today's intensely competitive business environment. Many organizations have embraced this concept, which is referred to as relationship marketing. Much of the research on relationship marketing success has examined relationships that (1) are primarily economic in nature, (2) involve business-to-business marketing, and (3) involve for-profit firms. However, the authors argue that relationship marketing is a viable strategy in such contexts as those involving high levels of social exchange, business-to-consumer marketing, and nonprofit marketing. In these contexts, relationship marketing success may require different relationship characteristics from those identified in previous research. The authors develop ?the identity salience model of relationship marketing success,? which they posit is useful for explaining relationship marketing success in exchange relationships that (1) involve individuals and (2) are based primarily on social exchange. The authors further develop and test the model in the context of nonprofit higher education marketing. The results provide support for the model.",0
The Implications of Offering Free Versions for the Performance of Paid Mobile Apps,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The mobile application (app) industry has grown tremendously over the past ten years, primarily fueled by small app development businesses. Lacking advertising budgets, these small and relatively unknown businesses often offer free versions of their paid apps to be noticed in the crowded app industry and to reduce customer uncertainty about app quality and fit. The authors build on the existing marketing and information systems literature on sampling and versioning to investigate the implications of offering free versions for the adoption speed of paid apps. Using a unique data set of 7.7 million observations from 12,315 paid apps, and accounting for endogeneity, the authors find that although the practice of offering free versions of paid apps is popular, it is negatively associated with paid app adoption speed. They also find that this negative association between free version presence and paid app adoption speed is stronger both for hedonic apps and in the later life stages of paid apps. The authors hope that the study's results will encourage app developers to reevaluate their current strategy of offering free versions of paid apps and prompt academics to produce more work focusing on this industry.",0
Retention Futility: Targeting High-Risk Customers Might be Ineffective,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.",1
Beyond the Target Customer: Social Effects of Customer Relationship Management Campaigns,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Customer relationship management (CRM) campaigns have traditionally focused on maximizing the profitability of the targeted customers. The authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted customers more valuable. These findings suggest that in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of the targeted customer but also the potential spillover of the campaign to nontargeted but connected customers.",1
The Perils of Proactive Churn Prevention Using Plan Recommendations: Evidence from a Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Facing the issue of increasing customer churn, many service firms have begun recommending pricing plans to their customers. One reason behind this type of retention campaign is that customers who subscribe to a plan suitable for them should be less likely to churn because they derive greater benefits from the service. In this article, the authors examine the effectiveness of such retention campaigns using a large-scale field experiment in which some customers are offered plan recommendations and some are not. They find that being proactive and encouraging customers to switch to cost-minimizing plans can, surprisingly, increase rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only 6% of customers in the control condition churned during the three months following the intervention, 10% did so in the treatment group. The authors propose two explanations for how the campaign increased churn, namely, (1) by lowering customers? inertia to switch plans and (2) by increasing the salience of past-usage patterns among potential churners. The data provide support for both explanations. By leveraging the richness of their field experiment, the authors assess the impact of targeted encouragement campaigns on customer behavior and firm revenues and derive recommendations for service firms.",1
When Talk is ?Free?: The Effect of Tariff Structure on Usage under Two- and Three-Part Tariffs,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"In many service industries, firms introduce three-part tariffs to replace or complement existing two-part tariffs. In contrast with two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or ?free? units of the service. Behavioral research suggests that the attributes of a pricing plan may affect behavior beyond their direct cost implications. Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly ?overuse? in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint. The authors estimate a discrete/continuous model of tariff choice and usage that accounts for the valuation of free units. The results show that the majority of three-part-tariff users value minutes under a three-part tariff more than they do under a two-part tariff. The authors derive recommendations for how the provider can exploit these insights to further increase revenues.",1
Extending Discrete Choice Models to Incorporate Attitudinal and Other Latent Variables,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"One of the nagging issues in using discrete choice models is how softer attributes, such as attitudes and perceptions, that are not explicitly manipulated within the context of the choice experiment can be accommodated. In many cases, it is reasonable to expect that the choice of a particular alternative may be influenced by non?product-related attributes. For example, latent attitudes and perceptions may play as much of a role in shaping choice as the attributes that have been manipulated and used to define the alternative offerings. In this article, the authors present several full information models that can accommodate latent variables such as attitudes and satisfaction within the context of binary and multinomial choice models. The models proposed are particularly useful when the focus is on understanding how softer attributes can influence choice decisions. The authors accomplish this by integrating structural equation models within the basic framework of binary and multinomial choice models. Two empirical applications are provided. In addition to illustrating the proposed models, these applications provide insights into the circumstances under which the simultaneous factor?choice modeling approach makes a difference.",1
The Application of the Technology Acceptance Model under Different Cultural Contexts: The Case of Online Shopping Adoption,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Global usage of the Internet has increased remarkably in the past few decades, thus necessitating a better understanding of e-commerce adoption across cultures. Against this backdrop, this study contributes to the existing technology adoption and acceptance literature in the following ways. First, the authors develop an extended technology acceptance model that incorporates trust and perceived behavioral control and examine it in settings outside the United States to better understand the adoption of e-commerce across cultures. Contrary to the authors? expectations, the predictive power of the technology acceptance model seems robust and holds true for both Pakistan and Canada, despite some noteworthy differences between the two cultures. Second, although the importance of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on consumers? intentions to shop online was validated across both cultures, the results highlight the complex relationships between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to adopt in each country. The authors offer suggestions to technology managers and e-retailers regarding navigating through new technology and e-commerce adoption under various cultural contexts.",0
The Role of M-Commerce Readiness in Emerging and Developed Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Although mobile commerce (m-commerce) growth provides ample potential for retailers around the globe, several studies have shown that it has failed to attract potential customers across different countries. This study advances the literature by comparing m-commerce customers? behavioral intentions and actual behaviors using data from 812 m-commerce users across four countries (Australia, India, the United States, and Pakistan). This context offers a unique opportunity for understanding how m-commerce consumers? behaviors differ across disparate national markets. The authors propose a conceptual framework linking m-commerce users? behaviors (intentions and actual usages) to key drivers (ubiquity and habit), and they develop hypotheses about the moderating roles of m-commerce readiness and habit in these linkages. The results reveal important asymmetries between m-commerce readiness stage and between habit: users at an early m-commerce readiness stage assign more importance to ubiquity relative to habit in influencing purchase intentions, whereas the opposite is true for the users who are at an advanced stage. Habit moderates the influence of ubiquity such that its importance in determining intention decreases as the behavior in question takes a more habitual nature. The authors outline how m-retailers operating across developed and developing countries should adapt their marketing strategies to customers at different m-commerce readiness stages.",0
Do Export Learning Processes Affect Sales Growth in Exporting Activities?,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"The understanding of experiential learning through export learning process (XLP), and its outcomes, is limited in the international marketing literature. Using multisource, time-lagged data of exporting firms in the United Kingdom and China, this study finds that XLP is positively associated with marketing strategy adaptation for both U.K. and Chinese exporters. Results suggest contrasting moderating effects of experiential knowledge resources (i.e., psychic dispersion, multinationality, and duration) and strategy adaptation on the relationship between XLP and export sales growth in the two samples. In the U.K. sample, the authors observe a positive moderation effect of psychic dispersion and negative moderation effects of multinationality and duration. For the China sample, they find the exact opposite pattern of moderation effects for the experiential knowledge resources. Marketing strategy adaptation plays a negative moderation role in the China sample but has no such effect in the U.K. sample. The study has implications for theory development on, and the productive management of, processes of learning export management.",0
The Role of After-Sales Service in International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"This study develops and tests a conceptual framework relating internationalization and after-sales service (AS) in international marketing activities. Specifically, the study tests the relationship between internationalization, importance of AS accompanying durable export products, and actual AS offerings in foreign markets. Level of foreign market competition, relative product quality, and marketer power in the foreign distribution channel were investigated as moderators in the relationship between AS importance and services actually offered in the foreign market. Research results generally support the hypotheses, suggesting that as firms internationalize, they come to understand the role of AS in international activities. However, there are factors that facilitate and/or inhibit the marketer's actual offering of these services.",0
Executive Insights: How does this Firm Make Money? Understanding your Overseas Partner1,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"It is common knowledge that the health of any relationship depends on the degree to which parties ?understand? the needs of each other. Businesses are exchange organizations created to make money. Therefore, in an international business relationship what the parties ?need? seems obvious and many would not belabor this issue. Although it is true that all businesses intend to make money, it is not true that they all make money the same way. One of the misconceptions of developed country executives going into international partnerships is that their foreign partners make their money the same way they do. Understanding the sources of profits of prospective foreign partners is important as they will determine whether there will be a partnership, and also whether a partnership will last.",0
"Consumer Packaged Goods in France: National Brands, Regional Chains, and Local Branding",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Using data from 50 U.S. markets, Bronnenberg, Dhar, and Dub (2007) observe that geographic variation is the predominant source of variation in national brand market shares. The authors of this comment extend this surprising and previously undocumented result in several respects. First, they replicate this basic finding in France and find that it is robust to time and region aggregation and data duration. Second, because of regional variation in chain locations and the limited research on the relative effect of chains on market shares, they link chain effects to market shares in France. The authors find that (1) chain effects explain more variation in market share than either time or region effects and (2) the addition of chain effects attenuates region-specific effects. Thus, chain structure is both another source of regional variation in demand and an important consideration in its own right. Finally, by coupling brand?time effects with longer data, the authors note that brand?time effects are larger than brand?region effects in France. This result suggests the importance of long-term effects in marketing and the need to collect longer durations of data to explain variation in market shares.",1
The Long-Term Effect of Marketing Strategy on Brand Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Few studies have considered the relative role of the integrated marketing mix (advertising, price promotion, product, and place) on the long-term performance of mature brands, instead emphasizing advertising and price promotion. Thus, little guidance is available to firms regarding the relative efficacy of their various marketing expenditures over the long run. To investigate this issue, the authors apply a multivariate dynamic linear transfer function model to five years of advertising and scanner data for 25 product categories and 70 brands in France. The findings indicate that the total (short-term plus long-term) sales elasticity is 1.37 for product and .74 for distribution. Conversely, the total elasticities for advertising and discounting are only .13 and .04, respectively. This result stands in marked contrast to the previous emphasis in the literature on price promotions and advertising. The authors further find that the long-term effects of discounting are one-third the magnitude of the short-term effects. The ratio is reversed from other aspects of the mix (in which long-term effects exceed four times the short-term effects), underscoring the strategic role of these tools in brand sales.",1
Open Negotiation: The Back-End Benefits of Salespeople?s Transparency in the Front End,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Negotiations today are less likely to be characterized by information asymmetry?the notion that buyers are less informed than sellers?due to the amount of information available to buyers. A number of industries have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main purchase (e.g., add-ons, insurance, financing, service and maintenance). In these aftermarkets, firms often retain an information advantage, even if information asymmetries are eliminated from the main purchase. This has given rise to an interesting setting untapped by prior research: information ?symmetry? in the front end (main purchase) and information ?asymmetry? in the back end (aftermarket). The authors argue that symmetry in the front end provides an opportunity to build trust, as the knowledgeable customer can verify the information disclosed by the seller. In an observational study in the automotive industry, the authors find that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the cost of a car at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in the back end than others. As corroborated in subsequent studies, this effect holds only when cost is disclosed at the beginning of the negotiation and when customers can verify the cost information.",1
Does Selective Sales Force Training Work?,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Companies spend billions of dollars annually on sales force training, often carried out as off-site, multiday training events. However, the numerous challenges involved in training an entire sales group force many retailers to selectively train only a subset of their salespeople. It is crucial to know when selective training can be more effective and what composition of salespeople should be trained to benefit the entire group. This study addresses these questions using data from several stores of a retailer with different sales force training policies (full, selective, and no training [control]). The authors track the degree to which salespeople applied a customer relationship?building strategy taught in the training, along with more than 30 store- and salesperson-level covariates, and perform various analyses to correct for selection issues. They find that (1) selective training can be highly effective in stores with low performance diversity, (2) training salespeople with diverse tenures helps the spillover of training to the untrained, and (3) untrained salespeople with performance that is similar to the trained group are more likely to adopt the training-related behavior.",1
Time Preferences and Mortgage Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Mortgage decisions have important consequences for consumers, lenders, and the state of the economy more generally. Mortgage decisions are also prototypical of consumer financial choices that involve a stream of expenditures and consumption occurring across time. The authors use heterogeneity in time preferences for both immediate (present bias) and long-term outcomes to explain a sequence of mortgage decisions, including mortgage choice and the decision to abandon a mortgage. The authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households augmented by zip code?level house price and foreclosure data. The model suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term patience increases mortgage abandonment. This reversal across mortgage decisions is difficult for alternative accounts to explain. These results suggest that a two-parameter model of time preferences is helpful for understanding how homeowners make mortgage decisions.",1
International Licensing of Technology: An Empirical Study of the Differences between Licensee and Non-Licensee Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"Despite the increasing importance of international licensing as a source of new technology for many firms, limited research has investigated the differences between licensee and non-licensee firms? characteristics. An analysis of a sample of Australian firms indicates that licensee firms are significantly different from non-licensee firms along management characteristics, management's perceptions of competition in their industry, and of the costs and benefits of licensing. Surprisingly, no statistically significant differences were found between the two types of firms regarding internal capabilities. Implications from these findings are discussed.",0
The Influence of New Product Factors on Export Propensity and Performance: An Empirical Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This study investigates the unique role of new product factors in the firm's propensity to export and its performance in exporting new products. Results from a sample of Australian firms show that product advantage, proficiency of pre development activities, and international orientation of the development process have significant positive influence on the firm's propensity to export new products. Further, the new product's domestic market performance and its impact on the sales and profitability of other products of the firm are significantly related to its export performance. A noteworthy finding is that firm factors overwhelm new product factors in explaining export performance of new products. Managerial implications of the findings are explored.",0
Resolving the Capability?Rigidity Paradox in New Product Innovation,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Managers face an important strategic dilemma in product innovation: how to exploit existing product innovation competencies (competence exploitation) while avoiding their dysfunctional rigidity effects by renewing and replacing them with entirely new competencies (competence exploration). Although the resolution of what is termed the ?capability?rigidity paradox? is considered a fundamental managerial task in enhancing product innovation outcomes and the firm's competitive advantage, it has received little research attention. The author argues and finds support that market orientation provides a key to this paradox. Specifically, customer and competitor orientations ensure simultaneous investments in exploiting existing product innovation competencies and exploring new ones. The author also finds that the effects of these orientations on competence exploitation and exploration are differentially moderated by interfunctional coordination and perceived market opportunity. Regarding outcomes, competence exploitation and exploration have opposing relationships with incremental and radical innovation performance. However, the relationship between competence exploration and radical innovation performance is positively moderated by interfunctional coordination. Overall, the results of this study suggest that market orientation can prevent a firm from becoming operationally efficient but strategically inefficient by simultaneously engendering competence exploitation and exploration, which are differentially related to incremental and radical product innovation outcomes.",0
When Does Trust Matter? Antecedents and Contingent Effects of Supervisee Trust on Performance in Selling New Products in China and the United States,Journal of Marketing,2002,"There is a strong normative bias toward the inherent value of trust among both marketing researchers and practitioners. Yet there is little empirical evidence of a positive impact of trust on performance. Indeed, scholars suggest that the sources of trust may provide opportunities for its abuse. Following this line of thinking, the authors investigate the dual roles of sales controls and supervisor behaviors as antecedents of salespeople's belief in the benevolence of the supervisor (i.e., supervisee trust). The authors then examine these antecedents as moderators of the relationship between supervisee trust and sales performance in the context of selling new products. Data on field salespeople from high-technology firms in China and the United States suggest that factors such as supervisor accessibility engender supervisee trust but do not necessarily enhance its impact on sales performance. In the Chinese sample, supervisee trust enhances sales performance when output control is adopted, when the supervisor has a higher level of achievement orientation style, and when the salesperson has higher role ambiguity. Furthermore, the results suggest that the supervisee trust?sales performance relationship is negative when supervisor accessibility is high. With the exception of achievement orientation and supervisor accessibility, these effects are negative or nonexistent in the U.S. sample. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of the study's findings.",0
Antecedents and Outcomes of Marketing Strategy Comprehensiveness,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Comprehensiveness has long been recognized as a key feature of marketing strategy decision making. However, few studies have examined its antecedents and the conditions under which it influences performance. This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of marketing strategy by investigating project-level antecedents and outcomes of marketing strategy comprehensiveness (MSC). Drawing on contingency and institutional theories perspectives, the authors develop and test the effects of output and process rewards, task conflict, and project members? intra- and extraindustry relationships on MSC. They find that whereas process reward and extraindustry relationships are positively related to MSC, task conflict (when combined with conflict avoidance) hinders its development. Furthermore, the results indicate that MSC has a more positive effect on performance when implementation speed is higher. Finally, the authors discover that technology and market uncertainties differentially moderate the relationship between MSC and performance; the former has a positive effect, and the latter has a negative effect. The authors also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of their findings.",0
Exploratory and Exploitative Learning in New Product Development: A Social Capital Perspective on New Technology Ventures in China,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"The authors examine the differential effects of the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital on exploratory and exploitative learning in new product development in new ventures in China. In addition to investigating the potential nonlinear relationships between exploratory and exploitative learning and new product performance, the authors examine the relationship between the interaction of the two types of learning and new product performance. The findings suggest that different dimensions of social capital are indeed significantly related to the level of exploratory and exploitative learning. The results also support the argument that firms need a balance of exploratory and exploitative learning to enhance performance. The findings draw the attention of managers from multinational firms operating in China to the important role of social capital in enhancing new product performance.",0
When Does Customer Participation Matter? An Empirical Investigation of the Role of Customer Empowerment in the Customer Participation?Performance Link,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Research on customer participation (CP) has focused on its benefits for customers. However, recent research suggests that CP is beneficial to both customers and firms. The literature is also sparse on the economic (e.g., profitability) and customer (e.g., customer retention) impact of CP. This research introduces the concept of customer empowerment and develops and tests a model of customer empowerment as a parallel mediator, along with customer satisfaction, to explain the linkage between CP and bank branch performance. Furthermore, the authors draw on a broader set of moderators beyond customer characteristics to examine when CP affects empowerment and satisfaction. Using triadic matched data from a multiwave design and a three-level model in which customers are nested within employees, who are, in turn, nested within bank branches, the authors show that customer empowerment and satisfaction fully mediate the effect of CP on branch performance. The findings also show that CP results in greater customer empowerment and satisfaction when there is fit between participation and the context in which it is used. The authors discuss implications for advancing CP research and suggest actionable steps for reaping the economic and customer benefits of CP.",1
An Assessment of Theoretical and Methodological Development in International Marketing: 1980-1990,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This study examines the state of the art in international marketing research published in the 1980?90 period, and probes significant changes in the field, both in terms of the substance of research and methodologies employed. A major conclusion of the previous review articles (Albaum and Peterson 1984; Boddewyn 1981; Cavusgil and Nevin 1981) was that international marketing research had been fragmentary and exploratory without a strong theoretical framework. In this study, we find that the field has since made substantial progress both in the development of conceptual frameworks for the studies conducted and in the empirical testing of concepts and theories.",0
Adding Bricks to Clicks: Predicting the Patterns of Cross-Channel Elasticities over Time,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors propose a conceptual framework to explain whether and when the introduction of a new retail store channel helps or hurts sales in existing direct channels. A conceptual framework separates short- and long-term effects by analyzing the capabilities of a channel that help consumers accomplish their shopping goals. To test the theory, the authors analyze a unique data set from a high-end retailer using matching methods. The authors study the introduction of a retail store and find evidence of cross-channel cannibalization and synergy. The presence of a retail store decreases sales in the catalog but not the Internet channel in the short run but increases sales in both direct channels over time. Following the opening of the store, more first-time customers begin purchasing in the direct channels. These results suggest that adding a retail store to direct channels yields different results from adding an Internet channel to a retail store channel, as previous research has indicated.",0
Price Promotion for Emotional Impact,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Managers and academics often think of price promotions merely as incentives that entice consumers to accept offers that they might not have considered otherwise. Yet the prospect of paying a lower price for a product of given quality can also discourage deliberation, in a sense ?dumbing down? the purchase encounter by making it less consequential. The authors examine this possibility in a dual-system theory of consumer behavior. Specifically, they argue that price promotion lowers a consumer's motivation to exert mental effort, in which case purchase decisions are guided less by extensive information processing and more by a quicker, easier, strong conditioner of preference: affect. Field data from a large daily deal company and four controlled experiments support this idea and document its implications primarily for product choice, in turn providing insight into the form and cause of brand switching that manufacturers and retailers can leverage to improve the allocation of promotional budgets and category management.",0
Setting the Theoretical Foundations of Importing Research: Past Evaluation and Future Perspectives,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Although prior efforts have been made to review research on importing, an updated, integrated, and chronological assessment of its theoretical evolution is lacking. This study critically investigates the theoretical foundations of importing research using a comprehensive review of 321 importing-related articles published during the 1960?2010 period. The analysis reveals that, although in general this research adopts a certain theoretical perspective, a notable part of it is not theoretically anchored. Of those studies that rely on theories, the most commonly used are the neoclassical micro-economic model, the behavioral model, and transaction cost economics. These theories were mainly associated with international buying behavior, importer?exporter relationships, and strategic aspects of importing. The study also identifies a range of other important topics that could be investigated using extant theories. In addition, the authors propose several other theories not previously employed, such as the institutional, stakeholder, and resource dependence theories, to be used in the study of new research issues. Finally, the authors suggest several actions toward theory advancement, including the need to integrate multiple theoretical paradigms, adjust theory to different environments, combine quantitative and qualitative inputs, cross-fertilize ideas from various disciplines, and periodically assess developments in the importing literature.",0
"The Effect of Electronic Word of Mouth on Sales: A Meta-Analytic Review of Platform, Product, and Metric Factors",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The increasing amount of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has significantly affected the way consumers make purchase decisions. Empirical studies have established an effect of eWOM on sales but disagree on which online platforms, products, and eWOM metrics moderate this effect. The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 1,532 effect sizes across 96 studies covering 40 platforms and 26 product categories. On average, eWOM is positively correlated with sales (.091), but its effectiveness differs across platform, product, and metric factors. For example, the effectiveness of eWOM on social media platforms is stronger when eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity to eWOM senders, whereas these homophily details do not influence the effectiveness of eWOM for e-commerce platforms. In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services. With respect to the eWOM metrics, eWOM volume has a stronger impact on sales than eWOM valence. In addition, negative eWOM does not always jeopardize sales, but high variability does.",1
Is A 70% Forecast more Accurate than a 30% Forecast? How Level of a Forecast Affects Inferences about Forecasts and Forecasters,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing). The authors identify boundary conditions, generalize to other prediction formats, and demonstrate consequences of their findings.",1
Walking in My Shoes: How Expectations of Role Reversal in Future Negotiations Affect Present Behaviors,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors focus on repeated distributive negotiations to investigate how expectations of role reversal in future transactions (i.e., a buyer [seller] in one transaction is the seller [buyer] in the next transaction) affect behaviors in the current negotiation. They demonstrate that when negotiators expect a role reversal, they are likely to make more concessions and reach agreement more quickly in the current negotiation. The authors find that this effect is driven by negotiators? beliefs that they will be able to recover these concessions, because negotiators expect their counterparts to reciprocate in the later transaction when the parties reverse roles. However, when the two negotiations occur in different ?accounting? periods (i.e., fiscal periods) or when the negotiating parties do not explicitly communicate their willingness to reverse roles in the future, role-reversal expectations do not affect concession making. Implications arise in both managerial and consumer contexts where the possibility of engaging in future negotiations?as well as reversing roles?exists.",1
Financial Development and Country-Level Advertising Spending: The Moderating Role of Economic Development and National Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Firms invest in brand capital through advertising. Financial constraints hinder firms? ability to fund their investment projects. Empirical studies in the finance literature suggest that firms? access to external financial resources, labeled ?financial development,? affects their investment behavior. The authors take the view of advertising spending as investment in brands and study the effect of financial development on advertising spending at the country level using a panel of 59 developing and developed countries during 1990?2016. The results suggest that financial development has a positive and significant effect on advertising spending, and this effect is stronger in countries with a low level of economic development. Furthermore, the authors investigate the role of national culture dimensions including uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, collectivism, masculinity, and power distance in the relationship between financial development and advertising. Overall, the results provide evidence that the impact of financial development on advertising spending depends on the national culture dimensions.",0
Financial Value of Brands in Mergers and Acquisitions: Is Value in the Eye of the Beholder?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"In mergers and acquisitions (M&As), brands account for significant but heterogeneous proportions of overall transaction value. The marketing literature focuses on the drivers of financial value of brands when there is no change in the ownership of brands. However, in M&As, the value of brands also depends on how their new owners leverage them. This study identifies both the target and the acquirer firm characteristics that affect the value of a target firm's brands in M&As. The study uses audited measures of acquired brand value from Securities and Exchange Commission filings (made available as a result of recent statutory reporting requirements) along with data collected from diverse secondary sources. The empirical test of the model is based on 133 M&A transactions in which acquirers attribute value to target firms? brands. The results indicate that acquirer and target marketing capabilities and brand portfolio diversity have positive effects on a target firm's brand value. The positive impact of acquirer brand portfolio diversity and target marketing capability is lower when the M&A is synergistic than when it is nonsynergistic. The findings are robust to various model specifications, measures, endogeneity, and sample selection.",0
"Dual Business Relationships, Opportunity Knowledge, and New Product Development: A Study on Returnee Young Ventures",Journal of International Marketing,2019,"The effects on innovation of the dual embeddedness of returnee young ventures (RYVs) in both domestic and international networks of relationships and knowledge contexts are important for value creation, growth, and success of these firms and embody a unique research opportunity. Drawing on a framework combining a business relationship perspective and the knowledge-based view, the authors propose that RYVs take advantage of business relationships and opportunity knowledge from both international and domestic markets to nurture their innovation. They test their model on a sample of 200 RYVs in China. The findings reveal that business relationships are essential for acquiring knowledge about technological and business opportunities, though only international opportunity knowledge and domestic business relationships positively influence new product development. In addition, the interaction between international and domestic business relationships constrains firms? capacity for obtaining international opportunity knowledge. This study offers insights into how the trade-offs between dual relationships and subsequently sourced knowledge contribute to new product development in emerging markets, and it extends the discussion on the paradox view of business relationships with geographically dispersed actors.",0
Investigating how Word-of-Mouth Conversations about Brands Influence Purchase and Retransmission Intentions,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This study investigates how the valence, channel, and social tie strength of a word-of-mouth (WOM) conversation about a brand relate to the purchase intentions and WOM retransmission intentions of WOM recipients. The analysis uses a nationally representative sample of 186,775 individual conversations about 804 different brands. The authors find insights linking WOM valence, WOM channel, and social tie strength that could not be revealed if the WOM conversations were analyzed in an aggregated form. The findings contribute to research that investigates differences between offline WOM and online WOM. The authors find that the relationship of WOM valence with purchase intentions is exacerbated when the conversation occurs offline, whereas offline conversations tend to be more strongly associated with WOM retransmission intentions regardless of the conversation's valence. The results also provide insights into how interpersonal characteristics influence WOM outcomes. Specifically, the authors find that the strength of the social tie relationship tends to influence a WOM receiver's intentions to purchase a brand; however, social tie strength has a much weaker association with a consumer's WOM retransmission intentions.",1
The Influence of Multiple Store Environment Cues on Perceived Merchandise Value and Patronage Intentions,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Research on how store environment cues influence consumers' store choice decision criteria, such as perceived merchandise value and shopping experience costs, is sparse. Especially absent is research on the simultaneous impact of multiple store environment cues. The authors propose a comprehensive store choice model that includes (1) three types of store environment cues (social, design, and ambient) as exogenous constructs, (2) various store choice criteria (including shopping experience costs that heretofore have not been included in store choice models) as mediating constructs, and (3) store patronage intentions as the endogenous construct. They then empirically examine the extent to which environmental cues influence consumers' assessments of a store on various store choice criteria and how those assessments, in turn, influence patronage intentions. The results of two different studies provide support for the model. The authors conclude by discussing the results to develop an agenda for additional research and explore managerial implications.",0
Brand Origin Identification by Consumers: A Classification Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors apply a classification perspective to (1) examine the extent to which consumers can identify the correct country of origin (COO) of different brands of consumer durables, (2) investigate the factors facilitating/hindering correct COO identification, and (3) trace the implications of correct/incorrect COO identification on brand evaluation. The results from a U.K. sample indicate that consumers? ability to classify brands correctly according to their origin is limited and also reveal substantial differences in the classification of different brands to their COO. Moreover, the key antecedent of correct COO identification is consumer ethnocentrism, with sociodemographics (e.g., age, gender) also playing a role. Finally, the authors find that though there are differences in brand evaluations depending on whether the correct COO was identified, such differences are not observed for all brands investigated.",0
Gains and Losses from the Misperception of Brand Origin: The Role of Brand Strength and Country-of-Origin Image,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Mounting empirical evidence shows that consumers often associate brands with the wrong country of origin (COO) or are unable to classify a brand to any COO. In this study, the authors investigate the consequences of brand origin misclassification and nonclassification on consumers? brand image evaluations and associated purchase intentions. Drawing from categorization theory, the authors test hypotheses regarding the impact of brand strength and COO image on misclassification gains and losses on a sample of U.K. consumers. The results show that both misclassification and non-classification have mostly adverse consequences on both brand evaluations and purchase intentions. The findings further show that strong brands are not immune to misclassification and stress the importance of ensuring that consumers are aware of a brand's true COO.",0
Consumer Xenocentrism as Determinant of Foreign Product Preference: A System Justification Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Foreign and domestic product purchase behavior largely depends on consumer predispositions. The dominant construct in international marketing literature explaining such behavior has been consumer ethnocentrism, which is conceptually anchored in social identity theory. However, such a perspective overlooks evidence that certain consumers are consistently attracted by the ?foreignness? of a product. Drawing from system justification theory, the present investigation conceptualizes and provides an empirical test of the consumer xenocentrism construct that is intended to explain consumer attraction toward foreign products. Using survey data from five complementary studies, the authors develop and validate a new scale (the C-XENSCALE) to measure consumers? xenocentric tendencies and offer extensive evidence on its ability to explain consumer preferences for foreign products. The authors discuss implications of the findings for theory and managerial practice and identify future research directions.",0
Favoritism Toward Foreign and Domestic Brands: A Comparison of Different Theoretical Explanations,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Five theoretical approaches can predict favoritism toward domestic and foreign brands. This article applies a contrastive perspective to examine social identity, personal identity, cultural identity, system justification, and categorical cognition theories and their attendant constructs. The authors propose a set of main-effects hypotheses as well as hypotheses related to both product and country moderation effects on attitudes toward and loyalty to domestic and foreign brands. They test the hypotheses on a sample of Chinese consumers with respect to salient brands from 12 product categories. The results indicate that three of the theoretical approaches examined can explain only one side of favoritism?most commonly favoritism toward domestic brands?but not favoritism toward both domestic and foreign brands. Consumer xenocentrism, a concept rooted in system justification theory, seems to provide more consistent predictions for both domestic- and foreign-brand bias.",0
Provision of Optional versus Standard Product Features in Competition,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Competing brands differ in the extent to which they offer a given feature as standard or optional in their product lines. In this article, the authors study the competitive basis for this difference in brands? product line strategies. Specifically, they analyze the relationship between a brand's quality image and its propensity to offer a wider product line, from a relatively stripped-down base model to a more feature-rich model. They develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses by considering an analytical model with two vertically differentiated firms: They show that a low-quality firm would offer a feature as optional?that is, it would offer both a feature-added product and a stripped-down base product?if it chose to add the feature to its product. In contrast, a high-quality firm would offer the feature as a standard component unless the cost of the feature was high. This asymmetry in the propensity of high- and low-quality firms to offer optional and standard features with their products is tested using data from the U.S. passenger car market; the authors find empirical support for their model.",0
Reciprocal Spillover Effects: A Strategic Benefit of Brand Extensions,Journal of Marketing,2003,"A commonly advanced rationale for the proliferation of brand extensions is companies? motivation to leverage the equity in established brands, thereby developing profitable products relatively easily. A more interesting strategic argument for brand extensions that has been advanced is that extensions would favorably affect the image of the parent brand and thereby influence its choice. In this research, the authors investigate the existence of such reciprocal spillover effects emanating from the advertising of a brand extension. The authors use scanner panel data and study spillover effects of advertising on brand choice. They develop implications for brand and product line management.",0
Consumers' Search and Use of Nutrition Information: The Challenge and Promise of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Four studies investigate the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act's (NLEA's) impact on how consumers use nutrition information. Field and laboratory studies compare, but do not detect any changes in, consumers' search for nutrition information or their recall of this information in the pre- and post-NLEA periods. However, the search activities of a select group (highly motivated and less knowledgeable consumers) benefited more from the NLEA than did other groups. Additional results from the field and lab studies indicate that the NLEA changed attention to negative nutrition attributes (such as fat and sodium, of which less is better) more than it changed attention to positive attributes such as calcium and vitamins. Analyses of scanner databases confirm this trend (with the exception of calories). Focus group results also reflect these findings. The authors discuss implications for public policy, management, academic research, and consumer welfare.",0
Cross-Cultural Differences in Intrachannel Communications: The United States and India,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Findings of a comparative study of intrachannel communication in marketing channels in the United States and India are presented. Two factors?the cultural environment and the degree of relational-ism in channel relationships?were posited to affect the nature of supplier-dealer communications. A survey of lighting equipment dealers in the two countries indicated that compared to the U.S. environment, the Indian environment was characterized by greater unidirectional communication from supplier to dealer, lower communication frequency, greater use of formal communication modes, and greater supplier use of direct influence strategies. A relational channel structure neutralized the differences in communication patterns due to cultural differences, however.",0
Indirect Learning: How Emerging-Market Firms Grow in Developed Markets,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Some emerging-market firms have recently achieved substantial growth in developed markets despite having had little prior experience in these markets. What explains the performance of these firms? Building on the organizational learning literature, the authors argue that indirect learning (i.e., learning from the experience of others) plays a crucial role in explaining this phenomenon. Specifically, they propose that emerging-market firms that grow in developed markets overcome their lack of direct experience in such markets by learning indirectly through their leaders, competitors, and interfirm networks. The authors test their thesis by comparing the international growth in developed markets of a sample of emerging-market firms (116 Indian firms) with a sample of developed-market firms (160 U.K. firms). The results support the authors' thesis about the importance of indirect learning in explaining the international growth of emerging-market (relative to developed-market) firms in developed markets. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for policy makers in the areas of higher education, competition policy, and international trade as well as for managers in the areas of middle-management recruitment, competitor analysis and tracking, and managing interfirm networks.",0
Corporate Environmentalism: Antecedents and Influence of Industry Type,Journal of Marketing,2003,"How does a business firm manage its relationship with the natural environment? What are the factors that influence the choice of such strategies? Does industry type matter? The authors introduce and operationalize the concept of corporate environmentalism in an effort to answer these questions. Using stakeholder theory, the authors identify four important antecedents to corporate environmentalism, namely, public concern, regulatory forces, competitive advantage, and top management commitment. The authors then use a political?economic framework to develop testable hypotheses. To test the hypotheses, the authors perform multigroup path analysis on data gathered from more than 240 firms. They find that corporate environmentalism is related to all hypothesized antecedents and that industry type moderates several of those relationships. In the high environmental impact sector, public concern has the greatest impact on corporate environmentalism, followed by regulatory forces. In the moderate environmental impact sector, competitive advantage has the greatest impact on corporate environmentalism, followed by regulatory forces. There are strong direct and mediating influences from top management commitment, which is the antecedent with the greatest impact on both industry groups. The influences of regulatory forces, public concern, and competitive advantage are all significantly mediated by top management commitment and moderated by industry type. The empirical findings and the ensuing discussion will be of interest to managers and public policy officials.",0
Broadcasting and Narrowcasting: How Audience Size Affects What People Share,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Does the number of people with whom someone communicates influence what he or she discusses and shares? Six studies demonstrate that compared with narrowcasting (i.e., communicating with just one person), broadcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people) leads consumers to avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. Narrowcasting, however, encourages people to share content that is useful to the message recipient. These effects are driven by communicators? focus of attention. People naturally tend to focus on the self, but communicating with just one person heightens other-focus, which leads communicators to share less self-presenting content and more useful content. These findings shed light on the drivers of word of mouth and provide insight into when the communication sender (vs. receiver) plays a relatively larger role in what people share.",1
The Role of (Dis)similarity in (Mis)predicting Others? Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers readily indicate that they like options that appear dissimilar?for example, enjoying both rustic lake vacations and chic city vacations, or liking both scholarly documentary films and action-packed thrillers. However, when predicting other consumers? tastes for the same items, people believe that a preference for one precludes enjoyment of the dissimilar other. Five studies show that people sensibly expect others to like similar products, but erroneously expect others to dislike dissimilar ones. While people readily select dissimilar items for themselves (particularly if the dissimilar item is of higher quality than a similar one), they fail to predict this choice for others?even when monetary rewards are at stake. The tendency to infer dislike from dissimilarity is driven by a belief that others have narrow and homogeneous ranges of preferences.",1
"EXPRESS: Not All Wrongdoers Are Equal in the Public Eye: A Moderated Mediation Model of Country Stereotypes, Condemning Emotions, and Retaliatory Intent in Corporate Crises",Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Corporate crises generate condemning emotions and retaliatory intent toward wrongdoing companies. However, not all wrongdoers are equal in the public eye. Consumers? prior beliefs about a company?s country-of-origin may bias these responses. In three experimental studies (combined N = 1,008), the authors (1) establish that country stereotypes of warmth ? but not of competence ? can buffer condemning emotions and retaliatory intent toward a wrongdoing company. They further (2) reveal the psychological mechanism of greed attributions that underlies this bias and (3) identify the type of crisis as a crucial contingency factor that facilitates (corporate ability crisis) or suppresses (corporate value crisis) the buffering effect of country warmth.",0
Executive Insights: United Colors of Benetton?From Sweaters to Success: An Examination of the Triumphs and Controversies of a Multinational Clothing Company,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Often regarded as a leader in the multinational marketing industry, United Colors of Benetton continues to face the challenge of effectively marketing clothes across racial, cultural, and religious borders. Changes in market trends and consumer demands have required the Italian company to redevelop its manufacturer and retail processes in order to remain competitive in the growing market. Renowned for using social issue?themed pictures to promote its brand, Benetton's campaigns have resulted in increasing legal and ethical concerns, and world courts have now been asked to define further the line between artistic expression and exploitation. The author discusses the legal action taken against Benetton by its own retailers that claim that the explicit advertisements have resulted in fewer sales. The author reviews different consumer responses to Benetton's unique campaigns with respect to changes in global politics and more frequent acts of terrorism. The author offers suggestions as to how Benetton's unique advertising strategies can better reach the modern market.",0
Opportunism as the Inhibiting Trigger for Developing Long-Term-Oriented Western Exporter?Hong Kong Importer Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Notwithstanding the extensive literature on opportunism in buyer?seller relationships, scant empirical attention has been given to this issue in both international and Chinese contexts. Using a sample of 202 Hong Kong Chinese importers, this article highlights the harmful effect of Western exporters? opportunism on importers? long-term orientation through the intervening role of key behavioral constructs. The study confirms almost all hypothesized associations between the constructs examined, indicating that an exporter's opportunistic behavior reduces trust and generates conflict. In turn, low trust reduces commitment, and conflict impedes communication. Low levels of both commitment and communication reduce importers? satisfaction, which inhibits their long-term orientation. The importer's proactive initiation of the relationship moderates the link between opportunism and trust but not that of opportunism with conflict. The study also confirms the moderating role of importer dependence and exporters? marketing adaptation on the association of satisfaction with long-term orientation. The authors find moderating effects on this association through the Chinese constructs of renqing and mianzi, albeit in the opposite direction to that hypothesized.",0
Interpersonal Factors as Drivers of Quality and Performance in Western?Hong Kong Interorganizational Business Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"The authors report the findings of a study conducted among a sample of 202 Hong Kong?based Chinese importing companies regarding their working relationships with Western export manufacturers. In particular, the study emphasizes the effect of interpersonal factors on financial performance through the intervening roles of intercompany trust and relationship quality. Using structural equation modeling, the authors confirm that (1) several interpersonal relational dimensions?namely, personal communication (sijiao), personal credibility (xinyong), and personal affection (ganqing)?positively influence interfirm trust; (2) trust plays an instrumental role in enhancing the components of the interfirm relationship quality (i.e., cooperation, commitment, and satisfaction); (3) interfirm relationship quality is positively related to superior financial performance; and (4) most of the associations between each of the interpersonal factors and interfirm trust were moderated by the importer's size and foreign supplier's origin as well as by the length of the relationship and which party initiated the relationship. The authors extract several conclusions and implications from the findings and provide directions for further research.",0
The Innovator's License: A Latitude to Deviate from Category Norms,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Firms often look for ways to improve the return on investment they earn from costly innovation strategies. The authors investigate a previously unexplored benefit of innovation that occurs when a brand's reputation as a provider of valued new offerings allows it to earn innovation credit, a form of customer-based brand equity. Innovation credit provides brands with the license or latitude to use strategies that violate category norms without the penalty (in the form of impaired attitudes) that consumers are shown to levy on less innovative brands. Consistent with the proposed theoretical framework, three studies demonstrate that innovative brands are granted the license to employ nonnormative strategies without sanction. In addition to providing evidence regarding the inferential mechanism underlying this licensing effect, Study 3 shows that, under certain conditions, innovative brands not only escape the penalty associated with using atypical strategies but are actually rewarded for utilizing such approaches. The authors provide theoretical and managerial implications of these findings and suggestions for further research in this emerging area of innovation research.",0
Consumer Response to Retailers? Use of Partially Comparative Pricing,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Consumers sometimes encounter a combination of comparative and noncomparative prices in the marketplace. For example, a grocer may employ signage that provides favorable price comparisons with those of a competitor for a portion of its products, a practice that the authors refer to as ?partially comparative pricing.? The authors examine the effects of partially comparative pricing on consumer response and find that it has both desirable and undesirable effects. On the one hand, such pricing enhances consumers? beliefs about the relative prices of comparatively priced products and about the retailer's relative prices in general. On the other hand, such pricing also reduces consumers? relative price beliefs about noncomparatively priced products and their intentions to purchase such products. The authors further show that the adverse influence of partially comparative pricing stems from consumers? suspicions about why price comparisons exist for some, but not all, products. They also document how these effects depend on store patronage. They discuss implications of their research and provide suggestions for future empirical efforts.",0
Does Exclusivity Always Pay Off? Exclusive Price Promotions and Consumer Response,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Although customized price promotions are increasingly common in the marketplace, relatively little is known about how deal recipients evaluate them. The authors investigate the role of a promotional characteristic that has received little attention in the literature by examining whether consumers? responsiveness to a targeted discount is influenced by their perceptions of the deal's exclusivity (i.e., the degree to which the offer is available only to them or to other consumers as well). The results demonstrate that exclusive promotions may be viewed more, equally, or less favorably than inclusive offers, depending on several factors used in decisions about the delivery of targeted offers (e.g., customer demographics, transactional histories). Specifically, the authors find that exclusive deals are favored over inclusive offers (Study 1), a preference that is pronounced for consumers adopting independent self-construals (Study 2) and for male consumers with a history of purchasing from the marketer providing the offer (Study 3). These exclusivity effects are mediated by the ability of the promotional offer to allow consumers to engage in self-enhancement (Study 3).",0
"Advertising and Consumer Awareness of New, Differentiated Products",Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This article proposes a novel approach to assess the dynamic effect that advertising expenditures have on which products consumers include in their choice sets. In a discrete-choice model, consumers face choice sets that evolve according to their awareness of each product. Advertising expenditures have a dynamic effect in the sense that they raise consumer awareness of a product, increasing present and future sales. To estimate this effect, the authors explicitly model the firms? dynamic advertising decisions and illustrate the model using data from the Spanish automobile market. The results show that the effect of advertising on awareness is dynamic and that accounting for it is crucial in explaining the evolution of product sales over its life cycle. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the awareness process can be significantly sped up by advertising. Thus, there is a great heterogeneity in the length of the awareness process among products, depending on the level of advertising expenditures; it may range from one to six years.",1
Are the Drivers and Role of Online Trust the Same for All Web Sites and Consumers? A Large-Scale Exploratory Empirical Study,Journal of Marketing,2005,"The authors develop a conceptual model that links Web site and consumer characteristics, online trust, and behavioral intent. They estimate this model on data from 6831 consumers across 25 sites from eight Web site categories, using structural equation analysis with a priori and post hoc segmentation. The results show that the influences of the determinants of online trust are different across site categories and consumers. Privacy and order fulfillment are the most influential determinants of trust for sites in which both information risk and involvement are high, such as travel sites. Navigation is strongest for information-intensive sites, such as sports, portal, and community sites. Brand strength is critical for high-involvement categories, such as automobile and financial services sites. Online trust partially mediates the relationships between Web site and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent, and this mediation is strongest (weakest) for sites oriented toward infrequently (frequently) purchased, high-involvement items, such as computers (financial services).",0
Which Products Are Best Suited to Mobile Advertising? A Field Study of Mobile Display Advertising Effects on Consumer Attitudes and Intentions,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Mobile advertising is one of the fastest-growing advertising formats. In 2013, global spending on mobile advertising was approximately $16.7 billion, and it is expected to exceed $62.8 billion by 2017. The most prevalent type of mobile advertising is mobile display advertising (MDA), which takes the form of banners on mobile web pages and in mobile applications. This article examines which product characteristics are likely to be associated with MDA campaigns that are effective in increasing consumers? (1) favorable attitudes toward products and (2) purchase intentions. Data from a large-scale test-control field experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010 and involved 39,946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly increased consumers? favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower) involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic). The authors explain this finding using established theories of information processing and persuasion and suggest that when MDAs work effectively, they do so by triggering consumers to recall and process previously stored product information.",1
A Taxonomy and Review of Positive Consumer Dispositions toward Foreign Countries and Globalization,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"International marketing research has shown vivid interest in consumers? positive dispositions toward foreign countries and globalization. Motivated by the aim to segment international consumer markets, the literature has introduced and adopted a plethora of constructs and measurement instruments to capture such dispositions. However, the current state of literature is problematic because of an unsorted range of constructs with overlapping conceptualizations, diverse operationalizations, and fragmented empirical findings regarding the impact of these constructs on consumer responses. Consequently, making an informed choice on which construct(s) to employ in substantive research (and why) is extremely difficult. This article aims to advance the international marketing literature by (1) developing a conceptual taxonomy of constructs of positive consumer dispositions that highlights their similarities and unique features; (2) undertaking a comprehensive review of the relevant conceptualizations and operationalizations; and (3) providing guidance for further research on positive dispositions, including antecedents, response variables, and potential mediating and moderating influences. To move substantive research in this field further, this article also proposes a research framework that comprises antecedents, causal sequences of dispositions, effects on consumer response variables, and potential boundary conditions.",0
"How Critical are Critical Reviews? The Box Office Effects of Film Critics, Star Power, and Budgets",Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors investigate how critics affect the box office performance of films and how the effects may be moderated by stars and budgets. The authors examine the process through which critics affect box office revenue, that is, whether they influence the decision of the film going public (their role as influencers), merely predict the decision (their role as predictors), or do both. They find that both positive and negative reviews are correlated with weekly box office revenue over an eight-week period, suggesting that critics play a dual role: They can influence and predict box office revenue. However, the authors find the impact of negative reviews (but not positive reviews) to diminish over time, a pattern that is more consistent with critics? role as influencers. The authors then compare the positive impact of good reviews with the negative impact of bad reviews to find that film reviews evidence a negativity bias; that is, negative reviews hurt performance more than positive reviews help performance, but only during the first week of a film's run. Finally, the authors examine two key moderators of critical reviews, stars and budgets, and find that popular stars and big budgets enhance box office revenue for films that receive more negative critical reviews than positive critical reviews but do little for films that receive more positive reviews than negative reviews. Taken together, the findings not only replicate and extend prior research on critical reviews and box office performance but also offer insight into how film studios can strategically manage the review process to enhance box office revenue.",0
An Empirical Investigation of Signaling in the Motion Picture Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The contribution of this research lies in the use of real-world data to test several hypotheses about the role of two signals?sequels and advertising expenditures?in the motion picture industry. The authors analyze the data with a dynamic simultaneous-equations model of the drivers and the interrelationships of the behaviors of movie audiences, studios, and exhibitors. Specifically, the authors test for the attenuating role of third-party information sources, such as critics' review consensus and cumulative word of mouth, on the strength of the two aforementioned signals. The authors find evidence of such an effect both at the release phase across movies and over the postrelease phase for any movie. Notably, they hypothesize and show that sequels and advertising expenditures have a positive interaction effect on box office revenues. This is an important finding because though most firms use multiple signals for their products, empirical work on the interaction of two or more signals is rare. This study offers several new and interesting empirical insights into the market dynamics of the motion picture industry.",1
The Impact of Category Management on Retailer Prices and Performance: Theory and Evidence,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Category management (CM) is a recent retail management initiative that aims at improving a retailer's overall performance in a product category through more coordinated buying, merchandising, and pricing of the brands in the category than in the past. Despite tremendous retailer and manufacturer interest in the process of CM and its rapid adoption in the industry, much uncertainty exists about the consequences of CM for channel members. The present study focuses on how a shift to CM by a retailer affects its equilibrium prices, sales, and profitability in a competitive retail setting. On the basis of an analysis of a model of two competing national brand manufacturers that supply two competing common retailers, the authors find that one retailer's adoption of CM increases its average unit price of the category and reduces its sales volume and revenues. However, this retailer can still enjoy an increase in its gross margin profits as competing manufacturers? wholesale prices fall in the process. Also, the CM adopter's profits are greater than those of a symmetric competing retailer that follows the traditional brand-centered management of a product category when the interbrand competition is high but interstore competition is low. Applying the intervention analysis methodology, the authors empirically test several of these analytical findings, employing a unique data set that contains information about a supermarket chain's weekly average unit prices and sales of the laundry detergent category before and after this product category was moved to CM by the retailer. The propositions that adoption of CM will lead to higher retail prices and lower sales are upheld in this empirical study. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for practitioners and researchers, the limitations of the study, and directions for further research.",0
Executive Insights: Marketing Issues and Challenges in Transitional Economies,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Drawing both on the literature as well as field research on companies operating in transitional economies, this article describes the ways in which marketing environments in transitional economies are typically different from those in more developed countries, as well as recent trends in these environments. Managerial implications concerning appropriate marketing strategies and tactics are then drawn, both for multinationals operating in transitional economy markets as well as local companies.",0
Brand Love,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Using a grounded theory approach, the authors investigate the nature and consequences of brand love. Arguing that research on brand love needs to be built on an understanding of how consumers actually experience this phenomenon, they conduct two qualitative studies to uncover the different elements (?features?) of the consumer prototype of brand love. Then, they use structural equations modeling on survey data to explore how these elements can be modeled as both first-order and higher-order structural models. A higher-order model yields seven core elements: self?brand integration, passion-driven behaviors, positive emotional connection, long-term relationship, positive overall attitude valence, attitude certainty and confidence (strength), and anticipated separation distress. In addition to these seven core elements of brand love itself, the prototype includes quality beliefs as an antecedent of brand love and brand loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance to negative information as outcomes. Both the first-order and higher-order brand love models predict loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance better, and provide a greater understanding, than an overall summary measure of brand love. The authors conclude by presenting theoretical and managerial implications.",0
"Integrating Marketing Communications: New Findings, New Lessons, and New Ideas",Journal of Marketing,2016,"With the challenges presented by new media, shifting media patterns, and divided consumer attention, the optimal integration of marketing communications takes on increasing importance. Drawing on a review of relevant academic research and guided by managerial priorities, the authors offer insights and advice as to how traditional and new media such as search, display, mobile, TV, and social media interact to affect consumer decision making. With an enhanced understanding of the consumer decision journey and how consumers process communications, the authors outline a comprehensive framework featuring two models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated marketing communication programs: a ?bottom-up? communications matching model and a ?top-down? communications optimization model. The authors conclude by suggesting important future research priorities.",0
Brand Extension Strategy Planning: Empirical Estimation of Brand?Category Personality Fit and Atypicality,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The majority of brand extensions reportedly fail, suggesting the need for methodologies that allow for better strategic prediction of categories into which a brand should extend or license. Prior literature suggests that brand extensions are likely to be more successful if a brand extends into another category into which its existing brand associations and imagery ?fit? better and if the extending brand is ?atypical? (if it possesses associations and imagery that are broad and abstract rather than tied too closely to the brand's original product category). The authors develop a methodology in this study to estimate brand and category personality structures, using a Bayesian factor model that separates the two by means of brand-level and category-level random effects. This methodology leads to measures of a brand's fit and atypicality. The authors illustrate and validate the model on two nationally representative data sets on brand personalities in three categories (jeans, magazines, and cars) and investigate the brand extension and licensing implications of the results obtained with the model.",1
Positioning Multicountry Brands: The Impact of Variation in Cultural Values and Competitive Set,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Building on cultural values research, the authors identify specific image attributes on which multicountry brands should position themselves consistently across markets. Leveraging prior research, they identify three life values that are most equal (benevolence, universalism, and self-direction) and two that are least equal (power and hedonism) in cross-national importance. The authors link specific brand image attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired worldwide. They also find that the attitudinal impact of a multicountry brand's positioning consistency on commonly valued image attributes is greater when the set of competitors the brand faces across its markets is more homogeneous. The authors discuss implications for global brand management theory and practice.",1
The Structural Influence of Marketing Journals: A Citation Analysis of the Discipline and its Subareas over Time,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors investigate the overall and subarea influence of a comprehensive set of marketing and marketing-related journals at three points in time during a 30-year period using a citation-based measure of structural influence. The results show that a few journals wield a disproportionate amount of influence in the marketing journal network as a whole and that influential journals tend to derive their influence from many different journals. Different journals are most influential in different subareas of marketing; general business and managerially oriented journals have lost influence, whereas more specialized marketing journals have gained in influence over time. The Journal of Marketing emerges as the most influential marketing journal in the final period (1996?97) and as the journal with the broadest span of influence across all subareas. Yet the Journal of Marketing is notably influential among applied marketing journals, which themselves are of lesser influence. The index of structural influence is significantly correlated with other objective and subjective measures of influence but least so with the impact factors reported in the Social Sciences Citation Index. Overall, the findings demonstrate the rapid maturation of the marketing discipline and the changing role of key journals in the process.",0
Response Styles in Marketing Research: A Cross-National Investigation,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Response styles are a source of contamination in questionnaire ratings, and therefore they threaten the validity of conclusions drawn from marketing research data. In this article, the authors examine five forms of stylistic responding (acquiescence and disacquiescence response styles, extreme response style/response range, midpoint responding, and noncontingent responding) and discuss their biasing effects on scale scores and correlations between scales. Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.",1
An Extended Paradigm for Measurement Analysis of Marketing Constructs Applicable to Panel Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In an effort to advance measurement analysis in marketing research, the authors propose three extensions of the current scale development paradigm. First, the authors focus attention on the trait-state distinction and present a model that separates stable sources of substantive variation in a construct from transient sources. Second, the authors develop a classification of measurement error that distinguishes six types of error on the basis of (1) whether the error is stable or transient and (2) whether the error affects individual items, subsets of items, or all items in a scale. They also show how these errors can be modeled using a factor-analytic specification. Third, the authors argue that marketing researchers should make the means of scale items an explicit component of measurement analysis and should test for the invariance of item loadings and intercepts as a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of scale means across samples and over time. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed procedure, the authors present an extended application of the model to the constructs of brand loyalty and deal proneness.",1
"Misresponse to Survey Questions: A Conceptual Framework and Empirical Test of the Effects of Reversals, Negations, and Polar Opposite Core Concepts",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors propose a conceptual framework of misresponse to multi-item scales in surveys in which misresponse to items that are reversed relative to other items (reversal misresponse) is differentiated from misresponse to items that are negated (negation misresponse) and from misresponse to items whose core concept is the opposite of the core concept in regular items (polar opposite misresponse). The framework specifies two broad mechanisms to account for the three forms of misresponse: lack of motivation to process items in detail (?inattention?) and lack of ability to comprehend items accurately (?difficulty?). The authors propose a procedure to identify potential misresponse effects on the observed item responses and factor loadings, and they report two empirical studies to test the framework; the second study uses eye movement recordings to examine the underlying process. The findings reveal that polar opposite, reversed, and negated items contribute to misresponse to varying degrees and that difficulty rather than inattention may be a more potent cause of misresponse in surveys than has traditionally been acknowledged.",1
Do Disclosures of Customer Metrics Lower Investors? and Analysts? Uncertainty but Hurt Firm Performance?,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Investors, analysts, and regulators frequently advocate greater disclosure of nonfinancial information, such as customer metrics. Managers, however, argue that such metrics are costly to report, reveal sensitive information to competitors, and therefore will lower future cash flows. To examine these counterarguments, this study presents the first empirical examination of the prevalence and consequences of backward- and forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics by manually coding 511 annual reports of firms in two industries, telecommunications (365 reports) and airlines (146 reports). The results reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries, firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures. Notably, forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics are negatively associated with investors? uncertainty in both industries and with analysts? uncertainty in the telecommunications industry. Importantly, the results do not support the managerial thesis that such disclosures have a negative impact on future cash flows.",1
Truth or Consequences: An Analysis of Vaporware and New Product Announcements,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The software industry practice of announcing new products well in advance of actual market availability has led to allegations that firms are intentionally engaging in vaporware. The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and that intentional vaporware can deter entry. The authors also show that there is a curvilinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy; that is, firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, whereas firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data. Finally, the authors discuss the beneficial and harmful consequences of vaporware and the associated implications.",1
The Characteristics of Joint Ventures in the People's Republic of China,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This paper compares the characteristics of international equity joint ventures in the People's Republic of China (PRC) with joint ventures in developing country market economies. The characteristics of Sino-foreign joint ventures were derived from twelve studies published since 1986, including the author's new sample. Twelve joint venture characteristics are reviewed along dimensions of design, management and performance.Joint ventures in PRC are frequently used, created due to government pressure and with government partners, and often formed with partners from ethnically related countries. Further, many intended joint ventures are never implemented, and those that are implemented have often been set up for a predetermined duration. The foreign partner most commonly has a minority equity position, and those who have used split control have seen stronger performance. Overall joint venture stability has been high, but is expected to decline, and foreign partner satisfaction with performance is low.",0
Service Satisfaction?Market Share Relationships in Partnered Hybrid Offerings,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Many goods manufacturers and service providers jointly deliver partnered hybrid offerings to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance. In such cases, service providers may emphasize different aspects of service in their offerings. Do service providers and goods manufacturers benefit equally from emphasizing service satisfaction? Do the performance effects of emphases on different aspects of service satisfaction vary across different goods? The authors examine the effects of emphases on two aspects of service satisfaction, relational service (interactions with the service provider's staff) and service environment (service provider's facilities), on the market shares of service and goods components of partnered hybrid offerings. Using multiple secondary data sources from the U.S. automobile industry between 2009 and 2015, the authors find that emphasizing relational service satisfaction increases service market share but decreases goods market share. Counterintuitively, emphasizing service environment satisfaction decreases service market share. Furthermore, the vertical quality of the good moderates these relationships. The findings generate actionable guidelines to improve market shares by adjusting relational service satisfaction and service environment satisfaction in the partnered hybrid offerings context.",0
The Impact of the Prechoice Process on Product Returns,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"This article introduces a framework to help researchers understand the mechanisms underlying product returns. The framework draws on research in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus non-comparative nature of thoughts generated influences their diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.",1
Understanding Relationship Marketing and Loyalty Program Effectiveness in Global Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Relationship marketing (RM) and loyalty programs (LPs) are key differentiation strategies for firms facing increasing global competition. Accordingly, global interest in RM and LPs has surged, though researchers examining these marketing activities typically apply U.S.-centric frameworks to international research contexts. To understand how RM and LPs may be influenced by factors that distinguish global markets, this review offers a comprehensive framework of both RM and LP mechanisms and considers how cultural and developmental contingency factors may alter the effects of these mechanisms on seller performance. The results from this review produce eight propositions about where specific RM and LP strategies should be most effective. By considering these mechanisms jointly, the authors also simultaneously delineate RM and LP theories and broaden the scope of global research in both domains.",0
Does It Pay to Be Real? Understanding Authenticity in TV Advertising,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Marketing managers and creatives alike believe that authenticity is an essential element for effective advertising. However, no common understanding of authenticity in advertising exists, and empirical knowledge about its impact on consumer behavior is limited. In this study, the authors use a comprehensive literature review and qualitative studies to identify four dimensions of authenticity in an advertising context. By examining 323 television ads across 67 brands and four years, they investigate these dimensions? effects on the sales performance of advertised products. Because the impact of authenticity may depend on brand or product characteristics, the authors also analyze how these effects vary with brand size or across hedonic and utilitarian products. The results suggest that authenticity influences consumer behavior in a more nuanced manner than previously recognized. For instance, whereas an ad congruent with the brand?s essence has a positive effect on sales in most cases, an overly honest advertising message can actually hurt performance; the latter is true especially for hedonic products, for which consumers rely more on subjective information when making purchase decisions.",0
A Cross-Cultural Examination of Corporate Social Responsibility Marketing Communications in Mexico and the United States: Strategies for Global Brands,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This study examines the impact of marketing-oriented corporate social responsibility (CSR) communications on perceptions of the firm and its brands among consumers in two diverse cultures, economies, and political landscapes. The authors? main hypotheses are based on global brand positioning theory, which posits that consumer perceptions are enhanced if the brand is viewed as global. In general, the results support the notion that multinational firms emphasizing global CSR efforts engender more positive perceptions across multiple dimensions. Yet regarding tactical issues, the results also show the importance of some specific needs according to local tastes and experiences. The authors provide implications for marketing theory and practice as well as future research directions.",0
Overcoming Institutional and Infrastructure Weaknesses in China via Online Third-Party Marketplaces,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"China is the world?s second largest retail market and is expected to surpass the United States in 2020. This makes China a must-win market for global and local firms. However, manufacturers often find it hard to reach Chinese consumers due to China?s institutional and infrastructure weaknesses. The advent of online third-party marketplaces provides manufacturers with a new model to tackle these challenges. The question remains, however, whether and to what extent joining online third-party marketplaces in China can generate market value. Using an event study methodology, the authors assess the net impact of online marketplace adoption in China on manufacturers? expected profitability. Although the abnormal returns are, on average, significant and positive, stock markets recognize that not all manufacturers can reap benefits. To delve deeper into this variation, the authors relate the abnormal returns to various sources of manufacturers? market knowledge and marketing capabilities. They find that less diversified manufacturers with marketplace experience are expected to achieve greater gains, irrespective of their origin. However, the effects of marketing strengths diverge for foreign and local firms.",0
The Best of Both Worlds? Effects of Attribute-Induced Goal Conflict on Consumption of Healthful Indulgences,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Marketers commonly assume that health claims attached to otherwise unhealthful food stimulate consumption because such claims offer justification for indulgence and reduce guilt. This article proposes a generalized theory of healthful indulgences, identifying when and why people overconsume versus regulate food intake in response to health claims. Four studies demonstrate that not all health claims are created equal. The authors suggest that the nature of the food attributes the claims emphasize?namely, functional versus hedonic?determines the extent of consumption of the indulgence. Health claims featuring functional attributes (e.g., ?extra antioxidants?) trigger high levels of health-goal accessibility, which, together with simultaneously accessible indulgence goals attached to the indulgence, results in goal conflict. This conflict leads to reduced consumption of the food. In contrast, health claims featuring hedonic attributes (e.g., ?low fat?) render health goals less accessible while accentuating the pleasure dimension of the food, resulting in lower goal conflict and increased consumption of the food. Implications for the food industry and public policy makers are discussed.",1
Recovering Stockkeeping-Unit-Level Preferences and Response Sensitivities from Market Share Models Estimated on Item Aggregates,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors propose a new approach to obtaining stockkeeping-unit (SKU)-level preferences and response sensitivities. The authors distinguish an attribute-level model, in which the unit of analysis is the market share for an alternative created by aggregation (e.g., Colgate toothpaste), from a truly disaggregate SKU-level model, and they establish an analytical relationship between parameters that they obtain from the two models. The authors show that SKU-level parameters can be recovered by calculation from estimated attribute-level parameters, circumventing the need for direct estimation of the more complex SKU-level model. They calibrate the store data market share model using 98 weeks of data for ten brands and 168 SKUs of toothpaste. Rather than estimate 168 preference parameters (when there is an ?outside? alternative in addition to the 168 ?inside? ones), it is only necessary to estimate ten brand-preference parameters from which the 168 parameters can be computed, as long as share and marketing-mix data are available at the SKU level. Covariate effects, such as marketing-mix response parameters, can be recovered in a similar fashion. Holdout tests demonstrate superior predictive performance, and the authors discuss implications for the derivation of elasticities for new SKU introductions.",1
From Point of Purchase to Path to Purchase: How Preshopping Factors Drive Unplanned Buying,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Many retailers believe that a majority of purchases are unplanned, so they spend heavily on in-store marketing to stimulate these types of purchases. At the same time, the effects of ?preshopping? factors?the shoppers? overall trip goals, store-specific shopping objectives, and prior marketing exposures?are largely unexplored. The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to ?hold the shopper constant? while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more unplanned buying from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Store-linked goals also affect unplanned buying; unplanned buying is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in unplanned buying from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store. The authors discuss the implications for retailers.",0
Price Competition under Stockpiling and Flexible Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Conventional wisdom suggests that the main effect of price promotion is on brand switching (i.e., secondary demand); however, some recent studies demonstrate that the primary demand expansion effect can be considerably larger than previously believed. A significant driver of this primary demand effect is consumer stockpiling in response to price promotions. Indeed, experimental studies have shown that additional inventory on hand can lead to an endogenous increase in consumption. The authors develop a model of price competition between firms in response to the stockpiling and subsequent consumption dynamics of consumers. In this setting, the flexible consumption effect causes more intense price competition, deeper promotions, and an increase in the frequency of promotions. The authors use two years of scanner panel data from eight product categories and 4313 stockkeeping units to test three implications of the theoretical model; they find strong support for each.",1
?Be Careless with That!? Availability of Product Upgrades Increases Cavalier Behavior toward Possessions,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Consumers are often faced with the opportunity to purchase a new, enhanced product, such as a new phone, even though the product they currently own is still fully functional. The authors propose that consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the presence of appealing, though not yet attained, product upgrades (not just mere replacements). Carelessness and neglect toward currently owned products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades without appearing wasteful. A series of studies with actual owners of a wide range of different goods (durable, consumable, functional, and hedonic products) and evidence from a real-word data set of lost Apple iPhones demonstrate how the availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that product neglect in the presence of attractive upgrades can occur without deliberate intentions. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.",1
Does Accommodating a Self-Serving Partner in an International Marketing Alliance Pay Off?,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research examines a firm's performance in an international marketing alliance when it responds to a self-serving partner's exploitive behavior with accommodation, a cooperative response motivated by the firm's commitment to the venture. The authors theorize that a wronged firm's payoff from accommodation depends on its approach to monitoring, either employing overt surveillance or relying on its partner's self-control. Overt surveillance is believed to undermine accommodation's ability to convince a selfish partner that cooperation is beneficial and not inconsistent with its self-interest. In contrast, because no or low monitoring is a relational approach to evaluation, it tends to reinforce accommodation, persuading a competitive partner to reciprocate cooperatively. Data collected from 174 international marketing alliances support the authors? prediction that under low monitoring, accommodation is positively associated with performance in the alliance. Unexpectedly, under high monitoring, performance is greatest under both low and high accommodation. An explanation may lie in accommodation theory's notion that as accommodation increases, a selfish partner transitions from competition to cooperation, ceasing to exploit accommodation and upturning performance.",0
A Multiple-Item Model of Paired Comparisons: Separating Chance from Latent Preference,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors develop a flexible model to analyze relative preference scores: the binomial/Dirichlet model. This model assumes that (1) individual respondents make independent draws from binomial distributions when stating their preferences and (2) the latent (unobserved) preference parameters vary across respondents according to a Dirichlet distribution. Through the analysis of 44 tests that include from two to five products each, the authors show that the model fits the data relatively well. A multinomial/Dirichlet extension of the model that applies to repeat preference tests of two items provides a better fit than an alternative mixture model despite fewer parameters. To test two items and obtain an accuracy of +.05 with a 95% confidence interval for the mean preference intensities, a multinomial/Dirichlet model requires two paired comparisons (made at two points in time) per respondent and a sample size of 400; these requirements represent half the required number of preference measurements per respondent and half the required sample size of alternative methods. Although the illustrative examples refer to the comparison of known brands and unidentified products, the proposed methodology can be applied to many contexts, including the evaluation of product profiles in conjoint analysis.",1
Managing Business-to-Business Customer Relationships following Key Contact Employee Turnover in a Vendor Firm,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Customers form relationships with the employees who serve them as well as with the vendor firms these employees represent. In many cases, a customer's relationship with an employee who is closest to them, a key contact employee, may be stronger than the customer's relationship with the vendor firm. If the key contact employee is no longer available to serve that customer, the vendor firm's relationship with the customer may become vulnerable. In this article, the authors present the results of two studies that examine what business-to-business customers value in their relationships with key contact employees, what customers' concerns are when a favored key contact employee is no longer available to serve them, and what vendor firms can do to alleviate these concerns and to retain employee knowledge even if they cannot retain the employee in that position. The studies are based on a discovery-oriented approach and integrate input from business-to-business customers, key contact employees, and managers from a broad cross-section of companies to develop testable propositions. The authors discuss managerial and theoretical implications and directions for further research.",0
Psychological Implications of Customer Participation in Co-Production,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Customer participation in the production of goods and services appears to be growing. The marketing literature has largely focused on the economic implications of this trend and has not addressed customers? potential psychological responses to participation. The authors draw on the social psychological literature on the self-serving bias and conduct two studies to examine the effects of participation on customer satisfaction. Study 1 shows that consistent with the self-serving bias, given an identical outcome, customer satisfaction with a firm differs depending on whether a customer participates in production. Study 2 shows that providing customers a choice in whether to participate mitigates the self-serving bias when the outcome is worse than expected. The authors present theoretical and practical implications and provide directions for further research.",0
Share Repurchases and Myopia: Implications on the Stock and Consumer Markets,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Investor demand has promoted share repurchases to the dominating payout instrument for U.S. firms. However, critics worry that the repurchase boom leads to firms neglecting long-term investments. Even worse, scholars have shown that investor pressure also motivates firms to cut marketing investments with the aim of boosting short-term income, a practice called myopic marketing management. Extant theory still lacks an understanding of whether and how the co-occurrence of share repurchases and myopic marketing affects firm stakeholders such as investors and consumers. Using a large-scale cross-industry sample, the authors reveal that there is a higher share of firms cutting marketing investments among repurchasing firms than among nonrepurchasing firms. Furthermore, investors immediately respond negatively to myopic firms that also repurchase shares. Finally, repurchases and myopic marketing are also associated with an increase in product recalls. This first study to assess share repurchases through a marketing lens hence reveals negative effects on both the stock and the consumer markets.",0
Foreign Market Servicing: Beyond Choice of Entry Mode,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"This article focuses on the operation method (or entry mode) that a company utilizes in developing its involvement in a foreign market. An overview and critique of ?economics? and ?process? approaches to this issue is undertaken. It is argued that both approaches use relatively constrained frameworks of influences on mode choice, and have yet to come to terms with the frequent reality of operation modes in combination. Methodological and conceptual issues arising out of the analysis are considered as a basis for moving forward the research in this area.",0
Corporate Associations and Consumer Product Responses: The Moderating Role of Corporate Brand Dominance,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This study investigates the effect of corporate brand dominance?that is, the visibility of a company's corporate brand in product communications?on the relationship between corporate associations and product evaluations. The results show that corporate brand dominance determines the degree to which associations with the company's corporate ability and corporate social responsibility influence product attitudes, as well as the nature of the moderating effects of fit and involvement.",0
"Dogs on the Street, Pumas on Your Feet: How Cues in the Environment Influence Product Evaluation and Choice",Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Little empirical research has examined the implicit effects of environmental cues on consumer behavior. Across six studies using a combination of field and laboratory methods, the authors find that products are more accessible, evaluated more favorably, and chosen more frequently when the surrounding environment contains more perceptually or conceptually related cues. The findings highlight the impact of frequent?in addition to recent?priming in shaping product evaluation and choice: More frequent exposure to perceptually or conceptually related cues increases product accessibility and makes the product easier to process. In turn, this increased accessibility influences product evaluation and choice, which are found to vary directly with the frequency of exposure to conceptually related cues. These results support the hypothesis that conceptual priming effects can have a strong impact on real-world consumer judgments.",1
Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.",0
What Makes Online Content Viral?,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Why are certain pieces of online content (e.g., advertisements, videos, news articles) more viral than others? This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.",1
What Drives Immediate and Ongoing Word of Mouth?,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Word of mouth (WOM) affects diffusion and sales, but why are certain products talked about more than others, both right after consumers first experience them and in the months that follow? This article examines psychological drivers of immediate and ongoing WOM. The authors analyze a unique data set of everyday conversations for more than 300 products and conduct both a large field experiment across various cities and a controlled laboratory experiment with real conversations. The results indicate that more interesting products get more immediate WOM but, contrary to intuition, do not receive more ongoing WOM over multiple months or overall. In contrast, products that are cued more by the environment or are more publicly visible receive more WOM both right away and over time. Additional analyses demonstrate which promotional giveaways in WOM marketing campaigns are associated with increased WOM. overall, the findings shed light on psychological drivers of WOM and provide insight into designing more effective WOM campaigns.",1
The Predictive Validity of Multiple-Item versus Single-Item Measures of the Same Constructs,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This study compares the predictive validity of single-item and multiple-item measures of attitude toward the ad (AAd) and attitude toward the brand (ABrand), which are two of the most widely measured constructs in marketing. The authors assess the ability of AAd to predict ABrand in copy tests of four print advertisements for diverse new products. There is no difference in the predictive validity of the multiple-item and single-item measures. The authors conclude that for the many constructs in marketing that consist of a concrete singular object and a concrete attribute, such as AAd or ABrand, single-item measures should be used.",1
The Braggart's Dilemma: On the Social Rewards and Penalties of Advertising Prosocial Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"People often brag about, or advertise, their good deeds to others. Seven studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help?and often hurts?when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, bragging about personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism.",1
Expense Neglect in Forecasting Personal Finances,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This article examines how consumers forecast their future spare money, or ?financial slack.? Although consumers generally think that both their income and expenses will rise in the future, they underweight the extent to which their expected expenses will cut into their spare money, a phenomenon the authors term ?expense neglect.? The authors test and rule out several possible explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that expense neglect is due in part to insufficient attention toward expectations about future expenses relative to future income. ?Tightwad? consumers, who are chronically attuned to costs, show less severe expense neglect than ?spendthrifts,? who are less attuned to costs. The authors further find that expectations regarding changes in income (and not changes in expenses) predict responses to the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, a leading macroeconomic indicator. Finally, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of their entire file drawer (27 studies, 8,418 participants) and find that (1) across studies, participants place 2.9 times greater weight on income change than they do on expense change when forecasting changes in their financial slack, and (2) expense neglect is stronger for distant than for near-future forecasts.",1
A Tale of Two Twitterspheres: Political Microblogging During and After the 2016 Primary and Presidential Debates,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In this research, the authors study the process by which social media posts are created and shared during live political debates. Using data from over 9.5 million tweets posted during and shortly after four key debates leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the authors test a series of hypotheses about how tweeting evolves over time during such events. They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the ?Twittersphere? became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event. Evidence for the generalizability of the findings is provided by an analysis of Barack Obama?s last State of the Union Address, where similar dynamics are observed.",1
Executive Insights: Roles of R&D and Manufacturing in Global Marketing Management,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"In today's world of global competition and high-speed product development, linkage among R&D, manufacturing, and marketing is more vital to successful business than ever before. Delivering a competitive product to the market at the right time, with the right specifications and feature benefits, all at a manufacturing cost that allows for profit, is one tough assignment. Add to this the global complexity of marketing, R&D, and manufacturing not being located in the same place, along with competing in an environment where world-class product development time is under 50 weeks, and you have a challenge that few companies are dealing with appropriately today.International marketing executives can no longer have the luxury of time to consider R&D and manufacturing as activities remotely related and remotely relevant to them. They have to deal with all of this complexity and be fully aware that without adequate understanding of the linkages necessary among marketing, R&D, and manufacturing, their businesses run a very high risk of failure (Kotabe 1992). Based on my executive experience at three different companies, I have seen the same lingering problems. In this article, I will explore the essence of these problems and solutions based on my own experiences.",0
Understanding Service Convenience,Journal of Marketing,2002,"The subject of service convenience is important in service economies, yet little is known about this topic. The consumer convenience literature?strong in certain respects, underdeveloped in other respects?gives insufficient attention to service convenience. The prevailing pattern is either to treat service convenience generally or to lump services and goods together into an overall convenience construct. The authors seek to stimulate a higher level of research activity and dialogue by proposing a more comprehensive and multidimensional conceptualization of service convenience and a model delineating its antecedents and consequences. The authors build their case by systematically examining the convenience literature, explicating the dimensions and types of service convenience, developing the overall model and related research propositions, and presenting directions for further research.",0
Executive Insights: Virtual Services Go International: International Services in the Marketspace,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"The Web overcomes many of the traditional problems inherent in the marketing of international services. In this new era of cyberservice, marketing managers must reappraise their approach to marketing services in general and international services in particular. The defining characteristics of services?intangibility, simultaneity, heterogeneity, and perishability?are a service marketing challenge but can be managed successfully, because the Web is an outstanding tool for mass customization that combines the best of mass production and customization. The authors use a series of exemplary cases to illustrate how international firms can use the Web to enhance the marketing of services across national boundaries. They offer a diagnostic checklist that can be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of a firm's Web site in providing international services.",0
Carbon Footprinting and Pricing Under Climate Concerns,Journal of Marketing,2020,"This article studies how organizations should design a product by choosing the carbon footprint and price in a market with climate concerns. The authors first show how the cost and demand effects of reducing the product carbon footprint determine the profit-maximizing design. Paradoxically, they find that stronger climate concerns may increase the overall corporate carbon footprint, even if the product itself is greener. Next, the authors establish that offsetting carbon emissions can create a win-win outcome for the firm and the climate if the cost of compensation is sufficiently low. Third, the authors show how regulation in the form of a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax affects product design, firm profitability, and green technology adoption. Finally, the authors extend the analysis to a competitive scenario. Overall, these results can help marketing professionals by offering insight into how to address climate concerns through improved product design.",0
The Discriminating Consumer: Product Proliferation and Willingness to Pay for Quality,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors propose that a crowded product space motivates consumers to better discriminate between options of different quality. Specifically, this article reports evidence from three controlled experiments and one natural experiment that people are prepared to pay more for high-quality products and less for low-quality products when they are considered in the context of a dense, as opposed to a sparse, set of alternatives. To explain this effect, the authors argue that consumers uncertain about the importance of quality learn from observing market outcomes. Product proliferation reveals that other consumers care to discriminate among similar alternatives, and in turn, this inference raises the importance of quality in decision making.",1
Cross-Category Effects of Aisle and Display Placements: A Spatial Modeling Approach and Insights,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Amid growing competition, retailers are increasingly interested in more effective aisle and display management strategies. These strategies involve placements of product categories in aisles and displays within each store to facilitate greater sales affinity (demand attraction) between categories to improve the store's share of customer wallet. The authors investigate the effects of aisle and display placements on the sales affinities between categories. They develop a spatial model of brand sales that allows for asymmetric store-specific affinity effects between two or more categories, while controlling for the effects of traditional merchandising and marketing-mix variables, such as price, feature, and display. They estimate the model on aggregate store-level data for regular cola and regular potato chip categories for a major retail chain, using hierarchical Bayesian methods. They show the usefulness and extension potential of the model through simulation of aisle placements for a third category. The results show that aisle and display placements have significant and sizable asymmetric effects on cross-category sales affinities comparable to those influenced by marketing-mix variables. Retail managers can use this detailed store-level model and subsequent insights to develop customized aisle and display management for their individual stores.",0
"What is Special about Marketing Organic Products? How Organic Assortment, Price, and Promotions Drive Retailer Performance",Journal of Marketing,2013,"Higher sales and margins are key goals for retailers promoting emerging products, such as organics, but little is known about their marketing effectiveness and their cross-effects on conventional product sales. Extant research reports conflicting results about price and promotional sensitivity for organic products and does not address the impact of organic assortment. This article calculates long-term own- and cross-elasticities of organic and conventional product sales in response to changes in assortment, price, and promotions. Using a rich data set of 56 categories, the authors test hypotheses on how different costs and benefits of organic products affect these elasticities. They find that enduring actions, such as assortment and regular price changes, have a higher elasticity for organics than for conventional products. In contrast with common wisdom, even ?core? organic consumers are sensitive to these actions. Increasing organic assortment and promotion breadth yields higher profits for the total category, as do more frequent promotions on conventional products. The category comparison yields specific advice with regard to where larger assortment and lower prices versus more and deeper promotions are most effective.",0
Corporate Sociopolitical Activism and Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Stakeholders have long pressured firms to provide societal benefits in addition to generating shareholder wealth. Such benefits have traditionally come in the form of corporate social responsibility. However, many stakeholders now expect firms to demonstrate their values by expressing public support for or opposition to one side of a partisan sociopolitical issue, a phenomenon the authors call ?corporate sociopolitical activism? (CSA). Such activities differ from commonly favored corporate social responsibility and have the potential to both strengthen and sever stakeholder relationships, thus making their impact on firm value uncertain. Using signaling and screening theories, the authors analyze 293 CSA events initiated by 149 firms across 39 industries, and find that, on average, CSA elicits an adverse reaction from investors. Investors evaluate CSA as a signal of a firm?s allocation of resources away from profit-oriented objectives and toward a risky activity with uncertain outcomes. The authors further identify two sets of moderators: (1) CSA?s deviation from key stakeholders? values and brand image and (2) characteristics of CSA?s resource implementation, which affect investor and customer responses. The findings provide new and important implications for marketing theory and practice.",0
Satisfaction (Mis)pricing Revisited: Real? Really Big?,Journal of Marketing,2016,"The question of whether customer satisfaction is mispriced by the stock market has been debated over the past decade, yet it remains unintegrated with the broader asset pricing literature. The authors critique Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), focusing on that article's missed opportunities in addressing theoretical lacuna and empirical challenges that might establish the satisfaction mispricing anomaly. In doing so, they distinguish mispricing from value relevance, classify two broad avenues for satisfaction mispricing research, and detail the scope of future research under each avenue. They conclude by summarizing specific research opportunities and presenting implications for managers, investors, and educators that could lead marketing to become a net contributor to the marketing?finance dialogue.",0
The Impact of Brand Quality on Shareholder Wealth,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This study examines the impact of brand quality on three components of shareholder wealth: stock returns, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. The study finds that brand quality enhances shareholder wealth insofar as unanticipated changes in brand quality are positively associated with stock returns and negatively related to changes in idiosyncratic risk. However, unanticipated changes in brand quality can also erode shareholder wealth because they have a positive association with changes in systematic risk. The study introduces a contingency theory view to the marketing?finance interface by analyzing the moderating role of two factors that are widely followed by investors. The results show an unanticipated increase (decrease) in current-period earnings enhances (depletes) the positive impact of unanticipated changes in brand quality on stock returns and mitigates (enhances) their deleterious effects on changes in systematic risk. Similarly, brand quality is more valuable for firms facing increasing competition (i.e., unanticipated decreases in industry concentration). The results are robust to endogeneity concerns and across alternative models. The authors conclude by discussing the nuanced implications of their findings for shareholder wealth, reporting brand quality to investors, and its use in employee evaluation.",0
Sales Force Compensation Design for Two-Sided Market Platforms,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors study the use of sales agents for network mobilization in a two-sided market platform that connects buyers and sellers, and they examine how the presence of direct and indirect network effects influences the design of the sales compensation plan. They employ a principal?agent model in which the firm tasks sales agents to mobilize the side of the platform that it monetizes (i.e., sellers). Specifically, the presence of network effects alters the agency relationship between the firm and the sales agent, requiring the platform firm to alter the compensation design, and the nature of the alteration depends on whether the network effects are direct or indirect and positive or negative. The authors first show how the agent?s compensation plan should account for different types of network effects. They then establish that when the platform firm compensates the agent solely on the basis of network mobilization on the side cultivated by the agent (sellers), as intuition would suggest, it will not fully capitalize on the advantage of positive network effects; that is, profit can be lower under stronger network effects. To overcome this limitation, the platform should link the agent?s pay to a second metric, specifically, network mobilization on the buyer side, even though the agent is not assigned to that side. This design induces a positive relation between the strength of network effects and profit. This research underlines the complexity and richness of network effects and provides managers with new insights regarding the design of sales agents? compensation plans for platforms.",1
The Cue-of-the-Cloud Effect: When Reminders of Online Information Availability Increase Purchase Intentions and Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"In offline purchasing settings (e.g., retail stores), consumers often encounter reminders that product information can be found on the Internet. The authors refer to a reminder of the availability of online information as a ?cue-of-the-cloud? and explore its unique consequences on offline consumer behavior. This research finds that when consumers are presented with relatively large amounts of information in offline purchasing situations, a cue-of-the-cloud can enhance purchase intentions and choice behaviors. This occurs because the cue increases consumers? confidence in being able to retain and access the information seen in-store, which engenders positive feelings about the decision to purchase. Four studies, including two experiments in real brick-and-mortar field settings, demonstrate the consequences of a cue-of-the-cloud, along with some novel moderators of these effects.",1
Customer Satisfaction and Firm Profits in Monopolies: A Study of Utilities,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"There is a growing body of evidence that customer satisfaction is predictive of firms? future financial performance. However, studies of this relationship have been limited to competitive markets, and monopolistic markets have been largely ignored. This study explores the large and important utilities market and exploits its unique regulatory requirements that generate detailed and reliable operating and accounting data to examine the overall relationship between customer satisfaction and utility profit and establish the causal mechanisms involved. Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and cooperation from customers. This study has important implications for both managers and regulators and provides important new insights for market-based asset theory and regulatory economic theory.",1
Consumer?Company Identification: A Framework for Understanding Consumers? Relationships with Companies,Journal of Marketing,2003,"In this article, the authors try to determine why and under what conditions consumers enter into strong, committed, and meaningful relationships with certain companies, becoming champions of these companies and their products. Drawing on theories of social identity and organizational identification, the authors propose that strong consumer?company relationships often result from consumers? identification with those companies, which helps them satisfy one or more important self-definitional needs. The authors elaborate on the nature of consumer?company identification, including the company identity, and articulate a consumer-level conceptual framework that offers propositions regarding the key determinants and consequences of such identification in the marketplace.",0
The Influence of Corporate Messages on the Product Portfolio,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The authors examine factors that change the influence of corporate messages for forming judgments about products in the company's portfolio (i.e., transfer). Corporate messages transferred more than a product message onto other products in the company's portfolio. However, a product message had more influence than corporate messages for that product. Moreover, a corporate ability (quality) message transferred more to the portfolio than did a corporate social responsibility message. Finally, a competitive product message that preceded a company product message and was positioned similarly to a company product lessened corporate message diagnosticity, reducing transfer. However, this occurred only for a product in the same category but not for a product in a different one. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for corporate brand and product brand managers and suggest directions for further research.",0
New Empirical Generalizations on the Determinants of Price Elasticity,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The importance of pricing decisions for firms has fueled an extensive stream of research on price elasticities. In an influential meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories, and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81 studies, the average price elasticity is ?2.62. A salient finding is that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price elasticities. A striking null result is that accounting for heterogeneity does not affect elasticities significantly. The authors also present an analysis that explains the difference between their findings and Tellis's findings, and they indicate which new price elasticity studies are most desirable.",1
Looming Losses in Future Time Perception,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"It is proposed that a future time interval's perceived length will be affected by whether the interval ends with a gain or loss. Confirming this, several experiments indicate that consumers perceive intervals ending with losses as shorter than equivalent intervals ending with gains. The authors explore the mechanisms underlying these effects, and they identify several parallels between the current effects and loss aversion. The authors further show that these changes in time perception influence consumption decisions, and they consider the implications of the findings for theories of time perception and intertemporal choice.",1
Customer Clusters as Sources of Innovation-Based Competitive Advantage,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"The authors examine the effect of customer clusters on a firm's innovation. They argue that knowledge leveraged from customer clusters can help the firm develop innovations. The authors specifically concentrate on the effect of a firm's geographical proximity and diversity of customer clusters on innovation outcomes. In addition to showing the importance of customer cluster proximity on firm innovation, they explore the effect of customer cluster heterogeneity on innovation in an international marketing environment. They test the theoretical model using multicountry data (N = 288) drawn from the U.K. innovation survey implemented by the Economic and Social Research Council, which collected the data across five European countries. Theoretical constructs operate largely as hypothesized and explain a substantial proportion of the variation in the different innovation outcomes tested.",0
The Effect of Superstar Software on Hardware Sales in System Markets,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Systems are composed of complementary products (e.g., video game systems are composed of the video game console and video games). Prior literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as ?hardware?) largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often referred to as ?software?). Mathematical and empirical analyses have almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence, case illustrations show that certain high-quality, ?superstar? software titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales by an average of 14% (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the hardware required to use the software. Software type does not consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase hardware sales. Hardware firms? exclusivity over superstars does not provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.",0
Consumer Evaluations of Sale Prices: Role of the Subtraction Principle,Journal of Marketing,2013,"How exactly does the display location of a sale price relative to the original price affect consumers? evaluations? Across multiple studies, including field studies with actual choices and studies with nonstudent samples, this article shows that consumer evaluations are a function of the display location of the sale price, but such evaluations are moderated by discount depth. First, presenting the smaller number to the right (vs. left) makes it easier to initiate the subtraction task, a phenomenon the authors refer to as the ?subtraction principle.? Second, given that evaluating sale prices inherently involves a subtraction task, locating sale prices to the right (vs. left) of the original price facilitates calculation of discount depth, increasing evaluations for moderate discounts but not for low discounts. These effects are potentially reversed in cases of both very low discounts and exaggerated discounts. The findings in this article offer novel and nonintuitive insights into how sale price display locations and discount depth interact to influence numerical cognitions, processing of sale prices, and subsequent evaluations.",0
How the Order of Sampled Experiential Products Affects Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The results of five experiments reveal that when sampling a series of experiential products (e.g., beverages, music), consumers prefer the product sampled second in a series of two desirable products but relatively prefer the product sampled first in a series of two undesirable products. The underlying process for both outcomes is a recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two desirable products). However, the preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product holds only if there is no time delay between the sampling of the products or between the sampling and the choice evaluations.",1
"Making Choices While Smelling, Tasting, and Listening: The Role of Sensory (Dis)similarity When Sequentially Sampling Products",Journal of Marketing,2014,"Marketers are increasingly allowing consumers to sample sensory-rich experiential products before making purchase decisions. The results of seven experimental studies (two conducted in field settings, three conducted in a laboratory, and two conducted online) demonstrate that the order in which consumers sample products and the level of (dis)similarity between the sensory cues of the products influence choices. In the absence of any moderators, when sampling a sequence of sensory-rich experiential products (e.g., fragrances, chocolates, flavored beverages, music) with similar sensory cues (e.g., smell, taste, color, sound), consumers prefer the first product in the sequence. However, when sampling a sequence of products with dissimilar sensory cues, consumers prefer the last product. These findings (1) contribute to a better understanding of the role of sequential sensory cues on consumer choice formation, (2) have implications for effects related to sensory habituation and sensory trace fading, and (3) help resolve apparent inconsistencies in prior research on order effects in the context of choices for sequentially sampled experiential products.",0
The Smell of Healthy Choices: Cross-Modal Sensory Compensation Effects of Ambient Scent on Food Purchases,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Managers are using ambient scent as an important strategic element in various service settings, with food-related scents being especially common. This research examines the effects of food-related ambient scents on children?s and adults? food purchases/choices. The results of a series of experiments, including field studies at a supermarket and at a middle school cafeteria, show that extended exposure (of more than two minutes) to an indulgent food?related ambient scent (e.g., cookie scent) leads to lower purchases of unhealthy foods compared with no ambient scent or a nonindulgent food?related ambient scent (e.g., strawberry scent). The effects seem to be driven by cross-modal sensory compensation, whereby prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods. Notably, the effects reverse with brief (<30 seconds) exposure to the scent. Whereas prior research has examined cross-modal effects, this research adopts the novel approach of examining cross-modal sensory compensation effects, whereby stimuli in one sensory modality (olfactory) can compensate/satisfy the desire related to another sensory modality (gustatory).",1
Shining Light on Atmospherics: How Ambient Light Influences Food Choices,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Retail atmospherics is emerging as a major competitive tool, and it is especially notable in the restaurant industry, where lighting is used to create the overall ambience and influence consumer experience. In addition to influencing overall experience, can ambient light luminance have unintended consequences in terms of influencing what diners order? The results of a field study at multiple locations of a major restaurant chain and a series of lab studies robustly show that consumers tend to choose less healthy food options when ambient lighting is dim (vs. bright). Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because ambient light luminance influences mental alertness, which in turn influences food choices. While restaurant and grocery store managers can use these insights and their ambient light switches to nudge consumers toward targeted food choices, such as healthy or high-margin signature items, health-conscious consumers can opt for dining environments with bright ambient lighting.",1
Stuck in the Past: Why Managers Persist with New Product Failures,Journal of Marketing,2006,"In this research, the authors examine the phenomenon of escalation bias in the context of managing new product introductions. In particular, they identify three general paths?Decision Involvement Inertia, Decision Involvement Distortion, and Belief Inertia Distortion?that can lead managers to escalate their commitments. The authors test the relative strength of these paths in driving observed escalation behavior. The results show that involvement with the initial decision, a key construct in numerous explanations for escalation behavior (e.g., agency theory, self-justification), is not a necessary condition to induce commitment to a losing course of action (i.e., escalation bias). Rather, the authors find that the driving force behind escalation behavior is improper use of initial positive beliefs in the face of negative new information. This insight has implications for the groundwork necessary for organizations to design systems, policies, and procedures to help them avoid the trap of escalation bias that is often associated with major strategic decisions.",0
The Sequence of Operational Modes Used by Finnish Investors in Germany,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"During the last two decades, foreign market entry has received extensive attention among international business scholars. Central among recent attempts to explain the sequence of operational modes used by foreign investors is the (Uppsala) internationalization model (Johanson and Vahlne 1977). The aim of the present study is to address the question of why some companies follow while others deviate from the ?traditional? establishment chain proposed in the Uppsala model. In an explanatory analysis on the sequence of operational modes used by a number of Finnish companies with sales or manufacturing subsidiaries in Germany, hypotheses based on the Uppsala internationalization model, industrial economics, and internalization theory received limited support. A separate analysis focusing on only manufacturing subsidiaries indicated that other factors, such as existing market network relationships, top management changes, and product characteristics, all have an important influence on the choice of local manufacturing as some firms? first operational mode abroad. Implications of these results for future theory building are discussed.",0
Extracting Summary Piles from Sorting Task Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"In a sorting task, consumers receive a set of representational items (e.g., products, brands) and sort them into piles such that the items in each pile ?go together.? The sorting task is flexible in accommodating different instructions and has been used for decades in exploratory marketing research in brand positioning and categorization. However, no general analytic procedures yet exist for analyzing sorting task data without performing arbitrary transformations to the data that influence the results and insights obtained. This manuscript introduces a flexible framework for analyzing sorting task data, as well as a new optimization approach to identify summary piles, which provide an easy way to explore associations consumers make among a set of items. Using two Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of single-serving snacks from a local retailer, the authors demonstrate that the resulting procedure is scalable, can provide additional insights beyond those offered by existing procedures, and requires mere minutes of computational time.",1
Locational Choices: Modeling Consumer Preferences for Proximity to Others in Reserved Seating Venues,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This article proposes a measurement approach to determine how consumers prefer to locate themselves in proximity to others during consumption experiences, such as when they purchase reserved seating tickets to a performance. Applied to data from locational choice experiments that simulate reserved seating assortments, administered to more than 2,000 participants, this approach reveals the importance of modeling proximity to others when studying locational choices. It also emphasizes the degree to which consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for proximity to both focal elements (e.g., stage, screen, aisles) and other consumers. Therefore, event operators should collect data beyond purchase ticket logs and also include consumers who did not purchase. Furthermore, this study illustrates how managers can use fitted, individual-level parameters and an optimization model to make more effective seat-level availability decisions. In addition to these recommendations for managers of reserved seating venues, this article offers novel contributions to research related to advance selling, spatial models, and personal space.",1
Specialist Competitor Referrals: How Salespeople can Use Competitor Referrals for Nonfocal Products to Increase Focal Product Sales,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Intuition suggests that a salesperson should not refer consumers to a competitor for products that they both sell. However, myriad examples reveal salespeople doing just that. The authors study specialist competitor referrals, a sales strategy by which one increases consumers? purchase likelihood of a focal product (e.g., a painting at an art gallery) by (1) referring consumers to a competitor (e.g., a frame warehouse store) that offers a nonfocal product (e.g., a frame) at a lower price, while (2) stating that the stores differ in their specializations (i.e., the stores concentrate their efforts on different goods). Using a study and survey with salespeople, experimental studies, an incentivized negotiation experiment, and a field study, the authors show that specialist competitor referrals can indeed benefit sellers. Specifically, they build on equity theory to show that specialist competitor referrals increase focal product sales by reducing consumers? perceived overpayment risk for the focal product via increasing perceived equity in the exchange. The authors also show that competitor referrals for nonfocal products that do not justify the price difference on the nonfocal product are ineffective.",0
Creating Effective Online Customer Experiences,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Creating effective online customer experiences through well-designed product web pages is critical to success in online retailing. How such web pages should look specifically, however, remains unclear. Previous work has only addressed a few online design elements in isolation, without accounting for the potential need to adjust experiences to reflect the characteristics of the products or brands being sold. Across 16 experiments, this research investigates how 13 unique design elements shape four dimensions of the online customer experience (informativeness, entertainment, social presence, and sensory appeal) and thus influence purchase. Product (search vs. experience) and brand (trustworthiness) characteristics exacerbate or mitigate the uncertainty inherent in online shopping, such that they moderate the influence of each experience dimension on purchases. A field experiment that manipulates real product pages on Amazon.com affirms these findings. The results thus provide managers with clear strategic guidance on how to build effective web pages.",0
Slotting Allowances and Fees: Schools of thought and the Views of Practicing Managers,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Slotting allowances and fees have attracted considerable attention and controversy since their introduction in the mid-1980s. Currently, two schools of thought dominate the debate on these fees. One considers them a tool for improving distribution efficiency, whereas the other proposes that the fees operate as a mechanism for enhancing market power and damaging competition. Managers and public policymakers are uncertain as to the effects of slotting fees and the appropriate strategy to adopt. The current study attempts to inform the debate surrounding slotting fees and provide guidance to managers and policymakers. The authors summarize the arguments of the two schools and investigate the views of managers toward them through a large-scale survey of manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer grocery institutions. Though exploratory, the findings suggest that slotting fees shift the risk of new product introductions and help apportion the demand and supply of new products. The authors find that slotting fees are also associated with the exercise of retailer market power, are applied in a discriminatory fashion, and lead to higher retail prices. The authors encourage further research that examines slotting fees and their effects and indicate prospective directions.",0
Reducing Assortment: An Attribute-Based Approach,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Most supermarket categories are cluttered with items, or stockkeeping units (SKUs), that differ very little at the attribute level. Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs. Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions?defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands)?affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand?size combination that was eliminated, nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are brand and flavor.",0
Inferring Latent Brand Dependencies,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In this article, the authors develop a class of models to reconstruct brand-transition probabilities when individual brand purchase sequence information is not available. The authors introduce two general model forms by assuming different underlying mechanisms for individual heterogeneity in brand switching. The first model form captures individual heterogeneity by a latent class structure. The second model form captures individual heterogeneity by postulating that the brand-choice probabilities follow a Dirichlet distribution, which yields the popular Dirichlet multinomial formulation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with a view toward assessing whether individual transition probabilities can be captured from knowledge of only aggregated brand choices. Results indicate that the proposed method can indeed capture individual brand-transition probabilities under several different conditions. An empirical application illustrates how these models can be used to provide important information on individual brand transitions and the role of marketing-related covariates.",1
A Direct Approach to Predicting Discretized Response in Target Marketing,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"A problem that occurs frequently in direct marketing is the prediction of the value of a discretizing function of a response variable. For example, to target consumers for a coupon mailing, a retail chain may want to predict whether a prospective customer's grocery expenditures exceed a predetermined threshold. The current approach to this prediction problem is to model the response variable and then apply the discretizing function to the predicted value of the response variable. In contrast with this ?indirect? approach, the authors propose a ?direct? approach in which they model discretized values of the response variable. They show theoretically that the direct approach achieves better predictive performance than the commonly used indirect approach when the response model is misspecified and the sample size is large. These two conditions are commonly met in direct marketing situations. This result is counterintuitive because the direct approach entails ?throwing away? information. However, although both the discretized response data and the continuous data provide biased predictions when a misspecified model is used, the lower information content of the discretized variable helps the bias be smaller. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation experiment, a retail targeting application, and a customer satisfaction application. The key managerial implication of the result is that the current practice of restricting attention to models based on the indirect approach may be suboptimal. Target marketers should expand the set of candidate models to include models based on the proposed direct approach.",1
Recommendation Systems with Purchase Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Many firms use decision tools called ?automatic recommendation systems? that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models. The author shows that the main model is better than benchmark models on key measures.",1
A Hybrid Choice Model that Uses Actual and Ordered Attribute Value Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In the usual multinomial choice model, consumers choose to use ?actual value? information; that is, utilities are continuous functions of product attributes (e.g., choices depend on actual magnitudes of price differences). The authors propose an alternative model in which consumers use only ?ordered value? information; that is, utilities are functions only of the relative orderings of the attributes' values across alternatives (e.g., choices depend only on the price ordering and not on actual prices). The ordered value model is attractive because it fits well with psychological evidence that consumers often favor decision mechanisms that are cognitively less demanding. Using a supermarket shopper panel data set, the authors evaluate four models in which (1) all consumers use actual values; (2) all consumers use ordered values; (3) some consumers use actual values all the time, and some consumers use ordered values all the time; and (4) all consumers use both actual values and ordered values but with different propensities. In the analysis, the ordered value model finds stronger support than the actual value model: Model 1 outperforms Model 2; in the two hybrid choice models (Models 3 and 4), ordered value processing is more prevalent than actual value processing. These results suggest that consumers in some product categories engage more heavily in ordered value processing than in actual value processing.",1
The Recoverability of Segmentation Structure from Store-Level Aggregate Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors focus on estimating a latent-class choice model with consumer response segments when only store-level aggregate data are available. Most of the proposed methodologies in the marketing literature require household panel data, which can be difficult to obtain. There is a growing stream of work in marketing and in empirical industrial organization that estimates segmentation structure with aggregate data. This article is a careful attempt to understand the extent to which disaggregate structure in the form of a latent-class model can be recovered from aggregate data. The authors show that under specific assumptions and when the household-level model is correctly specified, most of a latent-class segmentation structure is identifiable even if only store-level aggregate data are available. Therefore, the store data-based estimates for the latent-class model are consistent. In other words, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the estimates goes to zero with infinite sample size. To assess how well latent-class structure can be estimated from store data sets of sample sizes that are comparable to those in real life, the authors simulate more than 60,000 store data sets and compute the consequent model estimates and their estimation errors. The results show that the MAD of the latent-class estimates diminishes much more slowly with store data than with household data. Moreover, the rate is so slow that obtaining estimates with reasonably small MADs often requires unreasonably large sample sizes. The authors' simulations offer guidance on conditions that favor obtaining more accurate estimates from store-level data.",1
Learned Helplessness among Newly Hired Salespeople and the Influence of Leadership,Journal of Marketing,2014,"This article investigates the sales force socialization process, wherein newly hired salespeople often face failure-prone environments. Drawing from the learned helplessness paradigm, the authors hypothesize that cumulative periods of sales performance failure are associated with sales-oriented behavior intentions. In addition, the authors examine the influence of leadership, expecting core transformational leadership to have a diminishing effect as unmet sales goals accumulate. Study 1 finds support for these hypotheses using panel survey data from 221 new hires during six months of a furniture retailer's sales force socialization process. Then, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanism driving salesperson helplessness and a managerial approach that has a sustained impact, the authors conduct Study 2, a scenario-based experiment focused on the business-to-business insurance industry. The authors find that perceived task difficulty mediates the focal relationship and that error management enables core transformational leadership to have a lasting effect such that new hires have the lowest sales-oriented behavior intentions when transformational sales managers encourage them to make errors during their interactions with customers and to actively learn from their failures.",0
Managing Laggards: The Importance of a Deep Sales Bench,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Sales leaders often use threats of punishment to manage poor performers (i.e., laggards), but little research has examined the effect of these threats. The current research addresses this gap by investigating an intervention termed the ?bench program? with a field-based quasi experiment and a randomized lab experiment. In the field, the company under study told salespeople in treatment districts that a trainee would replace them at the end of the year if they failed to hit their quota and placed last in their district. Difference-in-differences analyses of matched treatment and control groups show that the bench program had an immediate and sustained impact on performance. Moreover, laggards improved their performance more than higher performers, and salespeople with larger advice networks improved their performance more than salespeople with smaller advice networks. A lab experiment compares the bench program with a program that had the same threat of firing but did not have replacements in sight. Performance in the bench program exceeded that in the firing condition, indicating that the vividness of a threat can increase its deterrent value.",1
Brain Responses to Movie Trailers Predict Individual Preferences for Movies and Their Population-Wide Commercial Success,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Although much progress has been made in relating brain activations to choice behavior, evidence that neural measures could actually be useful for predicting the success of marketing actions remains limited. To be of added value, neural measures should significantly increase predictive power, beyond conventional measures. In the present study, the authors obtain both stated preference measures and neural measures (electroencephalography; EEG) in response to advertisements for commercially released movies (i.e., movie trailers) to probe their potential to provide insight into participants? individual preferences as well as movie sales in the general population. The results show that EEG measures (beta and gamma oscillations), beyond stated preference measures, provide unique information regarding individual and population-wide preference and can thus, in principle, be used as a neural marker for commercial success. As such, these results provide the first evidence that EEG measures are related to real-world outcomes and that these neural measures can significantly add to models predicting choice behavior relative to models that include only stated preference measures.",1
Social Networks within Sales Organizations: Their Development and Importance for Salesperson Performance,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Although the study of salesperson performance traditionally has focused on salespeople's activities and relationships with customers, scholars recently have proposed that salespeople's intraorganizational relationships and activities also play a vital role in driving sales performance. Using data from 286 salespeople in a unique social network analysis, the authors explore the effects of salespeople's intraorganizational relationships on objective salesperson performance as well as the role of political skill in developing intraorganizational relationships. The results indicate that two types of social network characteristics (i.e., relational centrality and positional centrality) contribute substantially to salesperson performance. Moreover, salespeople's political skill is shown to be an antecedent to relational centrality but, surprisingly, not positional centrality. This finding demonstrates that researchers should not assume that all centralities represent similar underlying network characteristics. In light of these results, the authors discuss several implications for both managers and researchers as well as directions for further research.",0
EXPRESS: Educational Campaigns for Product Labels: Evidence from On-Shelf Nutritional Labeling,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Front-of-package and on-shelf nutrition labelling systems in supermarkets have been shown to lead to only modest increases in the purchase of more nutritious foods. Educational campaigns may increase the use of these types of product labels if 1) there is a lack of consumer awareness and/or understanding of the labels, and 2) the information provided lead consumers to prefer different products. We study a large-scale, national campaign for the Guiding Stars? nutrition labels conducted by a grocery retailer in Canada who implemented the labels. Using detailed household transaction data, we find only a small increase in the purchase of higher star-rated foods during the campaign, driven by produce purchases, and 60% of the effect disappears after the campaign?s conclusion. To explain the limited response, exit surveys were conducted outside of stores before and after the campaign. Awareness and understanding of the nutrition labelling system increased marginally after the campaign, but there was no increase in self-reported use.",1
Stickier Priors: The Effects of Nonanalytic versus Analytic Thinking in New Product Forecasting,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The author investigates scenario generation and analogical reasoning as potential sources of bias in new product forecasting. In a series of studies, scenarios and analogies are shown to have persistent effects on judgment, despite subsequent use of corrective analytic techniques (e.g., counterfactual reasoning, counterscenarios, counteranalogies, decomposition, accountability). These findings demonstrate the robustness of nonanalytic processes on judgment and the need to be aware of their seductive effects.",1
Using Loan plus Lender Literacy Information to Combat One-Sided Marketing of Debt Consolidation Loans,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The marketing of debt consolidation loans is intended to offer a financial remedy to consumers faced with mounting debt and credit problems and unable to meet their monthly payments. The authors argue that debt consolidation loan marketing overemphasizes the short-term benefits (e.g., lower monthly payments) and downplays the considerable downside of these loans (e.g., longer repayment and more total interest paid). Two experiments demonstrate that a financial literacy intervention combining information about loans and lenders can help consumers understand and respond to debt consolidation loan marketing (whereas a basic financial numeracy intervention does not). Implications for consumers, marketers, public policy makers, and researchers who work in the area of financial literacy are discussed.",1
How Do Price Fairness Perceptions Differ across Culture?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research investigates the effects of across-consumer price comparisons on perceived price fairness as a function of culture. Collectivist (Chinese) consumers are more sensitive to in-group versus out-group differences than individualist (U.S.) consumers. The collectivist perspective orients consumers toward the in-group and heightens concerns about ?face? (i.e., status earned in a social network) that arise from in-group comparisons. Process evidence for the causal role of cultural differences derives from manipulated self-construal and measurement of the emotional role of shame evoked by face concerns. Finally, in a robustness test, an alternative operationalization of the in-group/out-group distinction extends the findings to the context of firm relationships.",1
Sticky Priors: The Perseverance of Identity Effects on Judgment,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"This research examines the perseverance of identity-based judgments by exploring the effectiveness of various corrective procedures that are intended to neutralize identity effects on judgment. The authors explore these effects in a series of studies that involve different kinds of identities (e.g., parent, teenager, businessperson, environmentalist) linked to different objects and issues (e.g., Internet censorship, pollution credits, electronic books). Moreover, they test the effectiveness of various corrective procedures, including feature-based analysis, counterfactual reasoning, counteridentification, and social influence. The authors find that identity-driven thinking leads to judgment that resists change, that is, a procedural bias or ?sticky prior? in favor of an initial identity-based judgment. The findings attest to both the power of identity and the efficacy of analytic and nonanalytic corrective techniques.",1
Linking Marketing to Financial Performance and Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2004,"In January 2002, Donald R. Lehmann, Executive Director of the Marketing Science Institute, submitted a proposal for a JM Special Section, ?Linking Marketing to Financial Performance and Firm Value.? The proposal included activities to promote interactions among marketing academics and practitioners, designed to advance research on this topic. I was excited about the opportunity to stimulate and publish new research, and after extensive discussions, the American Marketing Association and the Marketing Science Institute formally agreed to cosponsor the Special Section. Authors submitted their manuscripts through a paper competition as well as directly through JM. Donald R. Lehmann, the Consulting Editor, and a panel of distinguished scholars reviewed every submission. The panel included Tim Ambler, Gregory S. Carpenter, Robert Jacobson, V. Kumar, Roland T. Rust, and Rajendra K. Srivastava. All submissions underwent JM's standard double-blind review process under my editorship, and members of JM's Editorial Review Board served as reviewers. I am pleased to have this opportunity to acknowledge the important contributions of these many individuals: both authors and reviewers. As the subsequent essay suggests, three years? hard work has produced a thought-provoking collection of articles. I hope they will generate further intellectual inquiry and debate about the link between marketing and financial performance in the business community.",0
Invited Commentaries on ?Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing?,Journal of Marketing,2004,"In the preceding article, Vargo and Lusch (V 2004) observe that an evolution is underway toward a new dominant logic for marketing. The new dominant logic has important implications for marketing theory, practice, and pedagogy, as well as for general management and public policy. Thus, their observations are likely to resonate with a broad cross-section of the business community. With the goal of stimulating discussion and debate, I invited some distinguished scholars to write brief commentaries on different aspects of V&L's article. I was delighted to receive a thoughtful and diverse set of comments. The ideas expressed in the article and the commentaries will undoubtedly provoke a variety of reactions from readers of Journal of Marketing. I hope you will enjoy reading, and thinking, about these scholars? views on the fundamental premises of marketing as much as I did.",0
To JM on Its 75th Anniversary,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This article discusses how Journal of Marketing (JM) has influenced marketing science and practice by publishing articles on substantive topics relevant to customers, managers, organizations, markets, and society. The journal's 75th anniversary coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Marketing Science Institute (MSI). Frequently, JM and MSI have collaborated to address important substantive marketing issues identified in MSI's Research Priorities. The author highlights seminal articles on brand equity; business-to-business marketing (including sales force management); connecting marketing information, metrics, and strategy; consumer behavior; innovation, new product development. and product management; marketing orientation and capabilities; and market research, methodology and services. She also draws attention to articles that have won the Sheth Foundation/JM Award and the H. Paul Root Award. The article describes how JM?s knowledge dissemination is amplified by powerful social network effects. Ideas in JM articles diffuse through the business community, influencing the mind-set of managers worldwide.",0
Expanding Business-to-Business Customer Relationships: Modeling the Customer's Upgrade Decision,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article develops a model of a business customer's decision to upgrade service contracts conditional on the decision to renew the contract. It proposes that the firm's upgrade decision is influenced by (1) decision-maker perceptions of the relationship with the supplier, (2) contract-level experiences, and (3) interactions between firm- and contract-level variables. The authors model the firm's decision as a binary logit model with random parameters for the contract-level variables and fixed parameters for the firm-level variables. They estimate the model with data describing more than 2000 service contracts and find that decision-maker satisfaction, service quality, and price have a significant effect on the decision to upgrade; price and satisfaction also moderate the effect of service quality on the decision. Simulations indicate that modest improvements in service quality for a focal contract can have a relatively large, positive effect on the likelihood that the firm will upgrade. The results suggest that suppliers need to manage their firm relationships at both the individual contract level and the overall firm level. In addition, the results suggest specific windows of opportunity for suppliers when firms may be more likely to upgrade to higher-level service contracts.",0
Price-Based Global Market Segmentation for Services,Journal of Marketing,2003,"In business-to-business marketing, managers are often tasked with developing effective global pricing strategies for customers characterized by different cultures and different utilities for product attributes. The challenges of formulating international pricing schedules are especially evident in global markets for service offerings, where intensive customer contact, extensive customization requirements, and reliance on extrinsic cues for service quality make pricing particularly problematic. The purpose of this article is to develop and test a model of the antecedents of business customers? price elasticities of demand for services in an international setting. The article begins with a synthesis of the services, pricing, and global marketing literature streams and then identifies factors that account for differences in business customers? price elasticities for service offerings across customers in Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. The findings indicate that price elasticities depend on service quality, service type, and level of service support and that horizontal segments do exist, which provides support for pricing strategies transcending national borders. The article concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of these results for effective segmentation of global markets for services.",0
The Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on the Sales Force,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This research draws from the psychodynamic perspective of social identity theory to examine the causal effect of mergers and acquisitions involving a mismatch of external images on the sales force. Study 1, a natural longitudinal experiment, shows that a merger with a poorer-image firm immediately dilutes salespeople's organizational identification (OI), which in turn impairs their performance. As sense makers, salespeople who are more tenured experience stronger OI dilution, whereas those who perceive a high level of social inclusion experience weaker OI dilution. As sense givers, managers who emphasize the firm's strategic intent in their communication buffer the OI-dilution effect, whereas those who emphasize the firm's organizational culture aggravate the effect. Study 2, a scenario-based experiment, further demonstrates that the OI-dilution effect is stronger than the OI-enhancement effect from merging with a better-image firm. Furthermore, both studies confirm that the adverse effect of mergers and acquisitions that involve a mismatch of external image stems from image uncertainty rather than job uncertainty.",1
Does a Customer on the Board of Directors Affect Business-to-Business Firm Performance?,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance.",0
"Self-Selected Sales Incentives: Evidence of their Effectiveness, Persistence, Durability, and Underlying Mechanisms",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Drawing on goal-setting theory, this study develops a new self-selected incentive scheme. Within this scheme, a sales employee chooses an individualized goal?reward level combination from a menu the firm proposes given the employee's past performance. To test the effects of the self-selected incentive scheme, the authors conducted two field experiments at two Fortune 500 companies. Results of both experiments show that, compared with two equivalent quota systems, sales employees? performance increased substantially under the self-selected incentive scheme. In addition, findings reveal that the performance increase induced by this scheme is substantially greater for sales employees with a high variation in past performance and for employees with a low past-performance level. Moreover, the authors find that the effects of the self-selected incentive scheme not only are durable when offered again but also persist after the scheme is discontinued. Through two additional online experiments, the authors extend the findings of the field studies, isolate the self-selected incentive scheme's three underlying mechanisms, and examine each mechanism's relative strength.",0
What Do We Know about Exporting by Small Italian Manufacturing Firms?,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This article is a survey of empirical research on the export activity of Italian SMFs. It presents selected findings from 26 empirical studies on success factors and export strategies, export entry channels, internal export organization, information acquisition and international market research, and obstacles to exporting. More than 10,000 exporting companies have been analyzed over a ten-year period. Although many findings are consistent with the export marketing literature, the survey also shows some important challenges to the established wisdom and suggests research directions.",0
Speaking for ?Free?: Word of Mouth in Free- and Paid-Product Settings,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This research examines drivers of consumer word of mouth (WOM) in free-product settings, revealing fundamental differences with traditional, paid-product settings. The authors build and investigate a theoretical model that highlights two unique characteristics of free products (reciprocity motivation and diminished adoption risk) and considers their implications for WOM sharing. Results of a retrospective survey, two controlled experiments, and an analysis of more than 5,000 mobile apps at Google Play and Apple?s App Store reveal that consumers are generally more likely to share their opinions of free products than paid products, because of feelings of reciprocity toward the producer. However, this difference is reduced when prior consumer WOM is low in volume and highly disperse, signaling greater adoption risk. These findings contribute to nascent understanding of free-product marketing while offering new insights for catalyzing consumer WOM.",1
?Mere Measurement Plus?: How Solicitation of Open-Ended Positive Feedback Influences Customer Purchase Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"In two studies (a longitudinal field experiment with an established business-to-consumer national chain, and a field experiment with a business-to-business software manufacturer), the authors demonstrate that starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation increases customer purchase behavior. Study 1, a longitudinal field experiment, shows that one year after the completion of a survey that began by asking customers what went well during their purchase experience, those customers spent 8.25% more than customers who had completed a survey that did not include the positive solicitation. Study 2 utlizes multiple treatment groups to assess the stepwise gains of solicitation, measurement, and solicitation frame. The results demonstrate (1) a mere solicitation effect, (2) a traditional mere measurement effect, and (3) an additional ?mere measurement plus? effect of an open-ended positive solicitation; all effects increased customer spending. Specifically, starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation resulted in a 32.88% increase in customer spending relative to a survey with no open-ended positive solicitation. The findings suggest that firms can proactively influence the feedback process. Soliciting open-ended positive feedback can create positively biased memories of an experience; the subsequent expression of those memories in an open-ended feedback format further reinforces them, making them more salient and accessible in guiding future purchase behavior.",1
Improvised Marketing Interventions in Social Media,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Online virality has attracted the attention of academics and marketers who want to identify the characteristics of online content that promote sharing. This article adds to this body of research by examining the phenomenon of improvised marketing interventions (IMIs)?social media actions that are composed and executed in real time proximal to an external event. Using the concept of quick wit, and theorizing that the effect of IMIs is furthered by humor and timeliness or unanticipation, the authors find evidence of these effects on both virality and firm value across five multimethod studies, including quasiexperiments, experiments, and archival data analysis. These findings point to the potential of IMIs in social media and to the features that firms should proactively focus on managing in order to reap the observed online sharing and firm value benefits.",0
Halo (Spillover) Effects in Social Media: Do Product Recalls of One Brand Hurt or Help Rival Brands?,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Online chatter is important because it is spontaneous, passionate, information rich, granular, and live. Thus, it can forewarn and be diagnostic about potential problems with automobile models, known as nameplates. The authors define ?perverse halo? (or negative spillover) as the phenomenon whereby negative chatter about one nameplate increases negative chatter for another nameplate. The authors test the existence of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance. Online chatter amplifies the negative effect of recalls on downstream sales by about 4.5 times.",1
Determining the Appropriate Depth and Breadth of a Firm's Product Portfolio,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Some firms have broad product lines; others have lean product lines. To determine the appropriate number of entries in a specific firm's product line, the author develops a model that balances the benefits of increased revenue from a broad product line against production and engineering costs. Two innovations were central in the development of the model: (1) redefining how products are scored on various product attributes so that attribute scores vary normally across the population of products and (2) redefining how the number of entries in a product portfolio is calculated in order to discount the significance of entries that are highly similar to existing products. The author also introduces the notion of a centroid time to more easily adjust sales and total development costs for product life cycle and investment life cycle effects. These redefinitions enable a firm's profit to be modeled as a simple function of its effective number of product entries, the effective number of competitors entries, the total sales in the segment, variable profits adjusted for capacity constraints, and product development costs. This leads to a simple expression for the profit-maximizing number of effective entries, both when competitor portfolios are fixed and when competitors dynamically adjust their portfolios. The author illustrates how to estimate and apply the model on a realistic example.",1
Scents and Sensibility: When Do (In)Congruent Ambient Scents Influence Product Evaluations?,Journal of Marketing,2006,"This research examines when and how ambient scents (i.e., scents that are present in the environment and do not emanate from a specific product) affect product evaluations. Consistent with theory in environmental psychology, the author predicts that such ambient scents can elicit emotional responses that can influence subsequent judgments, but only when specific conditions are met. Three factors are hypothesized to moderate the effects of pleasant ambient scents on evaluations: (1) the congruence of the scent with the product, (2) the salience of the scent, and (3) consumers? motivation to correct for extraneous influences. The findings of three experiments suggest that as long as ambient scents are congruent with the product, they continue to affect consumers? evaluations, even when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated to correct for extraneous influences. In addition, as long as the scent is not completely incongruent with the product, noncongruent scents are corrected for only when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently motivated. These findings indicate that the impact of pleasant ambient scents on product evaluations may be stronger than that of other affective environmental cues.",0
"Firm Innovativeness and Export Performance: Environmental, Networking, and Structural Contingencies",Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Much scholarly work has explored the benefits firms accrue from innovation activities. Although some research has shown that firm innovativeness is associated with enhanced export success, the conditions under which firm innovativeness activities are most and least beneficial are not well understood. The authors take a contingency perspective and use social capital theory to investigate how internal channel networking capability and structural factors as well as external environment factors affect the innovativeness?export performance relationship. Analysis of samples of exporting firms from Ghana and Bosnia and Herzegovina indicates that innovativeness is most beneficial for firms operating in competitive and dynamic export markets; those in less competitive and static markets do not benefit from their innovation activities to the same extent. Stronger networking capabilities and a more organic structure also enhance the innovativeness?export performance relationship. The findings imply that the management of firm innovativeness is not a straightforward task in which greater emphasis on innovation activities is always beneficial for firms; rather, exporting organizations must match firm innovativeness levels to external environmental conditions and internal capabilities and structures.",0
What's in a Message? The Longitudinal Influence of a Supportive versus Combative Orientation on the Performance of Nonprofits,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In this article, the authors propose that in the long run, a nonprofit organization with supportively oriented positioning (e.g., promoting a cause) is likely to survive longer and achieve more donations compared with a nonprofit with a combative orientation (e.g., fighting against something). To test this proposition, the authors adopt a three-pronged approach that (1) uses publicly available financial data from nonprofits? tax filings over a ten-year period, (2) measures annual donor pledges from a field study with a registered nonprofit organization, and (3) examines actual donation behavior of participants in a longitudinal lab study. Moreover, the authors test this proposition for donations of money as well as time. They consider various theoretical mechanisms that might cause the proposed effect, such as regulatory focus theory, inertia in giving, and the preponderance of supportive charities.",1
"Customer Inspiration: Conceptualization, Scale Development, and Validation",Journal of Marketing,2017,"Introducing customers to new ideas lies at the heart of marketing, yet surprisingly little is known about customers? state of inspiration within this domain. This article reviews prior conceptualizations of general inspiration in psychology and introduces the concept of customer inspiration as a customer's temporary motivational state that facilitates the transition from the reception of a marketing-induced idea to the intrinsic pursuit of a consumption-related goal. The authors develop and validate a two-state, ten-item customer inspiration scale that consists of inspired-by and inspired-to states. The scale development process begins with item generation, followed by five studies: (1) scale purification and initial validation, (2) exploration of the nomological network, (3) tests for the experimental and predictive validity, (4) replication within a field experiment, and (5) assessments of generalizability and boundary conditions. Empirical results reveal sound psychometric properties of the scale, demonstrate its unique position in relation to established marketing constructs, and support experimental and predictive validity. Applying the scale in marketing practice offers a new way for firms to increase demand, motivate customers? exploration behavior, and build customer loyalty.",0
Testing the Reliability of Weight Elicitation Methods: Direct Rating versus Point Allocation,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Two commonly used methods of assigning numerical judgments (i.e., importance weights) to attributes in order to signify their relative importance are point allocation (PA) and direct rating (DR). These methods may seem to be minor variants of each other, yet they produce very different profiles of attribute weights when rank ordered from most to least important. The weights elicited by DR were more reliable than those elicited by PA in a test?retest situation. An important practical implication of this is for multicriteria decision making. Using people's test?retest data as attribute weights on simulated alternative values revealed that the same alternative would be chosen on 88% of occasions with DR, but only 74% of occasions with PA. Moreover, subjects reacted more favorably to DR than to PA.",1
Do We Really Know how Consumers Evaluate Brand Extensions? Empirical Generalizations Based on Secondary Analysis of Eight Studies,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors investigate the empirical generalizability of Aaker and Keller's model of how consumers evaluate brand extensions. Various replications have reported different results. Using a comprehensive data set containing the data from the original study and seven replications conducted around the world, the authors undertake a secondary analysis to understand what generalizations emerge. The study has implications for the understanding of how brand extensions are evaluated and how empirical generalizations are made. For brand extensions, Aaker and Keller's model hypothesizes that evaluations of brand extensions are based on the quality of the original brand, the fit between the parent and extension categories, and the interaction of the two. The authors find support for this full model despite published results, including Aaker and Keller's own, that support only some of the hypotheses. The authors find evidence that the level of contribution of each of these components varies by brand and culture. With respect to empirical generalizations, the key implication is that it is premature to make firm conclusions about theory on the basis of only one study.",1
"A Customer Relationship Management Roadmap: What is Known, Potential Pitfalls, and Where to Go",Journal of Marketing,2005,"The goal of this preface is to describe how the special section on customer relationship management (CRM) was developed. In May 2003, Richard Staelin, Executive Director of the Teradata Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University, proposed that Journal of Marketing (JM) publish a special section. The proposal included activities that were designed to promote interactions among marketing academics and practitioners; the goal was to stimulate dialogue and new research on CRM. I found the proposal attractive because CRM is a broad-based topic that interests many marketers. After extensive discussion, the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Teradata Center formally agreed to cosponsor the special section. Subsequently, there was a conference on Relationship Marketing and Customer Relationship Management (cochaired by Michael Ehret, Wesley Johnston, Michael Kleinaltenkamp, and Lou Pelton) that took place at Freie Universitt Berlin in the summer of 2003;1 a conference on Customer Management (cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the Teradata Center) that was held at Duke University in March 2004; and two special sessions on CRM that were featured at the AMA Winter Educators' Conference held in San Antonio, Tex., in February 2005. The conferences provided many opportunities for dialogue, and the response from marketers who attended these events was enthusiastic. I also invited Richard Staelin and William Boulding (Executive Codirector of the Teradata Center) to work with me as consulting editors for the special section, and they agreed. A call for papers requested that authors submit their manuscripts to JM by May 2004. The consulting editors and I evaluated every submission with the assistance of an expert panel that included Leonard Berry, John Deighton, Michael Ehret, Christian Grnroos, Sunil Gupta, Wayne Hoyer, Wagner Kamakura, Wesley Johnston, Donald R. Lehmann, Charlotte Mason, Carl Mela, Scott Neslin, Roland Rust, Michel Wedel, and Valarie Zeithaml. All submissions underwent JM's standard double-blind review process, and members of JM's editorial review board served as reviewers. I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who participated in the development of the special section. The culmination of our work together is a set of nine articles and two essays that advance the science and practice of CRM. I hope that these articles stimulate new intellectual discoveries.?Ruth N.

Return Shipping Policies of Online Retailers: Normative Assumptions and the Long-Term Consequences of Fee and Free Returns,Journal of Marketing,2012,"To limit costs associated with product returns, some online retailers have instituted equity-based return shipping policies, requiring customers to pay to return products when retailers determine that customers are at fault. The authors compare the normative assumptions about customers that underlie equity-based return shipping policies with the more realistic, positivist expectations as predicted by attribution, equity, and regret theories. Two longitudinal field studies over four years using two surveys and actual customer spending data indicate that retailer confidence in those normative assumptions is unjustified. Contrary to retailer assumptions, neither the positive consequences of free returns nor the negative consequences of fee returns were reversed when customer perceptions of fairness were taken into account. Depending on the locus and extent of blame, customers who paid for their own return decreased their postreturn spending at that retailer 75%?100% by the end of two years. In contrast, returns that were free to the consumer resulted in postreturn customer spending that was 158%?457% of prereturn spending. The findings suggest that online retailers should either institute a policy of free product returns or, at a minimum, examine their customer data to determine their customers? responses to fee returns.",0
Executive Insights: Global Logistics,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"New developments in information technology and logistics practices are combining to offset traditional barriers to developing truly global business strategies. This article elaborates on these developments, provides a framework for understanding the scope and magnitude of global logistics, and presents a method for estimating heretofore unavailable global logistics expenditures.1",0
Determinants of Product-Use Compliance Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors examine factors that affect product-usage compliance, or the act of using a product as it is intended to be used. They develop a conceptual model of compliant behavior as a function of four main constructs: (1) salience/mindfulness, (2) the consumer's costs and benefits of compliant behavior, (3) advertising and distribution cues to action, and (4) the perceived threats associated with noncompliant behavior. They test the model using a regression mixture model of compliant behavior calibrated on unique panel data from four categories of pharmaceutical drugs that are used to treat chronic (i.e., lifelong) ailments. The findings include insights into the dynamics of product compliance: The data support the proposed four-stage evolution of compliant behavior between consecutive service provider (e.g., doctor) interventions. For marketers, the authors find substantial heterogeneity across consumers for the effects of cues from advertising and distribution. For example, in some segments, advertising has a positive impact on compliance (directly and/or by heightening responsiveness to product-efficacy evaluations), whereas in other segments, its effect is negative. Thus, the authors shed new light on the effects of advertising, which has both strong advocates and opponents in the pharmaceutical industry.",1
Managing Customer-Initiated Contacts with Manufacturers: The Impact on Share of Category Requirements and Word-of-Mouth Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors examine behavioral outcomes following a customer-initiated contact (CIC) with a manufacturer and develop a framework to explain the impact of vendor performance during a CIC on a customer's share of category requirements with a focal brand and word-of-mouth incidence following contact. The authors propose customer characteristics and context-specific factors that may relate to differences in the key characteristics of the underlying source model of share of category requirements and word of mouth. The authors then assess the overall importance of the explanatory variables in the source model and simultaneously test for systematic differences related to CIC-specific factors using survey data from more than 1700 CICs that involve more than 60 brands. A key assumption in much prior research that has examined customer?firm interactions is that CIC-specific factors, if they are included at all, create an automatic regularity that must be controlled for. The authors propose and find an additional effect. The responsiveness to factors under a firm's control varies across CICs, and therefore firms that adapt their processing have an advantage. Rather than provide a uniform response to all CICs, the authors' results offer managers several guidelines on how to customize their responses to the various CIC types and how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their firms' CIC management efforts.",1
Linking Customer Management Effort to Customer Profitability in Business Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Chain-link frameworks such as the service?profit chain (SPC) are much discussed as a means to link customer profits to operational resources under the influence of vendor managers, though empirical testing to date has been limited primarily to consumer services settings. In this article, the authors adapt the SPC framework to accommodate characteristics of business markets, specifically the complex decision-making unit, strategic supplier selection, and resource allocation at the individual customer level. They also extend the SPC framework to allow for a richer description of the complex linkages between vendor effort and account profitability, namely, nonlinear linkages and differential responsiveness occasioned by customer-specific factors such as competitive context. Controlling for such factors illuminates, to some degree, why similar levels of customer management effort and/or performance can yield quite different customer profitability outcomes. The authors present an application that demonstrates how adaptation and extension of the SPC to business markets can provide vendors with (1) insights into the process that culminates in individual customer profitability and (2) useful guidelines for adapting their customer management efforts at the individual account level with an aim to improve account profitability. The results show the importance of accounting for decreasing returns to customer management effort at a given account, and they reinforce the notion of customer delight.",1
When do Chief Marketing Officers Affect Firm Value? A Customer Power Explanation,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Recent discussions in academic literature and the business press often paint an unflattering picture of the contributions of chief marketing officers (CMOs) to the financial value of their firms. Some even suggest that CMOs, despite being the marketing leaders in firms, have little or no effect on firm performance. However, formal empirical research on the impact of CMOs on financial performance is scarce. This article presents conceptual arguments and empirical evidence about this controversial issue. The authors suggest that CMOs are far from irrelevant to the financial performance of firms. However, the impact of CMOs on financial performance is highly contingent on the managerial discretion available to them. Focusing on the role of customer power in limiting the managerial discretion available to CMOs, this study identifies individual and firm-specific conditions in which CMOs contribute more or less to firm value. Analyses of abnormal stock returns associated with the appointment of CMOs provide support for the hypothesized effects of customer power and managerial discretion.",1
(When) Does Third-Party Recognition for Design Excellence Affect Financial Performance in Business-to-Business Markets?,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Third-party recognition for design excellence is often viewed as an event triggering the success of a product with a good design. However, evidence from extant research raises doubt as to whether this form of recognition matters in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Using a demand shock conceptualization to capture the signaling role and demand uncertainty of such recognition, this research argues that third-party recognition for design excellence does create firm value in B2B markets. The effect varies, however, depending on certain types of chief executive officer functional experience (market and finance) and the criteria used by third parties in judging design superiority. Model-free evidence and matched-sample analysis provides empirical evidence in support of the demand shock perspective and the hypothesized effects. The research adds a new theoretical conceptualization describing the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence and unveils several new research areas. Managerially, the results identify several new facilitating conditions that enable B2B firms to create greater value from an innovation strategy based on superior design.",0
Branded Apps and Their Impact on Firm Value: A Design Perspective,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Although firms are increasingly launching branded mobile apps, an understanding of their influence on firm value remains elusive. Using stock market returns to assess firm value, the authors investigate the impact of branded mobile app announcements on such value. Moreover, recognizing that mobile apps generate various touchpoints in the customer journey, the authors also investigate how an app?s design shifts the effects of mobile apps on firm value. In particular, they investigate effects from whether an app emphasizes features related to peer-to-peer interactions about the brand, personal-oriented interactions between a customer and the brand, or the purchase phase itself. They find that the launch of a mobile app increases firm value and that the features emphasized in app design play an important role in such value creation. The study offers important implications regarding the accountability of branded mobile apps and provides direction for marketing theory and practice.",1
Beyond Fungible: Transforming Money into Moral and Social Resources,Journal of Marketing,2015,"An essential characteristic of marketing practice and theory is the promotion of exchanges, many of which are funded by money. Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding. The article closes with a discussion of implications for marketing managers and potential avenues for further research.",0
Help Me Help You! Employing the Marketing Mix to Alleviate Experiences of Donor Sacrifice,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Nonprofit organizations often rely on individuals to execute their mission of addressing unmet societal needs. Indeed, one of the most significant challenges facing such organizations is that of enlisting individuals to provide support through the volunteering of time or donation of money. To address this challenge, prior studies have examined how promotional messages can be leveraged to motivate individuals to support the missions of nonprofit organizations. Yet promotional messages are only one aspect of the marketing mix that may be employed. The present study examines how donor-based nonprofit organizations can employ the marketing mix?product, price, promotion, place, process, and people?to influence the experiences of sacrifice associated with donation. The authors do so through an ethnographic study of individuals participating in living organ donation. First, they identify the manifestation of sacrifice in donation. Next, they define three complementary and interactive types of sacrifice: psychic, pecuniary, and physical. Then, they articulate how the marketing mix can be employed to mitigate experiences of sacrifice that emerge through the donation process. The authors conclude by discussing implications for marketing practice and identifying additional research opportunities for sacrifice in the realm of donation.",0
Does the Firm's Technology and Marketing Profile Affect Foreign Market Entry?,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"The authors examine the influence of the firm's technology and marketing profile on foreign market entry mode by testing hypotheses based on data from 105 firms in four European countries. Four technology and marketing variables were the most important: (1) the firm's generic marketing strategy?market concentration versus diversification, (2) demand uncertainty?the position in the life cycle of the firm's principal product, (3) transaction costs?transaction uncertainty and research and development, and (4) value added?product patents. The authors suggest ways managers may be assisted in their foreign market entry decisions on the basis of their firms? technology and marketing profile.",0
Subscale Distance and Item Clustering Effects in Self-Administered Surveys: A New Metric,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors explore the effect of a form of question context on responses to a computer-mediated marketing research survey. As an increasing proportion of marketing research is conducted through computer interfaces, the pool of potential context effects is rapidly expanding. The authors conduct an experiment using a multi-item scale that consists of five dimensions and manipulate three such context effects: explicit item labeling, item presentation (alone/grouped), and subscale items presented contiguously or not. In a refined analysis of variance, the authors use a special one-dimensional case of the spatial and attribute-based distance metric proposed by Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (1999) to explain subscale variance, replacing the indicator variable for clustering used in a standard analysis of variance. This metric provides a scalar measure of how much variation exists in the order of presentation of items within a subscale (the subscale distance). This analysis indicates a significant decrease in subscale variance (increased reliability) with decreasing sub-scale distance but no-longer-significant effects due to labeling and grouping. The authors discuss implications of their findings for researchers conducting surveys in computer-mediated environments.",1
Modeling Behavioral Regularities of Consumer Learning in Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In this note, the authors propose several extensions of the model of consumer learning in conjoint analysis that Bradlow, Hu, and Ho (2004) develop. They present a clarification of the original model, propose an integration of several new imputation rules, add new measurement metrics for pattern matching, and draw a roadmap for further real-world tests. The authors also discuss general modeling challenges when researchers want to mathematically define and integrate behavioral regularities into traditional quantitative domains. They conclude by suggesting several critical success factors for modeling behavioral regularities in marketing.",1
A Learning-Based Model for Imputing Missing Levels in Partial Conjoint Profiles,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Respondents in a conjoint experiment sometimes are presented with successive partial product profiles. First, the authors model how respondents infer missing levels of product attributes in a partial conjoint profile by developing a learning-based imputation model that nests several extant models. The advantage of this approach over previous research is that it infers missing levels of an attribute not only from prior levels of the same attribute but also from prior levels of other attributes, especially ones that match the attribute levels of the current product profile. Second, the authors provide an empirical demonstration of their approach and test whether learning in conjoint studies occurs; to what extent; and in what manner it affects responses, partworths, and the relative importance of attributes. They show that the relative importance of attribute partworths can shift when subjects evaluate partial profiles, which suggests that consumers may construct rather than retrieve partworths and are sensitive to the order in which the profiles are presented. Finally, the results show that consumers' imputation processes can be influenced by manipulating their prior information about a product category. This research is of both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this research sheds light on how customers integrate different sources of information in evaluating products with incomplete attribute information; practically, it highlights the potential pitfalls of imputing missing attribute levels using simple rules and develops a better behavioral model for describing and predicting customers' ratings for partial conjoint profiles.",1
A Hierarchical Bayes Model for Assortment Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In this research, the authors merge an established methodology?hierarchical Bayesian modeling?and an existing utility model?Farquhar and Rao's (1976) balance model?to describe individual choices among assortments of multiattributed items. This approach facilitates addressing three managerial questions of direct importance: (1) Which assortment of a given size has the most customers for whom it is the preferred assortment (and what fraction of customers)? (2) Which products should be added to a given assortment to maximize the fraction of customers who can find their most preferred assortment? and (3) For a given assortment, what type of customer is likely to purchase it? The model is applied to assortment choices constructed from a set of eight popular magazines with five measured attributes: business, current events, human interest stories, sports, and technology. The analysis indicates that consumers are heterogeneous: Some customers are price sensitive and unresponsive to the magazine attributes, and others are sensitive to the magazine features but do not necessarily want more of them. In addition, the authors observe that many subjects do not prefer varied assortments; rather, consumers focus on purchasing magazines with high levels of the attribute they want.",1
Some New Thoughts on Conceptualizing Perceived Service Quality: A Hierarchical Approach,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Through qualitative and empirical research, the authors find that the service quality construct conforms to the structure of a third-order factor model that ties service quality perceptions to distinct and actionable dimensions: outcome, interaction, and environmental quality. In turn, each has three subdimensions that define the basis of service quality perceptions. The authors further suggest that for each of these subdimensions to contribute to improved service quality perceptions, the quality received by consumers must be perceived to be reliable, responsive, and empathetic. The authors test and support this conceptualization across four service industries. They consider the research and managerial implications of the study and its limitations.",0
Service Sweethearting: Its Antecedents and Customer Consequences,Journal of Marketing,2012,"This research is the first to examine service sweethearting, an illicit behavior that costs firms billions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Sweethearting occurs when frontline workers give unauthorized free or discounted goods and services to customer conspirators. The authors gather dyadic data from 171 service employees and 610 of their customers. The results from the employee data reveal that a variety of job, social, and remuneration factors motivate sweethearting behavior and several measurable employee traits suppress its frequency. The results from the customer data indicate that although sweethearting inflates a firm's satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word-of-mouth scores by as much as 9%, satisfaction with the confederate employee fully mediates these effects. Thus, any benefits for customer satisfaction or loyalty initiatives are tied to a frontline worker that the firm would rather not employ. Marketing managers can use this study to recognize job applicants or company settings that are particularly prone to sweethearting and as the basis for mitigating a positive bias in key customer metrics.",0
Brand Experience: What is It? How is it Measured? Does it Affect Loyalty?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Brand experience is conceptualized as sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand's design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments. The authors distinguish several experience dimensions and construct a brand experience scale that includes four dimensions: sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioral. In six studies, the authors show that the scale is reliable, valid, and distinct from other brand measures, including brand evaluations, brand involvement, brand attachment, customer delight, and brand personality. Moreover, brand experience affects consumer satisfaction and loyalty directly and indirectly through brand personality associations.",0
Competitive Vices,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In markets, firms must compete following a set of rules determined by laws, regulations, and social practices or pressures. This article investigates the effect of the degree of competition on the extent to which firms invest in behaving according to the rules of the marketplace. The authors model investments in following these rules as increasing the firm's marginal costs of production and decreasing its probability of being caught violating the market rules (and thus losing profits). They show that greater competition leads to smaller investments in following the market rules. This leads to (1) the existence of a social optimum degree of competition that is less than perfect competition and (2) more competition in general, thus prompting greater optimal monitoring efforts. Stricter market rules can lead to greater investments in satisfying the market rules and to lower production. The authors also present results on the likelihood of firms having broken the market rules depending on relative market shares, optimal monitoring, and the effect of dynamics on the incentives to satisfy the market rules.",1
Breaking through Fast-Forwarding: Brand Information and Visual Attention,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This research explores how fast-forwarding through commercials alters the visual attention of viewers and how marketers can tailor advertisements to retain effectiveness as digital video recorder usage rises. Building on prior work in visual marketing and perceptual psychology, the authors conduct two eye-tracker studies that show how fast-forwarding viewers pay more attention during commercials, but their attention is heavily limited to the center of the screen. Fast-forwarded advertisements containing brand information at screen center still create brand memory even with a 95% reduction in frames and complete loss of audio, whereas advertisements with brand information located elsewhere are of virtually no value. A third study shows that fast-forwarded commercials containing extensive central brand information can positively affect brand attitude, behavioral intent, and even actual choice behavior. These findings show that marketers can counteract the negative effects of digital video recorders by ensuring that their advertisements are heavily branded and that the branding is centrally located.",0
Transaction Attributes and Customer Valuation,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Dynamic customer targeting is a common task for marketers actively managing customer relationships. Such efforts can be guided by insight into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on customers? past purchase activity?namely, the recency and frequency of past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver a customer's requested level of service. They also show that the lost revenue is larger than the corresponding expected gain that would result from exceeding a customer's requested level of service. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for marketers in terms of managing customer relationships.",1
Using Childhood Memories to Gain Insight into Brand Meaning,Journal of Marketing,2007,"In this article, the authors introduce the concept that people's earliest and defining product memories can be used as a projective tool to help managers more fully understand consumers' relationships to their products. The authors use a study on three generations of automobile consumers to illustrate how these memories symbolize the consumer?brand relationship and how they can be used to gain insights into brand meaning. The findings indicate that people's earliest and defining experiences have an important influence on current and future preferences in predictable ways across the consumer life cycle. These memory experiences are symbolic to the consumer and represent a new lens for viewing brand meaning, which complements the toolbox of extant research methods. The authors provide details about this technique for managers who are searching for methods that recognize that consumers coproduce brand meanings.",0
Antecedents of Market Orientation: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors examine the effect of national culture on the relationship between market orientation and selected managerial antecedents. They develop and test a theoretical framework with samples from Germany, Thailand, and Indonesia. The findings suggest that national culture has an impact on the effects of antecedents in some cases, whereas in other situations, culture-independent relationships emerge.",0
Operationalizing Psychic Distance: A Revised Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Psychic distance, as described in the Uppsala internationalization model, is based on the impediments to information flows between a country market and a firm. The greater the impediments, the longer is the distance. The operationalization of psychic distance in empirical investigations is most commonly accomplished through the estimation of perceived ?differences? between countries because it is argued that differences account for impediments to knowledge flows. However, this process is highly flawed. This article responds to the many calls for an improvement in the understanding and operationalization of psychic distance. It does so not only by holding to the original definition but also by accounting for wider measures than the differences between the firm's home country and the target country. The author identifies 15 variables from the literature and discusses the relationship between the variables and psychic distance. Using these variables, he constructs an index that measures psychic distance and then applies it to measure distances between 25 country combinations. Finally, he compares the results with actual exporter behavior. A close, negative correlation exists between the psychic distance index and firms? actual selection of export markets.",0
A Wallet Full of Calories: The Effect of Financial Dissatisfaction on the Desire for Food Energy,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"This study shows that people experiencing financial dissatisfaction may choose and consume food for its energy value. Because money and food are closely related, exchangeable resources, financially dissatisfied people may be motivated to replenish their need for financial resources by consuming caloric resources or food energy. Five experiments provide support for this hypothesis across various measures of caloric desire and actual eating behavior. The findings have notable implications for marketing and public policy. Whereas marketing researchers have increasingly investigated the interplay of taste and health considerations in food consumption, this research demonstrates the importance of investigating food energy considerations.",1
How Does Assortment Affect Grocery Store Choice?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors investigate the impact of product assortments, along with convenience, prices, and feature advertising, on consumers? grocery store choice decisions. Extending recent research on store choice, they add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore, optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices, the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa.",1
Treating Zero Brand Sales Observations in Choice Model Estimation: Consequences and Potential Remedies,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"This research focuses on the consequences of and potential remedies for incorporating zero brand sales observations when calibrating choice models on the basis of household panel data. As the authors show both analytically and empirically, including or excluding zero brand sales observations can bias price elasticities, even in cases in which the data are generated by a multinomial logit model. The authors show that an appropriate choice of a model form (i.e., specification) is influenced by the incidence of ?missingness? and the mechanism presumed to be causing a brand to have no purchases in a given store/week. The authors propose two model forms that may perform well in the presence of zero brand sales observations and investigate their relative performance on the basis of simulated data and two household panel data sets.",1
Inaction Traps in Consumer Response to Product Malfunctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors develop and test a theory of consumer inaction traps in the domain of decisions to either address or endure product malfunctions. According to this theory, the magnitude of product malfunctions can have a paradoxical effect on consumption experience. In particular, the less severe a product malfunction is, the more inclined consumers are to defer the initial decision about whether to take corrective action. Subsequent opportunities for corrective action are devalued relative to previously forgone ones. This dynamic tends to trap consumers in a state of inaction, resulting in their enduring smaller malfunctions longer than larger ones. A consequence of these inaction traps is that minor product malfunctions may result in less enjoyable overall consumption experiences than more severe defects. Evidence from eight experiments and a survey provides support for this theorizing by demonstrating the inaction-trap phenomenon, examining its downstream consequences, shedding light on the psychological dynamics of inaction, and identifying boundary conditions that suggest interventions for counteracting consumers? vulnerability to suffering disproportionately from relatively minor product malfunctions.",1
When Does Culture Matter? Effects of Personal Knowledge on the Correction of Culture-Based Judgments,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Four experiments demonstrate that culture-based differences in persuasion arise when a person processes information in a cursory, spontaneous manner, but these differences dissipate when a person's intuitions are supplemented by more deliberative processing. North Americans are persuaded more by promotion-focused information, and Chinese people are persuaded more by prevention-focused information, but only when initial, automatic reactions to messages are given. Corrections to these default judgments occur when processing is thoughtful. These results underscore the idea that culture does not exert a constant, unwavering effect on consumer judgments. A key factor in determining whether culture-based effects loom large or fade is the extent to which a person draws on cultural versus more personal knowledge when he or she is forming judgments.",1
The Reciprocal Effects of Brand Equity and Trivial Attributes,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Brands increasingly introduce products with attributes that fail to provide consumers with meaningful benefits (i.e., trivial attributes). The authors present two experiments that examine the effect of brand equity on consumer valuation of such trivial attributes and the reciprocal effect that such a strategy may have on brand equity. The results show that both high and low equity brands benefit from offering an attractive trivial attribute in the absence of a disclosure of its true value. However, prechoice disclosure of an attribute's triviality heightens the role of the brand and context cues. Competing low equity brands benefit by sharing the trivial attribute with a higher equity brand, whereas competing high equity brands benefit from uniquely offering a trivial attribute. Postchoice revelation that an attribute is trivial hurts the subsequent ability of a low but not a high equity brand to differentiate in a new product category, particularly among subjects who had previously chosen the target brand. For insights on brand dilution, the authors also examine consumer attributions regarding marketer intent for offering a trivial attribute.",1
"Consumer Packaged Goods in the United States: National Brands, Local Branding",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors document several striking general geographic patterns in the performance of national brands using a large longitudinal scanner database that spans many consumer packaged goods categories and U.S. regional markets. Across markets, they observe that for a typical national brand, the geographic variation in market shares, perceived quality levels, and local dominance is so large that it questions the concept and relevance of a ?national brand.? Across time, the authors find that the geographic differences in market shares for national brands are persistent and thus are attributed to ?long-term? outcomes. The objective of this article is to open a discussion on these surprising stylized findings related to geography in the food and beverage industries. The authors argue that geographically indexed consumer packaged goods data contain rich information about long-term marketing outcomes that offer several new directions for further research.",1
Do Digital Video Recorders Influence Sales?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors analyze a multimillion dollar, three-year field study sponsored by five firms to assess whether enabling skipping of advertisements using digital video recorders (DVRs) affects consumers? shopping behavior for advertised and private label goods. A large sample of households received an offer for a free DVR and service, and close to 20% accepted. Each household's shopping history is observed for 48 consumer packaged goods categories during the 13 months before and the 26 months after the DVR offer. The authors fail to reject the null hypothesis of no DVR treatment effect on household spending on advertised branded or private label goods, either one or two years after the DVRs are shipped. The predicted DVR effect is tightly centered around 0, suggesting that the data have sufficient power to identify a true null effect. Using advertising exposure information for seven of the brands in the study, the authors offer suggestive evidence that ad skipping occurs for a relatively small fraction of the total television content viewed. The authors also discuss other potential explanations for the lack of a DVR effect.",1
The Emergence of Market Structure in New Repeat-Purchase Categories: The Interplay of Market Share and Retailer Distribution,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors study brand-share dynamics among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent. In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.",1
The Periodicity of Pricing,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Retail pricing data combine multiple decisions (e.g., regular pricing and discounting) that are possibly made by multiple decision makers (e.g., retailers and manufacturers). For example, temporary price reductions (high-frequency price changes) can be used to price discriminate in the short run, whereas regular price adjustments (low-frequency price changes) might reflect changes in long-term costs or demand. Time disaggregation cannot disentangle these factors, because frequency aggregation exists even when data are analyzed at the lowest possible level of temporal aggregation. Because little is known about the nature of pricing interactions across various planning cycles, this article develops several empirical generalizations about the role of periodicity in pricing. Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the planning horizon of the predominant interaction does not typically coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5) periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within a category. The authors conclude by discussing several practical marketing applications for which marketing decisions across frequencies have relevance.",1
Using Multimarket Data to Predict Brand Performance in Markets for Which No or Poor Data Exist,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The authors show how multimarket data can be used to make predictions about brand performance in markets for which no or poor data exist. To obtain these predictions, the authors propose a model for market similarity that incorporates the structure of the U.S. retailing industry and the geographic location of markets. The model makes use of the idea that if two markets have the same retailers or are located close to each other, then branded goods in these markets should have similar sales performance (other factors being held constant). In holdout samples, the proposed spatial prediction method improves greatly on naive predictors such as global-market averages, nearest neighbor predictors, or local averages. In addition, the authors show that the spatial model gives more plausible estimates of price elasticities. It does so for two reasons. First, the spatial model helps solve an omitted variables problem by allowing for unobserved factors with a cross-market structure. An example of such unobserved factors is the shelf-space allocations made at the retail-chain level. Second, the model deals with uninformative estimates of price elasticities by drawing them toward their local averages. The authors discuss other substantive issues as well as future research.",1
Finding a Home for Products We Love: How Buyer Usage Intent Affects the Pricing of Used Goods,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Consumers often dispose of used products by selling them in a secondary market (e.g., classified advertisements, Craigslist, eBay). When consumers must dispose of products to which they feel emotionally attached, they often expect to sell the product at a price in excess of its market value. However, the authors identify a condition in which product attachment can decrease rather than increase the minimum price sellers are willing to accept. Specifically, they propose that due to concern for how products are used following a transaction, strongly attached sellers may be more willing than weakly attached sellers to provide discounts to potential buyers whose usage intentions are deemed appropriate. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on one particular consequence of attachment, namely, the intensified reluctance of consumers to part with their possessions, this research identifies a novel consequence of attachment: a heightened sensitivity to the manner in which the product will be used following a transaction. Four empirical studies provide converging evidence that sellers? product attachment determines the extent to which their minimum acceptable sales price is influenced by buyer usage intent.",0
Key Factors for Successful Export Performance for Small Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"What key factors result in superior export performance for small firms from small countries? Drawing on the internationalization process model and organizational learning theory, the authors hypothesize and find that (1) emphasizing international sales while (2) restricting exports to a few foreign markets results in superior perceived export performance for the sample of small firms from Greece and several Caribbean countries. Emphasizing international sales while focusing on a few markets enables small firms to develop expertise in those markets, build strong distribution networks, and manage export activities effectively.",0
Small Victories: Creating Intrinsic Motivation in Task Completion and Debt Repayment,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Tasks such as the elimination of all debts when faced with the immediate option to spend can be unpleasant but not conceptually difficult. Dividing these tasks into smaller parts and completing the parts from smallest size to largest size can help people realize quick motivational gains that increase their likelihood of completing the task. The authors more broadly define this idea as ?small victories? and discuss, model, and empirically examine two related behavioral theories that might explain it. A laboratory experiment tests this prediction and provides data for model calibration. Consistent with the idea of small victories, when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest). The calibrated model is consistent with the directional predictions of each theory. However, when participants are given choice over orderings, they choose the ascending ordering least often. The authors conclude with a discussion of the efficacy of this method in stylized debt-repayment scenarios.",1
Managing Marketing Channel Opportunism: The Efficacy of Alternative Governance Mechanisms,Journal of Marketing,2000,"The authors examine three governance mechanisms according to how well they mitigate opportunism in marketing channels. Using the U.S. hotel industry as the research context, the authors investigate how opportunism is limited by (1) ownership, (2) investment in transaction-specific assets, and (3) norms of relational exchange. They also investigate how various combinations of these governance mechanisms affect opportunistic behavior in hotel channels. Overall, the results generally support emphasizing relational norms in managing opportunism in marketing channels. The results also indicate that opportunism can be exacerbated when ownership or investments in transaction-specific assets are accentuated as governance mechanisms.",0
Teaching Old Brands New Tricks: Retro Branding and the Revival of Brand Meaning,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Retro brands are relaunched historical brands with updated features. The authors conduct a ?netnographic? analysis of two prominent retro brands, the Volkswagen New Beetle and Star Wars: Episode I?The Phantom Menace, that reveals the importance of Allegory (brand story), Aura (brand essence), Arcadia (idealized community), and Antinomy (brand paradox). Retro brand meanings are predicated on a utopian communal element and an enlivening paradoxical essence. Retro brand management involves an uneasy, cocreative, and occasionally clamorous alliance between producers and consumers.",0
The Customer Orientation of Service Workers: Personality Trait Effects on Self-and Supervisor Performance Ratings,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Prior research indicates that market orientation is associated with positive outcomes for firms. For service organizations, a market orientation is implemented largely through individual service workers. The authors investigate the mediational role of customer orientation in a hierarchical model of the influence of personality traits on self-rated and supervisor-rated performance. The results support a partially mediated hierarchical model. Three basic personality traits (emotional stability, agreeability, and the need for activity) account for 39% of the variance in the customer orientation of employees. In turn, the customer orientation measure and conscientiousness account for 26% of the variance in self-rated performance. The customer orientation measure, along with the direct effects of conscientiousness and agreeability, account for 12% of the variance in manager ratings. The authors discuss the results and their implications for marketing researchers and managers.",1
"The Better They are, the more They Give: Trade Promotions of Consumer Durables",Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors study trade promotions for durable goods, such as automobiles, for which manufacturers provide special incentives to dealers for exceeding specific sales targets. They develop a theoretical model of consumer, retailer, and manufacturer behavior based on observations about key aspects of the automobile market. The analysis provides important insights about the intertemporal effects of trade promotions and the effect of product durability on the promotion strategies of manufacturers. For example, manufacturers of more durable products benefit more from running trade promotions and give deeper discounts. The authors find empirical support when they test the theoretical results.",1
Bayesian Nonparametric Dynamic Methods: Applications to Linear and Nonlinear Advertising Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Bayesian methods for dynamic models in marketing have so far been parametric. For instance, it is invariably assumed that model errors emerge from normal distributions. Yet using arbitrary distributional assumptions can result in false inference, which in turn misleads managers. The author therefore presents a set of flexible Bayesian nonparametric (NP) dynamic models that treat error densities as unknown but assume that they emerge from Dirichlet process mixtures. Although the methods address misspecification in dynamic linear models, the main innovation is a particle filter algorithm for nonlinear state-space models. The author used two advertising studies to confirm the benefits of the methods when strict error assumptions are untenable. In both studies, NP models markedly outperformed benchmarks in terms of fit and forecast results. In the first study, the benchmarks understated the effects of competitive advertising on own brand awareness. In the second study, the benchmark inflated ad quality, and consequently, the effects of past advertising appeared 36% higher than that predicted by the NP model. In general, these methods should be valuable wherever state-space models appear (e.g., brand and advertising dynamics, diffusion of innovation, dynamic discrete choice).",1
Communicating Brands in Television Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Many studies have quantified the effects of TV ad spending or gross rating points on brand sales. Yet this effect is likely moderated by the different types of brand-related messages or cues (e.g., logo, brand attributes) embedded in the ads and by the ways (e.g., explicitly or implicitly) these cues are conveyed to TV audiences. The authors thus measure 17 cues often used within ads to build brand awareness (or salience) and brand image and investigate their influence on ad effectiveness. Technically, the study builds a dynamic model to quantify the effects of advertising on sales; builds a robust and interpretable (i.e., nonparametric and sparse) factor model that integrates correlated, left-censored branding cues; and then models the effects of advertising as a function of the factors identified by these cues. An analysis of 177 campaigns aired by 62 brands finds that salience cues (e.g., logo) and benefit and attribute messages moderate ad effectiveness. It also finds that explicit cues are more effective than implicit ones; nonetheless, the primary drivers of ad effectiveness are visual salience cues: the duration and frequency with which the logo and the duration with which the product are displayed. The study can thus suggest ways brand and ad agency managers can improve the effects of creative ad content on sales.",1
Dynamic Effectiveness of Advertising and Word of Mouth in Sequential Distribution of New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Firms in many industries release new products in sequential stages. They also launch separate advertising campaigns at each distribution stage. Thus, communication mix elements?advertising and word of mouth (WOM)?can play important, distinct, and yet interdependent roles in stimulating new product demand. Their effectiveness may fluctuate within and across stages and spill over from earlier to later stages. Thus, the authors construct a dynamic linear model to study the dynamic effects of advertising and WOM on demand for heterogeneous products across stages. They further apply the model to examine a canonical example, the theater-then-video sequential distribution of motion pictures, and estimate the parameters using Kalman filtering/smoothing and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The results show that advertising and WOM exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving demand. Subsequent optimization exercises suggest that films of varied characteristics can potentially re-allocate their advertising budgets and reap additional revenues.",1
"A Dynamic Model for Digital Advertising: The Effects of Creative Format, Message Content, and Targeting on Engagement",Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"The authors study the joint effects of creative format, message content, and targeting on the performance of digital ads over time. Specifically, they present a dynamic model to measure the effects of various sizes of static (GIF) and animated (Flash) display ad formats and consider whether different ad contents, related to the brand or a price offer, are more or less effective for different ad formats and targeted or retargeted customer segments. To this end, the authors obtain six months of data on daily impressions, clicks, targeting, and ad creative content from a major U.S. retailer, and they develop a dynamic zero-inflated count model. Given the sparse, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian nature of the data, the study designs a particle filter/Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for estimation. Results show that carry-over rates for dynamic formats are greater than those for static formats; however, static formats can still be effective for price ads and retargeting. Most notably, results also show that retargeted ads are effective only if they offer price incentives. The study then considers the import of these results for the retailer's media schedules.",1
Discovering how Advertising Grows Sales and Builds Brands,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Advertising nudges consumers along the think?feel?do hierarchy of intermediate effects of advertising to induce sales. Because intermediate effects?cognition, affect, and experience?are unobservable constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models explain how advertising grows sales but ignore the role of intermediate effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments the dynamic advertising?sales response model by integrating the hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic advertising?sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating hierarchy (advertising ? experience ? cognition ? affect ? sales). The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales growth and brand building. Thus, both researchers and managers should consider using the proposed framework to capture advertising's dual contributions of building brands and growing sales.",1
Extreme Makeover: Short- and Long-Term Effects of a Remodeled Servicescape,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Using survey and transaction data from a natural experiment in a fast-food chain, the authors investigate the effects of store remodeling. They test (1) short- and long-term effects on customers? cognitions, affect, and behavioral intentions; (2) the moderating impact of spontaneous versus planned and group versus single-customer store visits; and (3) the differential effects on two store performance measures: average customer spending and store traffic. The results show that, in line with adaptation-level theory, short-term remodeling effects lose strength in the long run (i.e., after six months). Furthermore, customers on a spontaneous trip or in a group tend to be more responsive to store remodeling than customers on a planned trip or alone. Finally, whereas average spending increases in the short run and then returns to the baseline, store traffic initially remains unaffected and even shows a dip in the long run. These findings imply that ignoring the time-variant character of remodeling effects, the nature of customers? store visits, or the impact on store traffic may lead to inappropriate allocation of marketing resources.",0
Role of Reference Price on Price and Quantity: Insights from Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors study the role of reference price in a setting in which both the price and the quantity are set through personal interaction during the transaction process, such as in business-to-business markets. Most studies on reference price in the marketing research literature focus on consumer packaged goods, for which prices are typically fixed during the shopping trip and the transaction does not involve personal interaction with a salesperson. In this study, the authors study the effect of reference price on the quantity purchased and also on the pricing outcome of the transaction. They estimate a simultaneous equation system of both pricing and quantity purchased. The findings are as follows: (1) Reference price effects exist on quantity purchased and on the transaction pricing outcome in business-to-business market transactions, (2) business customers react asymmetrically to price increases and price decreases, and (3) salespeople have their own reference prices that affect the transaction price. The authors also find that customer experience with the salesperson might exacerbate the loss aversion effect. They conclude by discussing the underlying reasons behind these findings and their managerial implications.",1
A Simulated Annealing Heuristic for a Bicriterion Partitioning Problem in Market Segmentation,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"K-means clustering procedures are frequently used to identify homogeneous market segments on the basis of a set of descriptor variables. In practice, however, market research analysts often desire both homogeneous market segments and good explanation of an exogenous response variable. Unfortunately, the relationship between these two objective criteria can be antagonistic, and it is often difficult to find clustering solutions that yield adequate levels for both criteria. The authors present a simulated annealing heuristic for solving bicriterion partitioning problems related to these objectives. A large computational study and an empirical demonstration reveal the effectiveness of the methodology. The authors also discuss limitations and extensions of the method.",1
Multicriterion Clusterwise Regression for Joint Segmentation Settings: An Application to Customer Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The authors present a multicriterion clusterwise linear regression model that can be applied to a joint segmentation setting. The model enables the consideration of segment homogeneity, as well as multiple dependent variables (segmentation bases), in a weighted objective function. The authors propose a heuristic solution strategy based on simulated annealing and examine trade-offs in the recovery of multiple true cluster structures for several synthetic data sets. They also propose an application of the model to a joint segmentation problem in the telecommunications industry, which addresses important issues pertaining to the selection of the objective function weights and the number of clusters.",1
Factors Influencing Supplier Share Allocations in an Overseas Chinese Context,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Recent international attention has been drawn to marketing opportunities in Asia and the important role of customer relationships in supplier performance. However, empirical research on industrial buying behavior in Asia is sparse, and the extant literature indicates that buyer behavior may differ in non-Western industrial marketing relationships. Drawing on transaction cost economics and relational exchange theory, the authors develop a model that provides new insights into how international supplier behaviors affect manufacturer trust?performance perceptions and their business share allocation in a Chinese-dominated business environment. The results from 340 industrial relationships indicate the significant role of communications and adaptations in relationship development. Moreover, trust in suppliers and their performance are equally important factors in a manufacturer's business share allocation. The study contributes to the generalizability of relationship marketing theory and practice through empirical evidence on the transferability of Western business concepts.",0
Distribution Intensity and New Car Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors develop a new method to assess how changes in the intensity of mature distribution networks?specifically, those in the U.S. automotive industry?might affect consumer choice. They capture distribution intensity by car make (e.g., Honda, Toyota) at the disaggregate level using the exact geographic locations of individual buyers and new car dealers. They develop three buyer-centric measures for the intensity level of each competing make from this information: (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to the buyer's location). The authors propose a logit choice model, estimated with Bayesian methods, to study the association of these measures with new car choices. They apply the model to buyer records in the midsize premium sedan category, drawn from an anonymous sample provided by the Power Information Network. All three buyer-centric measures of intensity were significantly related to new car choice. Buyers were more likely to select cars whose dealer networks had shorter distances to the closest outlet (accessibility), more dealers within a given radius from the buyer (concentration), and locations that skewed toward the buyer (spread). Based on the modeling results, the market share elasticity of distribution intensity averages approximately .6 across the new car models included in the study. The approach should help firms evaluate the potential effects of expanding or contracting distribution networks for mature products.",1
A Model of Web Site Browsing Behavior Estimated on Clickstream Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Using the clickstream data recorded in Web server log files, the authors develop and estimate a model of the browsing behavior of visitors to a Web site. Two basic aspects of browsing behavior are examined: (1) the visitor's decisions to continue browsing (by submitting an additional page request) or to exit the site and (2) the length of time spent viewing each page. The authors propose a type II tobit model that captures both aspects of browsing behavior and handles the limitations of server log-file data. The authors fit the model to the individual-level browsing decisions of a random sample of 5000 visitors to the Web site of an Internet automotive company. Empirical results show that visitors' propensity to continue browsing changes dynamically as a function of the depth of a given site visit and the number of repeat visits to the site. The dynamics are consistent both with ?within-site lock-in? or site ?stickiness? and with learning that carries over repeat visits. In particular, repeat visits lead to reduced page-view propensities but not to reduced page-view durations. The results also reveal browsing patterns that may reflect visitors' time-saving strategies. Finally, the authors report that simple site metrics computed at the aggregate level diverge substantially from individual-level modeling results, which indicates the need for Web site analyses to control for cross-sectional heterogeneity.",1
Scalable Target Marketing: Distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Hierarchical Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Many problems in marketing and economics require firms to make targeted consumer-specific decisions, but current estimation methods are not designed to scale to the size of modern data sets. In this article, the authors propose a new algorithm to close that gap. They develop a distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating Bayesian hierarchical models when the number of consumers is very large and the objects of interest are the consumer-level parameters. The two-stage and embarrassingly parallel algorithm is asymptotically unbiased in the number of consumers, retains the flexibility of a standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The authors show that the distributed MCMC algorithm is faster and more efficient than a single-machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. They illustrate the approach with simulations with up to 100 million consumers, and with data on 1,088,310 donors to a charitable organization. The algorithm enables an increase of between $1.6 million and $4.6 million in additional donations when applied to a large modern-size data set compared with a typical-size data set.",1
The International Market Entry Choices of Start-Up Companies in High-Technology Industries,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"For a young, resource-constrained, technology-based start-up embarking on international sales, the choice of entry mode is a strategic decision of major importance. Yet within the emerging research stream of international entrepreneurship, curiously little attention has been devoted to the empirical analysis of foreign market entry forms. The authors address this important issue by analyzing the determinants of 398 export decisions taken from a U.K. survey of 246 technology-based start-ups with international activities. The findings show that the entry mode decision is necessarily a trade-off between the resources available and the support requirements of the customer. Issues of the innovativeness of the technology and the historic channel experience of the firm in its domestic market are particularly strong determinants of mode choice. The authors suggest that an organizational capability perspective on these firms? behavior offers a better explanation of their entry decisions than either transaction cost or stage theory.",0
A Multiattribute Benefits-Based Choice Model with Multiple Mediators: New Insights for Positioning,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Previous research has demonstrated that consumers evaluate products according to their perceived benefits when making a choice. This article extends prior work by proposing a method that evaluates the degree to which multiple a priori defined benefits mediate product choices. The model is the first to consider process heterogeneity?that is, heterogeneity in how consumers perceive multiple attributes to positively or negatively affect multiple benefits simultaneously and the contribution of each benefit to product utility. The authors propose discrete choice experiments to holistically measure the link between attributes and benefits, as well as between attributes and choice, resulting in data that can be analyzed with a generalized probit model. The approach contributes to mediation research by offering an alternative method of handling multiple multinomial mediators and dichotomous outcome variables. An empirical illustration of bread choices shows how consumer judgments about health and value perceptions of products mediate purchase decisions. The authors demonstrate how the method can help managers (1) confirm and test existing knowledge about latent benefits, including whether they explain all the variation in choice, and (2) consider process heterogeneity to inform market segmentation strategies.",1
Facilitating and Rewarding Creativity during New Product Development,Journal of Marketing,2011,"In an effort to improve creativity in the new product development process, many firms offer incentive programs, creativity training programs, or both. However, creativity continues to be a construct that is not well understood in marketing, and little research has examined the joint influence of such initiatives on creative outcomes. As a result, there is considerable variance in the way firms approach these issues. A qualitative study of 20 firms indicates that 15 offered some type of incentive program, whereas only 7 engaged in creativity training (a subset of the firms used both). Given that previous research has consistently found that extrinsic rewards offered in isolation actually undermine the creative process (by reducing intrinsic motivation), it seems that many firms may be unwittingly hampering their own creative efforts. However, two experiments demonstrate that the effect of rewards can be made positive if offered in conjunction with appropriate training. Specifically, product creativity was highest when the monetary reward was paired with a dedicated creative training technique. The training alters the influence of the reward such that it reinforces, rather than undermines, intrinsic motivation. Managers can improve the effectiveness of their creative efforts by leveraging the use of incentives and training in combination.",0
Repairing the Damage: The Effect of Price Knowledge and Gender on Auto Repair Price Quotes,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"The authors investigate whether sellers treat consumers differently on the basis of how well informed consumers appear to be. They implement a large-scale field experiment in which callers request price quotes from automotive repair shops. The authors show that sellers alter their initial price quotes depending on whether consumers appear to be correctly informed, uninformed, or misinformed about market prices. The authors find that repair shops quote higher prices to callers who cite a higher benchmark price and that women are quoted higher prices than men when callers signal that they are uninformed about market prices. However, gender differences disappear when callers mention a benchmark price for the repair. Finally, the authors find that repair shops are more likely to offer a price concession if asked to do so by a woman than if asked by a man.",1
"Clustering, Knowledge Sharing, and Intrabrand Competition: A Multiyear Analysis of an Evolving Franchise System",Journal of Marketing,2018,"As franchise systems expand, the clustering and resulting proximity of same-brand outlets often become contentious issues. The increased interactions among outlets may facilitate knowledge sharing, even while inducing intrabrand competition. Prior research has considered each possibility?knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition?in isolation, resulting in conflicting recommendations to the central question of whether multiple same-brand outlets should be close to or distant from one another. In this study, the authors take the perspective of the focal outlet and show that the opportunity to share knowledge afforded by clustering-based proximity may or may not be realized, depending on the motivation and ability of the proximal outlets to share knowledge, the focal outlet's ability to absorb knowledge, and the governance context. An analysis of more than 8,000 observations on the 988 outlets of a U.S.-based automotive service franchise system from 1977 to 2012, and corresponding outlet-level sales information from 2004 to 2012, provides support for the authors? hypotheses.",0
The Impact of Vertical Coordination on Ex Post Transaction Costs in Domestic and International Buyer?Seller Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Even though the transaction costs framework has evolved considerably in the past decade, there is still only modest empirical knowledge about the governance performance implications of the theory. This article focuses on the governance performance of vertical coordination in relationships between manufacturing firms. On the basis of transaction cost analysis and related works in international marketing, the authors examine the impact of asset specificity and vertical coordination on ex post transaction costs in domestic and international buyer?seller relationships. In accordance with current literature in international marketing, performance measurement problems are expected to be more evident in international business trade than in domestic business-to-business relationships. The empirical findings show that under conditions with substantial asset specificity, vertical coordination reduces ex post transaction significantly more in international buyer?seller relationships than in domestic channel dyads.",0
When Does Vertical Coordination Improve Industrial Purchasing Relationships?,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Vertically coordinated ties are purportedly effective responses to the uncertainties of fast-changing purchasing environments. Building on transaction costs arguments and related work in marketing, the authors analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty and show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. The authors use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test the hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high environmental uncertainty. Conversely, vertical coordination increases transaction difficulties when firms adapt to high environmental uncertainty and specific investments are substantial. The authors discuss the importance of these results for transaction cost theory and develop the results into a managerial decision framework for designing purchasing ties that balances safeguarding and adaptation.",0
Export Market-Oriented Behavior and Export Performance: Quadratic and Moderating Effects under Differing Degrees of Market Dynamism and Internationalization,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"In general, findings in the market orientation research stream indicate that market orientation has a positive linear relationship with business success, and managers have been urged to be more market oriented, regardless of the firm's current market orientation level. The authors develop a theory that predicts that the relationship between market orientation and business performance is an inverted U shape, such that high levels of market orientation may reduce performance. The authors? empirical study of firms? export market-oriented (EMO) activities in their export operations finds support for the hypothesized inverted U-shaped relationship between EMO behavior and export sales performance. They show that the inverted U-shaped relationship becomes greater in magnitude (more pronounced) as market dynamism increases and that the optimal value of EMO behavior (i.e., the value that generates the highest performance return) decreases as market dynamism increases and increases as exporting firms? internationalization increases. Therefore, they conclude that management's task is not to aim for ever-increasing levels of market orientation but to manage market orientation so that its level is optimal given the firm's environment and the international diversification strategy being pursued.",0
The Effect of Location on Price Estimation: Understanding Number?Location and Number?Order Associations,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The location in which a product is presented can influence consumers' numerical estimates of product attributes (e.g., price). This effect can be driven by two alternative processes. First, people may have acquired a learned association between numerical magnitude and location as a consequence of frequently viewing larger numbers to the right of smaller ones. In addition, they may have learned a procedure of reading or writing numbers from left to right in increasing order of magnitude. The authors present six experiments that demonstrate the effect of location on numerical estimates and provide evidence that both number?location associations and number?order associations could drive this effect.",1
An Empirical Examination of a Technology Adoption Model for the Context of China,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"As multinational corporations engage in technology adoption internationally, it is becoming increasingly important for managers to pursue a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption and effective use of new technology in divergent markets. In this study, the authors explore a technology adoption model (TAM) that is appropriate for the context of China. Employing a sample of 506 Chinese business professionals, they develop and test a modified TAM within the Chinese business culture. The results indicate that the modified TAM works well. The authors discuss implications for international marketing academics and practitioners.",0
Strategic Foretelling: Communication-Based Antecedents of a Firm's Propensity to Preannounce,Journal of Marketing,2000,"The authors examine preannouncements as strategic marketing communications aimed at influencing the perceptions and attitudes of industry stakeholders. The growth of the Internet points to the expanded importance of preannouncements. With an investigation of 265 chief executive officers (CEOs) and presidents from manufacturers of new products, the authors examine the effects of three firm-specific factors (first-mover predisposition, firm information interactivity, and competitive equity building) and one environmental construct (industry dynamism) on a firm's propensity to preannounce its future intended actions. The results indicate that competitive equity building, defined as a firm's tendency to pursue a high-profile leadership position within its industry, is the main driver of a firm's propensity to preannounce. Future directions for research include the development of a normative preannouncement framework and investigation of the role of preannouncements within the context of CEO marketing activities.",0
"Joint Ventures in China: A Comparative Study of Japanese, Korean, and U.S. Partners",Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The authors develop a model to examine systematically the relationship among motivation, control, and performance of joint ventures in China. Motivations are categorized into three dimensions: efficiency, competition, and learning. Motivations determine the level of control in joint ventures, and that level affects the joint venture's performance. The authors collected data from Japanese, Korean, and U.S. partners of joint ventures in China. They use structural equation modeling to test the model and examine cross-national differences using a multigroup comparison method. The results suggest a complex relationship among motivation, control, and performance. More control over joint ventures in China is beneficial to foreign partners, but the ability to exert control is influenced by firms? strategic intentions and familiarity with the local culture and market. Foreign partners that have such familiarity can exert considerable control over joint ventures and still obtain local knowledge. Foreign partners that want to enhance competitiveness can apply their advanced skills and technology in research and development, production, and management to exert more control over these functional areas.",0
Harmful Upward Line Extensions: Can the Launch of Premium Products Result in Competitive Disadvantages?,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Companies often extend product lines with the goal of increasing demand for their products and responding to competitive threats. Although line extensions may lead to cannibalization and reduction of overall profit, the bulk of theoretical and empirical research has suggested that product line extensions result in a net gain of overall demand and market share. To mitigate cannibalization, the extant literature prescribes the addition of premium versions of products, or ?upward line extensions,? with the intention of achieving gains not only in demand and market share but also in overall profit. In this research, the authors employ analytical and empirical methods to make the case that upward line extensions aimed at matching a competing product's attribute may lead consumers to reassess their perceptions about the brand and the attributes of products in the market in a way that erodes the advantages of the extending firm. Ultimately, this can result in a loss of demand, market share, and profit for the extending firm.",0
Strategic Information Transmission in Peer-to-Peer Lending Markets,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, such as Uber, Airbnb, and Lending Club, have experienced massive growth in recent years. They now constitute a significant portion of the world's economy and provide opportunities for people to transact directly with one another. However, such growth also challenges participants to cope with information asymmetry about the quality of the offerings in the marketplace. By conducting an analysis of a P2P lending market, the authors propose and test a theory in which countersignaling provides a mechanism to attenuate information asymmetry about financial products (loans) offered on the platform. Data from a P2P lending website reveal significant, nonmonotonic relationships among the transmission of nonverifiable information, loan funding, and ex post loan quality, consistent with the proposed theory. The results provide insights for platform owners who seek to manage the level of information asymmetry in their P2P environments to create more balanced marketplaces, as well as for P2P participants interested in improving their ability to process information about the goods and services they seek to transact online.",0
Tournaments to Crowdsource Innovation: The Role of Moderator Feedback and Participation Intensity,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Firms increasingly use innovation tournaments to crowdsource innovation ideas from customers. This article uncovers antecedents and consequences of customers? participation intensity over the course of a tournament. More specifically, the authors theorize on the effects that the type and timing of moderating feedback have on tournament participants? participation intensity, as well as the effect of the latter on idea quality. Through two longitudinal experiments using a commercial innovation tournament platform, the authors show that moderating feedback stimulates ideators? participation intensity. They find that negative feedback increases participation intensity, as compared to no feedback and positive feedback. Moreover, negative feedback, either provided in isolation or together with positive feedback, is more effective during the early stages than in the later stages of a tournament. Using a large-scale managerial survey, the authors show that higher participation intensity leads to higher idea quality and better business performance. The effect of participation intensity on idea quality is stronger than the effect of number of ideas and as strong as the effect of number of participants on idea quality.",0
"Three Cheers?Psychological, Theoretical, Empirical?for Loss Aversion",Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"This note emphasizes the special role of prospect theory in drawing psychophysical considerations into theories of decision making with respect to risk. An example of such a consideration is the dependence of outcome value on a reference point and the increased sensitivity of loss relative to gain (i.e., loss aversion). Loss aversion can explain the St. Petersburg paradox without requiring concave utility, it has the correct psychological foundation, it is theoretically useful, and it is a parsimonious principle that can explain many puzzles. A few open questions are whether loss aversion is a stable feature of preference, whether it is an expression of fear, and what are its properties.",1
Let?s Make a ?Deal?: How Deal Collectives Coproduce Unintended Value from Sales Promotions,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Users of deal collectives coproduce ?deals? that yield value beyond what a marketer intends when offering promotions. The authors develop an understanding of how this unintended value is coproduced through the combined actions of users in deal collectives. Users are drawn to deal collectives by a web of motivations that include subversive shopper feelings, which reflect a desire to outsmart firms and temporarily upend the market power structure. Uncovered transvaluation processes show that deal forums?due to their collective knowledge, creativity, and trust?are more effective than individual consumers at identifying, developing, and vetting opportunities to capture unintended value. The authors further reveal that unintended value can stem from untargeted promotions, pricing and promotion errors, and combinations or stacking of promotions. Strategies for monitoring deal collectives and either discouraging or supporting their activities are offered.",0
?Says Who?!? how the Source of Price Information and Affect Influence Perceived Price (Un)fairness,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,Three experiments show that the source of price change information?whether human or nonhuman?moderates the effect of price change on perceptions of price fairness. Both inferences of the marketer's motive and stimulus-induced affect mediate the effects of the source and price change. Opportunity and motivation to process also affect the relative influence of inferred motive and affect. This research demonstrates antecedent roles of both price source and affect.,1
Will the Real-World Citizen Please Stand Up! The Many Faces of Cosmopolitan Consumer Behavior,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The continuing globalization of marketing activities has given considerable impetus to the study of cosmopolitanism as a consumer construct. Most recent research has focused on the normative activities of cosmopolites, as consumers who seek to broaden their cultural horizons by immersing themselves in a breadth of local cultural experiences. Although this is true of some cosmopolites in some circumstances, it is not a general characteristic. The authors return to the original meaning of cosmopolitanism as presented (independently) by Merton and Gouldner in the late 1950s, examining the concept in light of subsequent research and the social forces that have tended to promote an increasingly cosmopolitan perspective. They then propose several patterns of cosmopolitan behavior, only one of which is a normative search for culturally broadening experiences. Finally, they suggest some managerial implications for marketing practitioners.",0
Buyer?Supplier Relationships and Customer Firm Costs,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Academic literature and business practice are directing increased attention to the importance of creating value in buyer?supplier relationships. One method for creating value is to reduce costs in commercial exchange. The authors develop a model that explains how supplier behaviors and the management of suppliers affect a customer firm's direct product, acquisition, and operations costs. The model proposes that these costs mediate the relationship between buyer?supplier relationship behaviors and the customer firm's intentions to expand future purchases from the supplier. The model is tested on data collected from almost 500 buying organizations in the United States and Germany. The results indicate that increased communication frequency, different forms of supplier accommodation, product quality, and the geographic closeness of the supplier's facilities to the customer's buying location lower customer firm costs. In addition, customer firms intend to increase purchases from suppliers that provide value by lowering each of these costs.",0
Reducing Adverse Selection through Customer Relationship Management,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Adverse selection is an important problem for marketers. To reduce the chances of acquiring an unprofitable customer, companies may screen prospects who respond to a marketing offer. Prospects who respond are often not approved. At the same time, prospects who are likely to be approved are unlikely to respond to a given marketing offer. Using data from a firm's customer relationship management system, the authors show how to target prospects who are likely to respond and be approved. This approach increases the number of customers who are approved and reduces the number of applicants who may defect after being turned down. This method can be extended to new customer acquisition and more effective targeting of costly promotions to migrate customers to higher levels of lifetime value.",0
Benefits Leader Reversion: How a Once-Preferred Product Recaptures its Standing,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"In general, consumers establish a preference for one product early in a decision process. When this preference does not include consideration of product prices, the currently preferred product is called the ?benefits leader.? This article proposes that consumers who switch to a cheaper product after learning prices retain a trace of preference for the benefits leader. Retention of the benefits leader is evidenced by the distortion of new information to favor the benefits leader and by greater-than-normative reversion to it. The authors also find that reversion does not occur when the initially leading product (that consumers switch from) is based on a cost savings. This suggests that though consumers retain cognitive elements associated with benefits leaders, they do not retain similar elements associated with leaders based on cost savings.",1
The Budget Contraction Effect: How Contracting Budgets Lead to Less Varied Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"How do consumers adjust their spending when their budget changes? A common view is that the allocation of one's current budget should not depend on previous budget allocations. Contrary to this, the authors find that when the budget contracts to a particular level, consumers select less variety (as measured by the number of different items with some of the budget allocated to them) than when their budget expands to that same level. This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion under the expanding budget. Evidence from five experiments indicates that the effect is driven by a desire to avoid feelings of loss associated with spreading allocation cuts (relative to reference quantities from previous allocations) across many items.",1
Performance Implications of International Product Strategies and the Integration of Marketing Activities,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This study investigated the relationships among firm performance, international markets, international product strategy, and the international integration of marketing activities. Performance was operationalized using sales growth and return on investment. Hypotheses were tested on the relationship between a firm's performance and (1) the match between its international product strategy and the international market served, and (2) the match between its international product strategy and the international integration of its marketing activities. These hypotheses were supported when sales growth was used as a dependent variable. No statistically significant relationship was found between either match and return on investment.",0
When to Give up Control of Outsourced New Product Development,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The author investigates the impact of client control on supplier task performance in the burgeoning area of outsourced new product development. In relationships in which the outsourced task requires a high degree of creativity on the part of the supplier, ex ante contractual control is shown to increase supplier performance. In contrast, ex post client control is shown to reduce supplier performance, though certain highly skilled clients can overcome this effect. Behaviorally, clients exercise less control both ex ante and ex post in relationships in which the outsourced task requires a high degree of creativity on the part of the supplier. Managerially, the results suggest that clients should use more ex ante control to govern highly creative tasks. In general, clients should use less ex post control over such tasks, though highly skilled clients can actually benefit from using greater control.",0
An Integrated Power and Efficiency Model of Contractual Channel Governance: Theory and Empirical Evidence,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Power theories (e.g., social exchange theory, resource dependence theory) and efficiency theories (e.g., transaction cost analysis) offer very different perspectives on the design of contractual governance in marketing channels. Whereas power theory suggests that governance will reflect the preferences of powerful firms, efficiency theories argue that governance will maximize joint value. In this research, the authors provide an integrative framework that reconciles power and efficiency perspectives in the context of contractual marketing channel relationships. This framework discriminates between two methods of exercising power: ex ante (through a tightly specified, efficient contract that rewards the powerful firm through the price mechanism while providing strong safeguards for the weak firm) or ex post (through a loosely specified, inefficient contract that allows the powerful firm to exploit its power during renegotiations). The authors argue that power will cause channel governance to deviate from the efficient choice, but only to the extent that the powerful firm cannot price out (i.e., extract) the value it offers to the weaker firm ex ante. As exchange conditions become more uncertain, power will demonstrate stronger effects on governance. This theory is supported with data from studies on contractual research-and-development relationships and procurement contracts for customized industrial products.",0
Neural Correlates of Susceptibility to Group Opinions in Online Word-of-Mouth Recommendations,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The present study examines the relationship between social influence and recommendation decisions among adolescents in the new media environment. Participants completed the App Recommendation Task?a task that captures neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is significantly correlated with participants changing their recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects. Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the concept of being a ?successful idea salesperson,? respectively. Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference shifts and consideration of the mental states of others in recommendation environments that include peer opinions.",1
Managing Consumer Uncertainty in the Adoption of New Products: Temporal Distance and Mental Simulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Drawing on theories of new product adoption and intertemporal choice, the authors show in cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations (Study 1) that when adoption is in the distant future, people are more concerned about performance- and symbolic-benefit uncertainties. In contrast, in the near future, the concerns are more about switching- and affective-cost uncertainties. In Studies 2 and 2a, using theories of mental simulation, the authors show that in the distant-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote outcome simulations are more effective in reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in the near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote process simulations are better at reducing switching cost and affective uncertainties, assuaging anxiety, and increasing behavioral intentions. The authors also find positive effects of these communication strategies on actual adoption rates and postconsumption satisfaction (Study 2) and on delayed behavioral intentions (Study 2a). In addition, these communication strategies are more efficacious in increasing behavioral intentions when uncertainty levels are higher (Study 3). The key managerial implications are that communication strategies for new products need to reduce uncertainties about costs and benefits and account for temporal distance to adoption.",1
Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task?s perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms? perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.",1
The Influence of Disorganized Shelf Displays and Limited Product Quantity on Consumer Purchase,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The current research explores how shelf display organization and limited product quantity together influence consumer purchase. The authors find that, in certain cases, shelves that are disorganized and not fully stocked tend to reduce sales, but in other cases, disorganized shelves that are not fully stocked tend to increase sales. In particular, for products that are ingested (e.g., juice), purchase likelihood is reduced when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. However, for products that are not ingested (e.g., fabric softener), purchase likelihood increases when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. Importantly, the authors also show that brand familiarity moderates these effects.",0
Because I (Don't) Deserve It: How Relationship Reminders and Deservingness Influence Consumer Indulgence,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Marketers regularly remind consumers of valued social relationships (e.g., close friends, family, romantic couples) to influence choice and consumption. However, the author's research reveals that such relationship reminders can backfire when consumers lack or no longer have these highlighted relationships. The author shows that reminding consumers of relationships they lack reduces their perceptions of deservingness and causes them to restrict indulgent consumption. Five studies establish the effect of relationship reminders on indulgence and provide support for the underlying process by both measuring and manipulating perceptions of deservingness.",1
Feeling Love and Doing More for Distant Others: Specific Positive Emotions Differentially Affect Prosocial Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love?as a trait and a momentary emotion?is unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.",1
Executive Insights: International Partnering?A Systematic Framework for Collaborating with Foreign Business Partners,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"One consequence of market globalization has been the growing incidence of collaborative ventures among companies from different countries. Small and large, experienced and novice, companies increasingly are choosing partnerships as a way to compete in the global marketplace. Motives for international collaborative ventures are varied and complex, including a desire to leverage resources and assets, retain flexibility, reduce risks, gain speed, and capitalize on each partner's strengths. The systematic framework presented here can be used by managers as a practical, ten-step approach to establishing successful collaborative ventures. The article also discusses four major types of international business partnership?distributor agreements, licensing, franchising, and joint ventures, and highlights key success factors for each.A major player in express package delivery, United Parcel Service (UPS) has been actively globalizing its operations for more than 20 years. The company first entered Canada and Germany and then other markets without a strategic plan or much commitment. The approach was simply enter markets one by one, set up operations, and wait for the market to develop. When available, UPS acquired an existing delivery company in order to get established more quickly.In exploring entry into Japan, UPS encountered a significant challenge. While UPS is competent in distribution and logistic networking, it knew little about the Japanese market and quickly realized that it needed a partner with customs clearance expertise. In a market well known for nontariff trade barriers, UPS also required assistance in deciphering the complex legal, structural, and political environment. A local partner would provide specific market expertise and help UPS overcome entry barriers. Furthermore, with a legacy of losing money in overseas operations, UPS did not wish to risk much capital in Japan.For these reasons, partnering with a qualified Japanese company made most sense. Yamato of Japan emerged as a prospective partner. It was experienced, had access to distribution channels, and was well capitalized. Interestingly, when UPS began negotiations, it inquired whether Yamato would be interested in a purchase. Yamato management asked the selling price of UPS?not exactly what UPS had in mind! As it turned out, there was a good fit and sufficient rationale for the two companies to establish a strategic alliance. UPS realized that a partnership with Yamato could not be a one-way street and arranged to bring packages back to the United States for delivery from Yamato. This opened up the market in both directions for each company. Teams of employees were exchanged to learn about organization and business processes, which provided valuable experience in making each company a truly global player.",0
Strategic Orientations in Export Pricing: A Clustering Approach to Create Firm Taxonomies,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Changes in the global economy have made pricing strategy increasingly important for exporting manufacturers. However, relatively little empirical work exists on export pricing strategies to guide marketing managers. The authors use a firm's strategic orientations in export pricing to create firm typologies. They find that four clusters of firms differ across organizational, venture-related, export market, and performance variables. The findings suggest that managerial orientations in export pricing can be successfully used to group firms in how they approach pricing decisions.",0
"Middle-Class Consumers in Emerging Markets: Conceptualization, Propositions, and Implications for International Marketers",Journal of International Marketing,2018,"As emerging markets gain significance in the global economy, understanding the middle-class customers within these dynamic economies becomes even more critical for international marketers. This article contributes to the limited but growing literature on this topic. International marketing scholars and practitioners should be better informed about this megatrend. What does the ?middle class? really mean? What are the theoretical underpinnings for the middle-class phenomenon? What are the implications for international marketing? To address these pressing questions, the authors explore the middle-class phenomenon in emerging markets. Through an examination of conceptual underpinnings and empirical observations, they present a conceptualization and several theoretical propositions. Finally, they provide managerial and scholarly implications of the middle-class phenomenon and offer suggestions for further research.",0
International Marketing as a Field of Study: A Critical Assessment of Earlier Development and a Look Forward,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Fundamental changes taking place in the global business environment and in the business enterprise itself compel international marketing scholars to reexamine the progress being made by the field's scholars in developing knowledge. In this article, the authors critically evaluate progress in international marketing as a field of study through ontological, thematic, and methodological lenses. They also offer a portfolio of research topics that they believe are worthy of scholarly attention.",0
"Curbing Foreign Distributor Opportunism: An Examination of Trust, Contracts, and the Legal Environment in International Channel Relationships",Journal of International Marketing,2004,"Many tenets of cross-border governance arrangements are broad-brush projections of domestic findings. To explore such generalizations, this study uses data from a large set of U.S.-based manufacturers to formulate and test propositions about limiting the potential opportunistic behavior of foreign distributors. The findings challenge two generalizations about governance arrangements in the cross-border context. The first is that a manufacturer is often handicapped disproportionately by its level of brand and scale prominence. Formal contracts as prescribed by transaction cost analysis, though negatively related to opportunism, do not have a significant effect on the alleviation of foreign distributor opportunism. The second generalization is that the joint use of trust and formal contracts is not significantly associated with opportunism. Trust and formal contracts serve different purposes. Trust makes the relationship function, and contracts institute and legitimize it. Furthermore, previous studies investigate opportunism in isolation, whereas this study points to the influence of legal hostility on the management of opportunism in the export market.",0
Ethnographic Stories for Market Learning,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Although ethnography has become a popular research approach in many organizations, major gaps exist in the field's understanding of the way it operates in the corporate world, particularly in how ethnography facilitates market learning. Drawing from extensive fieldwork in the world of commercial ethnography, the authors describe how ethnographic stories give executives a unique means of understanding market realities. By working through the rich details of ethnographic stories infused with the tensions, contradictions, and emotions of people's everyday lives, executives are better able to grasp the complexity of consumer cultures. Overall, this research should help managers leverage the catalytic effects of ethnographic storytelling in their efforts to learn about and understand market contexts.",0
A Cultural Approach to Branding in the Global Marketplace,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"International marketing's commitment to a technical and universalizing approach to solving managerial problems has meant that researchers have adopted an ethnocentric approach to branding. This is becoming problematic as the global marketplace develops. The authors argue that to meet the theoretical and methodological challenges of global branding, international marketing scholars will need to revise some key premises and foundations. Branding research in the future will need to be contextually and historically grounded, polycentric in orientation, and acutely attuned to the symbolic significance of brands of all types. The authors offer some conceptual foundations for a culturally relative, contextually sensitive approach to international branding in which the construct of brand mythology is central.",0
Mapping the Play of Organizational Identity in Foreign Market Adaptation,Journal of Marketing,2012,"While organizational identity can be a powerful tool for mobilizing and directing organizational members, the authors? findings demonstrate that it can also constrain the process of foreign market adaptation. Drawing from extensive ethnographic fieldwork in India, where they followed several multinational companies, they show how well-entrenched and enduring identities can obstruct the learning and strategic adjustments that are necessary to appeal to consumers in a new market environment. By explaining how organizational identity comes into play as a frame of reference and guiding principle, orienting managers in their efforts to preserve the character of their firm as it expands and globalizes, this research offers new insights into foreign market learning and adaptation. The authors extend this analysis to provide valuable recommendations to managers for making organizational identity a more explicit component of global marketing strategy.",0
"Using Single-Neuron Recording in Marketing: Opportunities, Challenges, and an Application to Fear Enhancement in Communications",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This article introduces the method of single-neuron recording in humans to marketing and consumer researchers. First, the authors provide a general description of this methodology, discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and describe findings from previous single-neuron human research. Second, they discuss the relevance of this method for marketing and consumer behavior and, more specifically, how it can be used to gain insights into the areas of categorization, sensory discrimination, reactions to novel versus familiar stimuli, and recall of experiences. Third, they present a study designed to illustrate how single-neuron studies are conducted and how data from them are processed and analyzed. This study examines people's ability to up-regulate (i.e., enhance) the emotion of fear, which has implications for designing effective fear appeals. The study shows that the firing rates of neurons previously shown to respond selectively to fearful content increased with emotion enhancement instructions, but only for a video that did not automatically evoke substantial fear. The authors discuss how the findings help illustrate which conclusions can and cannot be drawn from single-neuron research.",1
An Assessment of the Exporting Literature: Using Theory and Data to Identify Future Research Directions,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Exporting research is an established facet of the field of international marketing. That stated, the radical increase in recent export activity necessitates a sustained research effort devoted to the topic. In this article, the authors provide a qualitative review of the core theoretical exporting areas and evaluate the exporting domain quantitatively over six decades (1958?2016). For the quantitative analysis, they use multidimensional scaling and apply established bibliometric principles to offer an understanding of the field and to provide suggestions for future exporting research. For the evaluations, the authors used data from 830 articles with 52,191 citations from 35 journals. Using cocitation analysis as the basis to evaluate the data, they propose a series of intellectual structure implications on exporting that relate to internationalization process stages, dynamic capabilities, knowledge scarcity, social networks, export marketing strategy, absorptive capacity and learning, and nonlinear performance relationships involving marketing channel relationships.",0
A Review of Global Competitiveness Research: Past Advances and Future Directions,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"The global competitiveness (GC) literature has proven to be a developing, yet critical element in international marketing research. Broadly, GC studies have become a part of the marketing, international business, and strategic management fields. In light of this far-reaching topic and to gain a unique understanding of the dynamics across the GC domain, this study examines the intellectual structure of GC research at two distinct levels of analysis: overall GC publications and marketing and international business GC articles. This review of the literature uses cocitation data to provide insight to the field and develop a research-based model for future consideration. A total of 48 journals are included, providing 1,819 articles with 115,462 citations for examination. Applying multidimensional scaling to analyze the data, the study introduces a GC-focused model and provides possible topics for research. The proposed organizing framework includes elements of a market-based perspective (offering development, market orientation, and process emphasis), strategy implementation (firm-related advantages, strategic approach, and international focus), and performance to advance the critical nature of the marketing function in the GC literature.",0
Wearout or Weariness? Measuring Potential Negative Consequences of Online Ad Volume and Placement on Website Visits,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The global importance of online advertising calls for a detailed understanding of consumer-specific responses to online ad repetitions. A key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display degrees of ?wearout? but also whether they can surpass a point at which additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: ?weariness.? The authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model?s main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users? ad response. Analysis further suggests that an appropriate ?profiling and capping? strategy can improve ad deployment by as much as 15% overall for these data.",1
The Neglect of Prescreening Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Several studies show that information used to screen alternatives becomes less important than information acquired later in the search process simply because it was used to screen. Experiment 1 shows that the tendency to deemphasize prescreening information leads to systematically different choices for decision makers who screen alternatives compared with decision makers who do not screen alternatives. Additional studies show that screening encourages decision makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and 4). Together, the results show that a brand's strength of consideration (i.e., how highly an option ranks on screening criteria) may have little influence on the likelihood of it being chosen in a postscreening choice process.",1
The Impact of Standards Competition on Consumers: Effectiveness of Product Information and Advertising Formats,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Compared with other markets, those with competing technological standards exhibit certain fundamental characteristics that make a consumer's decision to adopt a new product more risky and more complex. This article examines how standards competition affects consumer behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements?negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion?disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3). This research takes a step toward a better understanding of these important but underexplored issues and provides managerial insights for firms that launch new products in markets with competing standards.",1
Analyst Earning Forecasts and Advertising and R&D Budgets: Role of Agency Theoretic Monitoring and Bonding Costs,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Because security analysts, who serve as brokers between public firms and investors, arrive at their forecasts by incorporating guidance from managers, there is immense pressure on the managers to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts; moreover, investors reward (penalize) firms for exceeding (missing) analyst forecasts. Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood. The authors also find that the unanticipated adjustments in advertising and R&D budgets adversely affect long-term firm returns and risk.",1
Customer Orientation Structure for Internet-Based Business-to-Business Platform Firms,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Internet-based business-to-business platforms involve a buyer side transacting with a seller side, both of which are customers of an intermediary platform firm. Dyadic viewpoints implicit in conventional theories of customer orientation thus must be modified to apply to a triadic relationship system (seller?platform?buyer) in platform settings. The authors propose that customer orientation of platform firms consists of total customer orientation (customer orientation toward both the buyer and seller sides) and customer orientation asymmetry (customer orientation in favor of the seller relative to the buyer side) and examine the antecedents and consequences of these orientations. Data from 109 business-to-business electronic platforms reveal that buyer- (seller-) side concentration increases total customer orientation and customer orientation asymmetry toward sellers (buyers). These positive effects are weaker when buyers and sellers interact directly (two-sided matching) versus indirectly (one-sided matching) and are stronger when the offering prices vary (dynamic price discovery) versus remain stable (static price discovery) during negotiations. Finally, total customer orientation increases platform performance by itself and in interaction with customer concentration, but orientation asymmetry increases performance only in conjunction with customer concentration.",0
Effect of Alliance Network Asymmetry on Firm Performance and Risk,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Persistent high failure rates of new product alliances call for identification of factors that might improve alliance outcomes. In this research, the authors identify two attributes of alliance network asymmetry that affect alliance performance and performance uncertainty: differences in the number of prealliance direct ties, which can create asymmetry in the volume of resources of the two firms, and differences in the interconnectivity among prealliance indirect ties, which leads the firms to possess different types of resources. The authors theorize that absolute levels of such asymmetries have curvilinear effects on alliance performance and performance uncertainty, which materialize as a focal firm?s abnormal returns and risk, respectively. They demonstrate that direct tie asymmetry has an inverted U-shaped effect on the focal firm?s abnormal returns and a U-shaped effect on its risk. Indirect tie asymmetry also has a U-shaped effect on the focal firm?s risk. However, the focal firm?s innovation quality and preexisting ties with its partner flatten these curvilinear effects. The findings have implications for partner selection in new product alliances.",0
Marketing Doctrine: A Principles-Based Approach to Guiding Marketing Decision Making in Firms,Journal of Marketing,2014,"The authors introduce and examine a new marketing concept that a small set of leading firms has begun to adopt: marketing doctrine. Marketing doctrine refers to a firm's unique principles, distilled from its experiences, which provide firm-wide guidance on market-facing choices. As such, marketing doctrine provides a firm-wide common approach to decision making. Importantly, marketing doctrine helps a firm address the classic consistency?flexibility conundrum by providing high-level guidance to all decision makers in the firm (thus ensuring consistency) but not specifying execution details (thus allowing for local flexibility). Across three samples, the authors explore the concept using a discovery-oriented, theories-in-use approach with 35 executives from several industries. This article makes four contributions. First, it offers a parsimonious definition of the marketing doctrine construct and contrasts it with related constructs. Second, it offers insight into how firms can develop marketing doctrine. Third, it develops a conceptual model that identifies the antecedents and consequences of marketing doctrine use. Finally, the authors explore the moderating effects of three unpredictable environments (competitive intensity, market turbulence, and structural flux) on the marketing doctrine use?performance relationship.",0
Proactive Postsales Service: When and why does it Pay Off?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Proactive postsales service (PPS) refers to a supplier taking the initiative to contact a customer to provide service after a sale is complete. It is argued that PPS leads to faster delivery of service to a broader cross-section of customers than customer-initiated postsales service, or reactive postsales service. The authors argue that mental frames of customers and suppliers engaged in PPS are more positive and open than mental frames of those engaged in customer-initiated service. On the basis of nine focus groups with 94 managers in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer settings, the authors propose three main dimensions of PPS: (1) proactive prevention, (2) proactive education, and (3) proactive feedback seeking. They argue that PPS leads not only to favorable customer-level outcomes (e.g., customer satisfaction) but also to favorable supplier-level outcomes (e.g., greater innovativeness, new product success rate). The authors propose that the value of PPS varies depending on the product's life-cycle stage, its transaction extensiveness, and network externality. In addition, the value of PPS varies depending on a customer's usage intensity, openness to experience, and market mavenism. Some key challenges with PPS pertain to implementation issues, such as privacy intrusion, expectation escalation, user identification, and contact routinization. If neglected, these can result in PPS leading to negative rather than positive outcomes. The authors develop guidelines for addressing these challenges and implementing PPS effectively in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts.",0
When Choosing Makes a Good Thing Better: Temporal Variations in the Valuation of Hedonic Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research investigates how the valuation of delayed consumption of hedonic products, such as concerts and chocolate, varies with the passage of time between choice and consumption. The authors find that when consumers make their own choices, they exhibit increases in evaluations of delayed consumption, but only if the interval between choice and consumption is relatively short. The effect attenuates over longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time. These effects depend on the extent of intrinsic motivation toward the object of consumption and occur only for consummatory consumption that is of inherent interest. Moreover, anticipatory increases in evaluations before consumption have ironic negative effects on postconsumption evaluations. The authors discuss implications and directions for further research.",1
Insincere Flattery Actually Works: A Dual Attitudes Perspective,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research uses a dual attitudes perspective to offer new insights into flattery and its consequences. The authors show that even when flattery by marketing agents is accompanied by an obvious ulterior motive that leads targets to discount the proffered compliments, the initial favorable reaction (the implicit attitude) continues to coexist with the discounted evaluation (the explicit attitude). Furthermore, the implicit attitude has more influential consequences than the explicit attitude, highlighting the possible subtle impact of flattery even when a person has consciously corrected for it. The authors also clarify the underlying process by showing how and why the discrepancy between the implicit and explicit attitudes induced by flattery may be reduced. Collectively, the findings from this investigation provide implications for both flattery research and the dual attitudes literature.",1
Consumer Responses to Service Failures: A Resource Preference Model of Cultural Influences,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"This article highlights consumers? preference for economic (versus social) resources in individualist (versus collectivist) cultures and demonstrates the multifaceted effects of culture on consumer responses to service failures. A cross-cultural study involving American and Chinese participants in the setting of a computer repair service confirms seven of eight hypotheses derived from the resource preference model. The results indicate that Americans (versus Chinese) are more dissatisfied with an outcome failure but less dissatisfied with a process failure. This interactive effect of culture and failure type seems to be driven by a corresponding pattern of attribution tendencies across cultures. Not only do Americans and Chinese differ in service dissatisfaction, but they also tend to express their dissatisfaction in different ways, preferring voice and private responses, respectively. Overall, the resource preference model enhances theoretical understanding of cross-cultural consumer behavior and provides culture-specific guidelines for managing the inevitable service failures.",0
Neural Profiling of Brands: Mapping Brand Image in Consumers? Brains with Visual Templates,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors demonstrate a novel template-based approach to profiling brand image using functional magnetic resonance imaging. They compare consumers? brain responses during passive viewing of visual templates (photos depicting various social scenarios) and brain responses during active visualizing of a brand's image, and then they generate individual neural profiles of brand image that correlate with the participant's own self-report perception of those consumer brands. In aggregate, these neural profiles of brand image are associated with perceived cobranding suitability and reflect brand image strength rated by a separate and bigger sample of consumers. This neural profiling approach offers a customizable tool for inspecting and comparing brand-specific mental associations, both across brands and across consumers. It also demonstrates the potential of using pattern analysis of neuroimaging data to study multisensory, nonverbal consumer knowledge and experience.",1
How Can Stressed Employees Deliver Better Customer Service? The Underlying Self-Regulation Depletion Mechanism,Journal of Marketing,2012,"This research delineates and empirically tests how regulatory depletion may affect high-stress employees' service performance on different types of job tasks. Using a laboratory experiment and a survey study, the authors examine (1) whether work stress causes a depletion effect, such that high work stress undermines service employees' performance on tasks requiring self-regulation (e.g., customer complaint handling performance) versus tasks requiring limited self-regulation (e.g., customer-directed extra-role performance); (2) whether the depletion effect can be overcome by supervisory support or employees' engagement in perspective taking; and (3) how these moderating effects might be mediated by employees' feelings of fatigue and intrinsic job motivation. The results confirm regulatory depletion: High-stress employees feel more fatigue and perform more poorly than low-stress employees in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, the depletion effect from work stress is largely attenuated on employees' performance on tasks requiring less or limited self-regulation. The mediated moderation tests further show that the extent of the depletion effect is not uniform. Employees who can replenish their resources from supervisory support or enhance their goal focus by engaging in perspective taking are less affected by regulatory depletion. These buffering effects occur because of enhanced intrinsic job motivation.",0
Is Customer Participation in Value Creation a Double-Edged Sword? Evidence from Professional Financial Services across Cultures,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Emergent perspectives in marketing highlight new opportunities for co-opting customers as a means to define and cocreate value through their participation. This study delineates and empirically tests hypotheses regarding the effects of customer participation (CP) on value creation and satisfaction for both customers and employees with different cultural value orientations in the context of professional financial services. Using data collected from 349 pairs of customers and service employees in two national groups (Hong Kong and the United States) of a global financial institution, this study examines how (1) CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of economic and relational values and (2) the effects of CP on value creation depend on participants? cultural value orientations. Promoting CP could be a double-edged sword for firms: CP enhances customers? economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between customers and employees, but it also increases employees? job stress and hampers their job satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of CP on value creation depend on the cultural values of both customers and service employees; this result implies that arranging customers and service employees with ?matched? cultural value orientations could facilitate the creation of value through CP.",0
Decomposing Promotional Effects with a Dynamic Structural Model of Flexible Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"In this article, the authors offer a methodology to decompose the effects of price promotions into brand switching, stockpiling, and change in consumption by explicitly allowing for consumer heterogeneity in brand preferences and consumption needs. They develop a dynamic structural model of a household that decides when, what, and how much to buy, as well as how much to consume, to maximize its expected utility over an infinite horizon. By making certain simplifying assumptions, the authors reduce the dimensionality of the problem. They estimate the proposed model using household purchase data in the canned tuna and paper towels categories. The results from the model offer insights into the decomposition of promotional effects into its components. This could help managers make inferences about which brand's sales are more responsive to stockpiling or increase in consumption expansion and how temporary price cuts affect future sales. Contrary to previous literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant force for the increase in sales. They show that brand-loyal consumers respond to a price promotion mainly by stockpiling for future consumption, whereas brand switchers do not stockpile at all. The authors also find that heavy users stockpile more, whereas light users mainly increase consumption when there is a price promotion.",1
Willingness to Pay and Competition in Online Auctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors model how to measure consumer willingness to pay (WTP) using an English, or ascending first-price, auction based on two general bidding premises: No bidder bids more than his or her WTP, and no bidder allows a rival bidder to win at a price that he or she is willing to beat. In other words, the authors propose a ?no-regret? rule in bidding. They impose no other restrictive assumptions on ?maximands? or the bidders' behaviors in a competitive auction context. The authors model WTP as having two components: a pure product feature component and one based on the auction market environment. The latter includes bidder experience, seller reputation, and measures for competition among bidders and items. The proposed model is general enough to include a ?buy-it-now? (equivalent to a posted price) auction mechanism. The authors use data on notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea. They find that most product characteristics matter in the expected ways. There are two additional primary findings: First, WTP declines as more similar items are concurrently listed with the focal item; there is an additional effect if these similar items also belong to the same brand. Therefore, market thickness matters for consumer WTP. Second, more extensive site surfing and bidding histories lead to lower WTP, implying that search costs and experience matter in bidding. As specific substantive benefits, the authors demonstrate how sellers can calculate changes in WTP and, thus, the expected revenue as the number of concurrently available similar items varies.",1
An Econometric Model of Location and Pricing in the Gasoline Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors propose an econometric model of both the geographic locations of gasoline retailers in Singapore and price competition among retailers conditional on their geographic locations. Although market demand for gasoline is not observed, the authors are able to infer the effects of such demand from stations? locations and pricing decisions using available data on local market-level demographics. Using the proposed location model, which is based on the assumption of social welfare maximization by a policy planner, the authors find that local potential gasoline demand depends positively on the local demographic characteristics of the neighborhood. Using the proposed pricing model, which is based on the assumption of Bertrand competition between retail chains, the authors find that retail margins for gasoline are approximately 21%. The authors also find that consumers are willing to travel up to a mile for a savings of $.03 per liter. Using the estimates of the proposed econometric model, the authors answer policy questions pertaining to a recent merger between two firms in the industry. Answering these questions has important policy implications for both gasoline firms and policy makers in Singapore.",1
Does In-Store Marketing Work? Effects of the Number and Position of Shelf Facings on Brand Attention and Evaluation at the Point of Purchase,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Recent trends in marketing have demonstrated an increased focus on in-store expenditures with the hope of ?grabbing consumers? at the point of purchase, but does this make sense? To help answer this question, the authors examine the interplay between in-store and out-of-store factors on consumer attention to and evaluation of brands displayed on supermarket shelves. Using an eye-tracking experiment, they find that the number of facings has a strong impact on evaluation that is entirely mediated by its effect on visual attention and works particularly well for frequent users of the brand, for low-market-share brands, and for young and highly educated consumers who are willing to trade off brand and price. They also find that gaining in-store attention is not always sufficient to drive sales. For example, top- and middle-shelf positions gain more attention than low-shelf positions; however, only top-shelf positions carry through to brand evaluation. The results underscore the importance of combining eye-tracking and purchase data to obtain a full picture of the effects of in-store and out-of-store marketing at the point of purchase.",0
Do Intentions Really Predict Behavior? Self-Generated Validity Effects in Survey Research,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Studies of the relationship between purchase intentions and purchase behavior have ignored the possibility that the very act of measurement may inflate the association between intentions and behavior, a phenomenon called ?self-generated validity.? In this research, the authors develop a latent model of the reactive effects of measurement that is applicable to intentions, attitude, or satisfaction data, and they show that this model can be estimated with a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, the authors use data from surveyed consumers to predict the presurvey latent purchase intentions of both surveyed and nonsurveyed consumers. In the second stage, they compare the strength of the association between the presurvey latent intentions and the postsurvey behavior across both groups. The authors find large and reliable self-generated validity effects across three diverse large-scale field studies. On average, the correlation between latent intentions and purchase behavior is 58% greater among surveyed consumers than it is among similar nonsurveyed consumers. One study also shows that the reactive effect of the measurement of purchase intentions is entirely mediated by self-generated validity and not by social norms, intention modification, or other measurement effects that are independent of presurvey latent intentions.",0
"Supersize in One Dimension, Downsize in Three Dimensions: Effects of Spatial Dimensionality on Size Perceptions and Preferences",Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Understanding consumer response to product supersizing and downsizing is important for policy makers, consumer researchers, and marketers. In three laboratory experiments and two field studies, the authors find that changes in size appear smaller when packages and portions change in all three spatial dimensions?height, width, and length?than when they change in only one dimension. Specifically, they show that size estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension). Finally, consumers expect (and marketers offer) steeper quantity discounts when products are supersized in three dimensions than when they are supersized in one dimension, regardless of whether size information is present.",1
When Are Stockpiled Products Consumed Faster? A Convenience?Salience Framework of Postpurchase Consumption Incidence and Quantity,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"When people stockpile products, how do they decide when and how much they will consume? To answer this question, the authors develop a framework that shows how the salience and convenience of products influence postpurchase consumption incidence and quantity. Multiple research methods?including scanner data analysis, a field study, and two laboratory studies?show that stockpiling increases product salience and triggers consumption incidence among high-convenience products. However, when the decision is made to consume a product, stockpiling increases the consumption quantity for both high- and low-convenience products. In addition to providing new insights on how consumers make postpurchase consumption decisions, these results have implications for the debate on the value of promotions that induce stockpiling.",1
How Biased Household Inventory Estimates Distort Shopping and Storage Decisions,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The authors develop a model of how consumers estimate the level of product inventory in their households. Two laboratory experiments and two field studies involving 29 product categories show that (1) consumers anchor their estimates on their average inventory and fail to adjust sufficiently; (2) adjustments follow an inelastic psychophysical power function, leading to overestimations of low levels of inventory and underestimations of high levels; and (3) adjustments are more elastic and, thus, more accurate when inventory is salient. Contrary to the assumptions of practitioners and academic modelers, these inventory estimates, not actual inventory levels, drive subsequent purchase incidence. Simulation results further show that biased estimates increase overstocking and spoilage among stockout-averse consumers but increase stockouts and unmet demand among overstocking-averse consumers. By predicting the magnitude, not just the direction, of estimation biases, the model and the results offer new insights into accelerating the consumption of healthy foods and improving the targeting of stockpiling-inducing sales promotions.",0
Is Obesity Caused by Calorie Underestimation? A Psychophysical Model of Meal Size Estimation,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Calorie underestimation is often alleged to contribute to obesity. By developing a psychophysical model of meal size estimation, the authors show that the association between body mass and calorie underestimation found in health science research is a spurious consequence of the tendency of high-body-mass people to choose?and thus estimate?larger meals. In four studies involving consumers and dieticians, the authors find that the calorie estimations of high- and low-body-mass people follow the same compressive power function; that is, they exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to meal size changes as the size of the meal increases. The authors also find that using a piecemeal decomposition improves calorie estimation and leads people to choose smaller, but equally satisfying, fast-food meals. The findings that biases in calorie estimation are caused by meal size and not body size have important implications for allegations against the food industry and for the clinical treatment of obesity.",1
A Benefit Congruency Framework of Sales Promotion Effectiveness,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Are monetary savings the only explanation for consumer response to a sales promotion? If not, how do the different consumer benefits of a sales promotion influence its effectiveness? To address the first question, this research builds a framework of the multiple consumer benefits of a sales promotion. Through a series of measurement studies, the authors find that monetary and nonmonetary promotions provide consumers with different levels of three hedonic benefits (opportunities for value expression, entertainment, and exploration) and three utilitarian benefits (savings, higher product quality, and improved shopping convenience). To address the second question, the authors develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues that a sales promotion's effectiveness is determined by the utilitarian or hedonic nature of the benefits it delivers and the congruence these benefits have with the promoted product. Among other results, two choice experiments show that, as predicted for high-equity brands, monetary promotions are more effective for utilitarian products than for hedonic products. The authors then discuss the implications of the multibenefit and the benefit congruency frameworks for understanding consumer responses to sales promotions, reexamining the value of everyday-low-price policies, and designing more effective sales promotions.",0
An Opportunity-Based View of Rapid Internationalization,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"This article aims to better understand patterns of rapid internationalization by using the emerging international entrepreneurship paradigm. This involves (1) taking an opportunity-based view (OBV) rather than just the firm as a focal point of analysis, (2) focusing on dynamic entrepreneurial processes, and (3) stressing the importance of history. The authors gathered empirical evidence from 15 case studies of small and medium-sized enterprises in Australia. They find support for the central proposition that behind the gradual or rapid internationalization process lies a path-dependent process of opportunity development and cross-border venturing activities that is shaped by the domestic and international networks in which the key actors and organizations have operated in the past and in which they are currently operating. The evidence leads the authors to question the notion that rapid internationalization is indeed rapid. Importantly, it reveals that rapid internationalization seems to be a truly rapid process only when not taking an OBV. In doing so, the authors demonstrate that the OBV is a fruitful avenue of enquiry to advance knowledge in this area and underscore the importance of the entrepreneurial process and firm history.",0
Getting a Grip on the Saddle: Chasms or Cycles?,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The ?saddle? is a sudden, sustained, and deep drop in sales of a new product, after a period of rapid growth following takeoff, followed by a gradual recovery to the former peak. The authors test for the generalizability of the saddle across products and countries and for three rival explanations: chasms in adopter segments, business cycles, and technological cycles. They model both boundary points of the saddle?start of the sales drop and recovery to the initial peak?using split-population models. Empirical analysis of historical sales data from ten products across 19 countries shows that the saddle is fairly pervasive. The onset of the saddle occurs in 148 product?country combinations. On average, the saddle occurs nine years after takeoff, at a mean penetration of 30%, and it lasts for eight years with a 29% drop in sales at its depth. The results support explanations of chasms and technological cycles for information/entertainment products and business cycles and technological cycles for kitchen/laundry products. The authors conclude with a discussion of the findings, contributions, and implications.",0
"Leapfrogging, Cannibalization, and Survival During Disruptive Technological Change: The Critical Role of Rate of Disengagement",Journal of Marketing,2020,"When faced with new technologies, the incumbents? dilemma is whether to embrace the new technology, stick with their old technology, or invest in both. The entrants? dilemma is whether to target a niche and avoid incumbent reaction or target the mass market and incur the incumbent?s wrath. The solution is knowing to what extent the new technology cannibalizes the old one or whether both technologies may exist in tandem. The authors develop a generalized model of the diffusion of successive technologies, which allows for the rate of disengagement from the old technology to differ from the rate of adoption of the new. A low rate of disengagement indicates people hold both technologies (coexistence), whereas a high rate of disengagement indicates they let go of the old technology in favor of the new (cannibalization). The authors test the validity of the model using a simulation of individual-level data. They apply the model to 660 technology pairs and triplets?country combinations from 108 countries spanning 70 years. Data include both penetration and sales plus important case studies. The model helps managers estimate evolving proportions of segments that play different roles in the competition between technologies and predict technological leapfrogging, cannibalization, and coexistence.",0
From Uncertain Intentions to Actual Behavior: A Threshold Model of Whether and When Salespeople Quit,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In this article, the authors focus on the formation of intentions to quit among salespeople and the link between these intentions and subsequent quitting behavior. Building on the foundations of the recently developed judgment uncertainty and magnitude parameters (JUMP) model, which statistically and simultaneously separates the drivers of judgment magnitude from those of judgment uncertainty, the authors present a model of the formation of uncertain intentions that decomposes a stated intention into a magnitude and an uncertainty dimension. The authors then develop hypotheses regarding the impact of affective and continuance commitment and critical sales events on intention magnitude and the effect of critical sales events and role stress on intention uncertainty. Subsequently, the authors develop a threshold model of the intention-behavior link that articulates a psychological mechanism within which uncertainty-laden intentions translate into actual behavior. Empirically, results from sales force intention and turnover data provide strong support for the theorizing. In addition to identifying some drivers of intention-to-quit magnitude and uncertainty, the authors identify the crucial role of intention uncertainty in shaping both the probability and timing of subsequent behavior. Consistent with the psychological underpinnings of the threshold model, the authors find that intention uncertainty lowers the probability of intended behavior. The results regarding the timing of quitting support an uncertainty avoidance conjecture: Given a stated intention, likely quitters with greater intention uncertainty quit faster than those with lower intention uncertainty.",1
Satisfaction Strength and Customer Loyalty,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Evidence reveals that many customers who state that they are satisfied with a service provider nevertheless defect. In this article, the authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters (JUMP) model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two related but independent facets?satisfaction level and satisfaction strength?and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction?loyalty link in a business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty). The studies also indicate that prior relationship aspects (length of relationship, volume of business, and favorability of prior experiences) result in even greater vulnerability.",1
From Invention to Innovation: Conversion Ability in Product Development,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The ability to convert inputs into outputs is a critical determinant of success in many fields of endeavor. In this research, the authors study the ability of firms to convert ideas into products, that is, their conversion ability. Specifically, they address the question, Why are some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between 1960 and 2001 from a cross-national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate for a moderate length of time on promising ideas.",1
"What Will the Future Bring? Dominance, Technology Expectations, and Radical Innovation",Journal of Marketing,2003,"Are dominant firms laggards or leaders at innovation? The answers to this question are conflicting and controversial. In an attempt to resolve conflicting answers to this question, the authors argue that dominance is a multifaceted construct in which individual facets result in differing (and countervailing) propensities to innovate. To identify the overall effects of dominance, it is necessary to consider the effects of these facets taken together. The authors also study a hitherto ignored yet important driver of innovation, technology expectations, and show that managers have widely divergent expectations of the same new technology. Furthermore, even when their expectations are the same, managers of dominant firms display investment behavior at odds with their counterparts at nondominant firms. The authors use a triangulation of research methods and combine insights from lab studies with those from field interviews, archival data, and a survey of bricks-and-mortar banks? responses to Internet banking.",0
"The Incumbent's Curse? Incumbency, Size, and Radical Product Innovation",Journal of Marketing,2000,"A common perception in the field of innovation is that large, incumbent firms rarely introduce radical product innovations. Such firms tend to solidify their market positions with relatively incremental innovations. They may even turn away entrepreneurs who come up with radical innovations, though they themselves had such entrepreneurial roots. As a result, radical innovations tend to come from small firms, the outsiders. This thesis, which we term the ?incumbent's curse,? is commonly accepted in academic and popular accounts of radical innovation. This topic is important, because radical product innovation is an engine of economic growth that has created entire industries and brought down giants while catapulting small firms to market leadership. Yet a review of the literature suggests that the evidence for the incumbent's curse is based on anecdotes and scattered case studies of highly specialized innovations. It is not clear if it applies widely across several product categories. The authors reexamine the incumbent's curse using a historical analysis of a relatively large number of radical innovations in the consumer durables and office products categories. In particular, the authors seek to answer the following questions: (1) How prevalent is this phenomenon? What percentage of radical innovations do incumbents versus nonincumbents introduce? What percentage of radical innovations do small firms versus large firms introduce? (2) Is the phenomenon a curse that invariably afflicts large incumbents in current industries? Is it driven by incumbency or size? and (3) How consistent is the phenomenon? Has the increasing size and complexity of firms over time accentuated it? Does it vary across national boundaries? Results from the study suggest that conventional wisdom about the incumbent's curse may not always be valid.",0
What to Say When: Advertising Appeals in Evolving Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors study how ad cues affect consumer behavior in new versus well-established markets. The authors use theoretical insights from consumer information processing to argue that the same ad cues can have different effects on consumer behavior, depending on whether the market is new or old. The authors then test these hypotheses in the context of a toll-free referral service, using a highly disaggregate econometric model of advertising response. The results indicate that argument-based appeals, expert sources, and negatively framed messages are particularly effective in new markets. Emotion-based appeals and positively framed messages are more effective in older markets than in new markets.",1
"Mirror, Mirror on the Retail Wall: Self-Focused Attention Promotes Reliance on Feelings in Consumer Decisions",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors propose that consumers? increased self-focused attention promotes their relative reliance on affective feelings when they make decisions. The authors test this hypothesis in a variety of consumption domains and decision tasks, including real-life, consequential charitable donations. Consistent support from five experiments with more than 1,770 participants shows that (1) valuations of the decision outcome increase when consumers with high (low) self-focus adopt a feeling-based (reason-based) strategy. The hypothesized effect of self-focus on relative reliance on feelings in decision making is (2) moderated by self-construal. Furthermore, greater attention to the self (3) increases evaluations of products that are affectively superior but (4) decreases evaluations of products that are affectively inferior and (5) exerts little influence on evaluations of products that are less affective in nature (i.e., utilitarian products). Finally, self-focused attention (6) amplifies a decision bias typically attributed to feeling-based judgments, known as scope-insensitivity bias, in a hypothetical laboratory study and in a real-life, consequential charitable donation. Theoretical and marketing implications are discussed.",1
The Influence of Institutional Forces on International Joint Ventures? Foreign Parents? Opportunism and Relationship Extendedness,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Institutional forces influence the formation of international joint ventures (IJVs) in emerging economies and shape both their parents? behaviors and their marketing strategies. Whereas previous research has centered on governance mechanisms that deter opportunism, this study investigates the influence of institutional forces (i.e., rule of law, government intervention, and dysfunctional competition) on the IJV's foreign parent's opportunism. The authors find that rule of law and dysfunctional competition curtail opportunism, whereas government intervention drives opportunism. In addition, relationships between institutional forces in local markets and the IJV's foreign parent's opportunism depend on the IJV's marketing capability. The authors further examine the influence of the foreign parent's opportunism on IJV relationship extendedness and find support for a negative relationship between opportunism and the IJV's continuity. This study enriches institutional theory and identifies the boundary of the influence of institutional forces on opportunism. Because opportunism is a critical relationship hazard, the findings of this study have important implications for IJVs? partnership management.",0
The Effectiveness of Customer Participation in New Product Development: A Meta-Analysis,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Although the returns of customer participation on new product development (NPD) performance can vary substantially, the current literature lacks a systematic conceptual and empirical integration showing when customer participation is valuable in enhancing NPD performance. Building on knowledge management theory, the authors present a conceptual framework that synthesizes a variety of contingency factors. A meta-analysis empirically examines the moderating effects of contextual factors between customer participation and NPD performance. The analysis reveals that involving customers in the ideation and launch stages of NPD improves new product financial performance directly as well as indirectly through acceleration of time to market, whereas customer participation in the development phase slows down time to market, deteriorating new product financial performance. Furthermore, the benefits of customer participation on NPD performance are greater in technologically turbulent NPD projects, in emerging countries, in low-tech industries, for business customers, and for small firms. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications about when to engage customers in the innovation process.",0
Selling to Barricaded Buyers,Journal of Marketing,2019,"In business-to-government and business-to-business transactions, suppliers often have limited access to buyers during the buying process. The authors term these buyers ?barricaded buyers.? Despite the prevalence of barricaded buyers in practice, research has remained largely silent on the topic. Therefore, the authors combine insights from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and, correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect suppliers? competitiveness.",0
Managing the Gray Market in the European Union: The Case of the Pharmaceutical Industry,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"The emergence of significant trade blocks, such as the European Union (EU) and the North American Free Trade Agreement, has established the need for studies on managerial strategies to effectively circumvent gray markets in these regional marketplaces. Therefore, this article reviews the necessary market conditions required to foster gray markets by specifically exploring the regulated price and legal environments of the pharmaceutical industry in the EU. The article addresses the significance of, and relationship between, Articles 30 (promoting the free movement of goods within the EU) and 36 (permitting limits on imports and exports in certain cases) of the EU Treaty. Relevant decisions of the European Court of Justice are summarized and analyzed, with particular emphasis on those applying the Exhaustion of Rights Doctrine established in the 1974 landmark case of Centrafarm v. Sterling Drug. The article also examines the limits that the European courts have placed on the doctrine and suggest possible tactics that may be employed by pharmaceutical managers attempting to curtail the distribution of gray market pharmaceuticals.Also addressed are managerial perceptions regarding gray markets in the EU by means of personal interviews with 13 multinational pharmaceutical firms. Four principal themes emerged in the interviews on the topic of parallel imports: the degree to which a firm's exposure to gray markets varies in the EU; the current consolidation of wholesalers to bolster parallel imports; national governments? overt or covert condonation of parallel imports to reduce the national drug bill; and the lack of managerial control to prevent gray markets. In this connection, the article concludes with a discussion of various anti-gray marketing strategies to facilitate managerial control in this trade block. In general, the manager must employ strategic links between the regulated price and legal framework governing the pharmaceutical marketing environment in the EU with various anti-gray marketing strategies such as supply interference, product differentiation, and marketing information systems.",0
The Chain of Effects from Brand Trust and Brand Affect to Brand Performance: The Role of Brand Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2001,"The authors examine two aspects of brand loyalty, purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty, as linking variables in the chain of effects from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance (market share and relative price). The model includes product-level, category-related controls (hedonic value and utilitarian value) and brand-level controls (brand differentiation and share of voice). The authors compile an aggregate data set for 107 brands from three separate surveys of consumers and brand managers. The results indicate that when the product- and brand-level variables are controlled for, brand trust and brand affect combine to determine purchase loyalty and attitudinal loyalty. Purchase loyalty, in turn, leads to greater market share, and attitudinal loyalty leads to a higher relative price for the brand. The authors discuss the managerial implications of these results.",0
Investigating Effects of Out-of-Stock on Consumer Stockkeeping Unit Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Out-of-stock (OOS) is commonly observed in the retail environment with consumer packaged goods, but there have been few empirical studies of the effects of OOS on consumer product choice, because there is a lack of OOS information during households' purchase occasions. The authors study the effects of OOS on consumer stockkeeping unit (SKU) preference and price sensitivity, using a unique data set from multiple consumer packaged goods categories with information on recurring OOS incidents. They obtain several substantive findings: (1) Consumers' price sensitivity tends to be underestimated when OOS is not accounted for in a discrete choice model; (2) for consumers who have shorter interpurchase time, their preference for a SKU is attenuated when it is frequently OOS; and (3) for consumers who purchase from a small number of SKUs, their preference for a SKU is reinforced when facing OOS of other similar SKUs, whereas it is attenuated when facing OOS of other similar and also frequently purchased SKUs. The authors also illustrate that their findings can help retailers evaluate the effect of OOS on category revenue and predict time-varying market shares of SKUs in periods following OOS incidents.",1
?Speed of Replacement?: Modeling Brand Loyalty Using Last-Move Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors study brand loyalties for durable goods using automobile survey data that are peculiarly censored and track only elapsed times since transitions but not the transition times themselves. This censoring problem is typical of commercially available durable goods survey data. However, little attention has been paid to such ?last-move? data in the statistics or marketing literature on the analysis of transition times. The authors propose a multistate, continuous-time, nonstationary Markov model with a parsimonious brand loyalty structure and also propose an estimation approach to recover the parameters of the proposed model using the automobile survey data. The proposed model fits observed brand choice outcomes even better than a model with a fully unrestricted (and, therefore, highly parameterized) transition structure. The authors also obtain several substantive findings. For example, Chrysler is significantly ?weaker? than General Motors and Ford insofar as it has the lowest brand loyalty during the study period. The authors illustrate the managerial implications by predicting time-varying market shares of brands in periods subsequent to the period of analysis.",1
"Bounded Rationality in Pricing under State-Dependent Demand: Do Firms Look Ahead, and if So, How Far?",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors propose an empirical procedure to investigate the pricing behavior of manufacturers and retailers in the presence of state-dependent demand. Rather than assuming that firms are perfectly forward looking and therefore solving accordingly for dynamic equilibriums that would arise in the presence of state dependence, the authors systematically evaluate whether boundedly rational firms indeed look ahead when they set prices and, if so, to what extent. They illustrate the procedure using household-level scanner-panel data on breakfast cereals and replicate the substantive results using data on ketchup. The authors find that (1) omission of state dependence in demand biases inference of firm behavior (i.e., tacit collusion is erroneously inferred when firms are competitive); (2) observed retail prices are consistent with a pricing model in which both manufacturers and retailers are forward looking (i.e., they incorporate the effects of their current prices on their future profits), but firms have short time horizons when setting prices (i.e., they look ahead by only one period, suggesting that firms are boundedly rational in their dynamic pricing behavior); and (3) even a myopic pricing model of firms that accounts for state dependence in demand is a reasonable approximation of the observed prices in the market.",1
The Effect of Goal Visualization on Goal Pursuit: Implications for Consumers and Managers,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This research demonstrates that as people approach a goal, external representations, which increase the ease of visualizing the goal, enhance goal pursuit. Specifically, consumers judge easy-to-visualize goals to be closer than difficult-to-visualize goals, which in turn increases effort and commitment. Ease of visualization affects performance in swimming competitions and the physical effort exerted in the lab. Visualization also affects commitment toward savings, willingness to wait for service, and performance in a simulated sales task. Importantly, the beneficial effects of visualization exist only when people are close to the goal. In addition, the effect of visualization attenuates when the goal is split into subgoals. Managers can use these results to enhance consumer goal pursuit, influence consumer satisfaction in online service encounters, and motivate employees to improve performance. In these varied contexts, visual representations of goal progress (e.g., progress bars) enhance motivation as people approach their goal.",0
The Effect of Need for Uniqueness on Word of Mouth,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research examines the psychosocial cost associated with positive word of mouth (WOM), which can decrease the uniqueness of possessions and thus harm high-uniqueness consumers (pilot study). As a result, high- (versus low-) uniqueness consumers are less willing to generate positive WOM for publicly consumed products that they own. However, high uniqueness does not decrease willingness to generate WOM for privately consumed products (Study 1). Study 2 demonstrates that for publicly consumed products, WOM that includes positive recommendations is more persuasive than WOM that only contains product details. Consequently, the effect of uniqueness is more pronounced for WOM recommendations than for WOM that only provides details (Study 3). Study 4 confirms that high- (versus low-) uniqueness consumers are less willing to recommend a public product to others but are equally willing to discuss product details. Study 5 analyzes real-world WOM content and finds evidence in support of these results.",1
Anytime versus Only: Mind-Sets Moderate the Effect of Expansive versus Restrictive Frames on Promotion Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Three studies demonstrate that the framing of redemption windows as expansive or restrictive, with the actual length of the window held constant, influences consumers' evaluations of sales promotions. When feasibility concerns are highlighted (i.e., an implemental mind-set), consumers prefer the expansive (?anytime?) to the restrictive (?only?) frame. However, consumers in a deliberative mind-set prefer the restrictive (only) frame to the expansive (anytime) frame. Study 1 reveals that whereas the former consumers attend more to their ability to redeem the offer, the latter are influenced more by the precision of the offer. Study 2 highlights the mediating role of these inferences on consumers' likelihood of taking advantage of the offer. Study 3 demonstrates the impact of these frames on real-world coupon redemption. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope of this framing effect, the implications of the findings, and directions for further research.",1
Influence of Warm versus Cool Temperatures on Consumer Choice: A Resource Depletion Account,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Across five studies, the authors demonstrate that warm (vs. cool) temperatures deplete resources, increase System 1 processing, and influence performance on complex choice tasks. Real-world lottery data (pilot study) and a lab experiment (Study 1) demonstrate the effect of temperature on complex choices: People are less likely to make difficult gambles in warmer temperatures. Study 2 implicates resource depletion as the underlying process; warm temperatures lower cognitive performance for nondepleted people but do not affect the performance of depleted people. Study 3 illustrates the moderating role of task complexity to show that warm temperatures are depleting and decrease willingness to make a difficult product choice. Study 4 juxtaposes the effects of depletion and temperature to reveal that warm temperatures hamper performance on complex tasks because of the participants? increased reliance on System 1 (heuristic) processing.",1
The Effects of Cultural Individualism and Self-Confidence on Propensity to Voice: From Theory to Measurement to Practice,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This article examines the effects of cultural individualism on consumers? propensity to voice and the mediating effects of self-confidence. The authors explore these relationships in the United States and South Korea to assess whether a consumer's culture, measured as an individual difference variable, is as an explanatory variable for propensity to voice in the context of dissatisfactory marketplace experiences. They find that individualism has a positive effect on propensity to voice at the pancountry and intracountry levels and that self-confidence fully mediates the relationship between individualism and propensity to voice. The results have important implications for understanding consumer complaining behavior for organizations that serve culturally diverse consumer groups.",0
How Does Team Composition Affect Effort in Contests? A Theoretical and Experimental Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"When companies organize salespeople into teams to compete with one another, how does the ability composition of team members affect effort? And how may the effect of team composition on effort depend on the type of contest the teams are competing in? Using a game-theoretic model, we derive the very sharp predictions that when winning the contest depends on the average team sales, the ability composition of a team has no effect on team effort, and the stronger and weaker members will expend identical effort levels. However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort. Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average metric elicits the highest team effort. We also discuss cases when the minimum and maximum metrics are optimal. We test the model's empirical validity using two incentive-aligned experiments in which participants make effort decisions strategically. The experimental results exhibit broad support for the theoretical predictions.",1
When more is Less: The Impact of Base Value Neglect on Consumer Preferences for Bonus Packs over Price Discounts,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The interpretation of a percentage change often hinges on the base value to which it is attached. The authors identify a tendency among consumers to neglect base values when processing percentage change information and investigate the implications of such base value neglect for how consumers evaluate economically equivalent offers presented in percentage terms, such as bonus packs and price discounts. The authors first document a substantial advantage in sales volume for a bonus pack over an economically equivalent price discount in a field experiment conducted in a retail store. Furthermore, in a mall-intercept survey and multiple lab studies, the authors provide additional evidence in support of the effect and identify managerially useful boundary conditions for when the effect is likely to manifest. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.",0
Cultural Differences in Consumer Impatience,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In this article, the authors examine cross-cultural variations in how people discount the future. Specifically, they predict that people from Western cultures are relatively less patient and therefore discount the future to a greater degree than do people from Eastern cultures, and thus Westerners value immediate consumption relatively more. Furthermore, on the basis of regulatory focus theory, the authors predict that when Easterners are faced with the threat of a delay in receiving a product (i.e., a prevention loss), they are more impatient, whereas when Westerners are faced with the threat of not being able to enjoy a product early (i.e., a promotion loss), their impatience increases. This enhanced impatience manifests in preference for expedited consumption of a product purchased online in two studies. In both studies, the authors used a priming methodology on ?bicultural? Singaporean participants; the results support the predictions. In the second study, they also found evidence in support of the process-based explanation for the interaction between culture and message framing.",1
Auctioning Keywords in Online Search,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Keyword advertising, or ?sponsored links? that appear alongside online search results or other online content, has grown into a multibillion-dollar market. Providers of keyword advertising, such as Google and Yahoo, profit by auctioning keywords to advertisers. An issue of increasing importance for advertising providers is the ?share structure? problem?that is, of the total available resources for each keyword (in terms of exposure), how large a share should be set aside for the highest bidder, for the second-highest bidder, and so on. The authors study this problem under a general specification and characterize the optimal share structures that maximize advertising providers? revenues. They also derive results on how the optimal share structure should change with advertisers? price elasticity of demand for exposure, their valuation distribution, total resources, and minimum bids. The authors draw implications for keyword auctions and other applications.",0
Nonlinear Effects of Dynamic Export Pricing on Export Sales: A Longitudinal Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Little is known in the literature about dynamic export pricing, and particularly how the external environment interacts with a firm?s export pricing decisions and its long-term effect on export sales. Therefore, this study develops a longitudinal framework to examine the quadratic effect of dynamic export pricing and its interaction with customer/competitive turbulence on export sales. By employing product-level longitudinal data, the authors also estimate the lagged effect from past dynamic export pricing and export sales while simultaneously controlling for endogeneity and unknown firm heterogeneity. The results indicate that dynamic export pricing appears to have inverted quadratic effects on export sales; this quadratic relationship is moderated by customer turbulence and competitive turbulence. The authors also focus on the changes of the curve and shifts of the turning point and delineate the fit lines that pinpoint the optimal dynamic export pricing in different export markets. Finally, previous actions and outcomes significantly influence the following year?s export sales, which explains the long-term relationships.",0
"Strategic Orientation, Foreign Parent Control, and Differentiation Capability Building of International Joint Ventures in an Emerging Market",Journal of International Marketing,2014,"This article examines how strategic orientation and foreign parent control jointly affect differentiation capability building of international joint ventures (IJVs) in an emerging market. With a multisource data set of 156 IJVs in China, the authors find that technology and customer orientations have a positive effect on IJV differentiation capability and that such effects are contingent on foreign parent control. Technology orientation leads to stronger differentiation capability when foreign equity control is higher or operational control is greater. In contrast, customer orientation is more beneficial for differentiation capability building when foreign operational control is lower or social control is greater.",0
The Impact of Sampling and Network Topology on the Estimation of Social Intercorrelations,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"With the growing popularity of online social networks, it is becoming more important for marketing researchers to understand and measure social intercorrelations among consumers. The authors show that the estimation of consumers' social intercorrelations can be significantly affected by the sampling method used in the study and the topology of the social network. Through a series of simulation studies using a spatial model, the authors find that the magnitude of social intercorrelations in consumer networks tends to be underestimated if samples of the networks are used (rather than using the entire population of the network). The authors further demonstrate that sampling methods that better preserve the network structure perform best in recovering the social intercorrelations. However, this advantage decreases in networks characterized by the scale-free power-law distribution for the number of connections of each member. The authors discuss the insights they glean from these findings and propose a method to obtain unbiased estimation of the magnitude of social intercorrelations.",1
Learning from a Service Guarantee Quasi Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors analyze data from a service guarantee program implemented by a midpriced hotel chain. Using a multisite regression discontinuity quasi-experimental design developed over 16 months, they control for unobserved heterogeneity among guests and treatments across hotels and develop Bayesian posterior estimates of the varying program effect for each hotel. The results contribute to theory and practice. First, they provide new insights into how service guarantee programs operate in the field. Specifically, the guarantee was more effective at hotels with a better prior service history and an easier-to-serve guest population, which is consistent with signaling arguments but does not comport with the incentive argument that guarantees actually improve service quality. Second, the results offer managers better decision rules. Specifically, the authors devise program continuation rules that are sensitive to both observed and unobserved differences across sites. In addition, they devise policies to reward hotels that exceed site-specific expectations. By controlling for observed and unobserved differences across sites, the authors show that these policies potentially reward even hotels with negative net program effects, which is useful in reducing the organizational stigma of failure. Finally, the authors identify sites that should be targeted for future program rollout by computing the odds of succeeding.",1
Uncovering the Importance of Relationship Characteristics in Social Networks: Implications for Seeding Strategies,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Seeding influential social network members is crucial for the success of a viral marketing campaign and product diffusion. In line with the assumption that connections between customers in social networks are binary (either present or absent), previous research has generally recommended seeding network members who are well-connected. However, the importance of connections between customers varies substantially depending on the relationship's characteristics, such as its type (i.e., friend, colleague, or acquaintance), duration, and interaction intensity. This research introduces a new Bayesian methodology to identify influential network members and takes into account the relative influence of different relationship characteristics on product diffusion. Two applications of the proposed methodology?the launch of a microfinance program across 43 Indian villages and information propagation in a large online social network?demonstrate the importance of weighting connections in social networks. Compared with traditional seeding strategies, the proposed methodology recommends substantially different sets of seeds that increased the reach by up to 10% in the first empirical application and up to 92% in the second.",1
Does a Firm's Product-Recall Strategy Affect Its Financial Value? An Examination of Strategic Alternatives during Product-Harm Crises,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Product-harm crises often result in product recalls, which can have a significant impact on a firm's reputation, sales, and financial value. In managing the recall process, some firms adopt a proactive strategy in responding to consumer complaints, while others are more passive. In this study, the authors examine the impact of these strategic alternatives on firm value using Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls during a 12-year period from 1996 to 2007. Using the event study method, the authors show that regardless of firm and product characteristics, proactive strategies have a more negative effect on firm value than more passive strategies. An explanation for this surprising result is that the stock market interprets proactive strategies as a signal of substantial financial losses to the firm. When a firm proactively manages a product recall, the stock market infers that the consequence of the product-harm crisis is sufficiently severe that the firm had no choice but to act swiftly to reduce potential financial losses. Therefore, firms dealing with product recalls must be sensitive to how investors might interpret a proactive strategy and be aware of its potential drawbacks.",0
Media Coverage of Climate Change and Sustainable Product Consumption: Evidence from the Hybrid Vehicle Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"As sustainable consumption becomes increasingly important, firms must better understand the drivers behind the consumption of these products. This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data, the authors provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase. They provide implications for theory and practice and call for future research that examines the causal impact of media in general on consumer decisions, especially in domains that are crucial for the society.",1
Improving Cancer Outreach Effectiveness Through Targeting and Economic Assessments: Insights from a Randomized Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10?20 (13?24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients? demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%?96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.",0
When do Third-Party Product Reviews Affect Firm Value and what can Firms Do? The Case of Media Critics and Professional Movie Reviews,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Third-party product reviews (TPRs) have become ubiquitous in many industries. Aided by communication technologies, particularly on the Internet, TPRs are widely available to consumers, managers, and investors. The authors examine whether and how TPRs of new products influence the financial value of firms introducing the products. An event study covering 14 major media and professional reviews of movies released by 21 studios shows that TPRs exert significant impact on stock returns in the direction of their valence. However, the impact comes from the valence of a review that is measured relative to other, previously published reviews and not from the absolute valence of the review itself. The authors further study the dynamics of TPR impact on firm value and find that the impact exists only for prerelease reviews and is the strongest on the product release date, though it disappears when sales information becomes available after product release. These results demonstrate that TPRs play significant roles as the investors update their expectation about new product sales potential. The authors also find that advertising spending increases the positive impact of TPRs on firm value and buffer the negative impact. Therefore, firms could strategically use marketing instruments such as advertising to moderate the impact of TPRs.",0
Investigating the Academic Performance and Disciplinary Consequences of School District Internet Access Spending,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Public school districts not only make strategic investments in internet access as a means to attract and retain students but also communicate the value of these investments with parents as part of their marketing programs. While it helps attract more customers, how does school district internet access spending (SDIAS) affect academic performance and disciplinary problems among students? Using a longitudinal data set that combines SDIAS of 1,243 school districts with academic performance and disciplinary records of more than 9,000 Texas public schools between 2000 and 2014, the authors find that a one-standard-deviation increase in SDIAS (an average increase of $.6 million) is associated with an improvement in eight academic performance indicators, with effect sizes ranging from 2% to 5% of a standard deviation, amounting to a $.8 million to $1.8 million increase in cumulative income for the current students of a school district. Furthermore, a one-standard-deviation increase in SDIAS is associated with a 5% increase in Part II offense?related school disciplinary problems, amounting to a yearly cost of $25,800 to $53,440 for a school district. The positive and negative consequences of SDIAS are more pronounced among schools in regions with a higher level of household internet access.",1
Modeling Credit Card Share of Wallet: Solving the Incomplete Information Problem,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Despite the powerful technologies that have enabled the assembly of transactional databases and the processing of information about individual customers and their buying patterns, database marketers have been limited by what is known as the ?incomplete information problem??that is, marketers have incomplete information about a customer's behavior in the product category of interest. A company's transactional database can only be built from customers' transactions with that company. Any transactions that have been made with other companies are missing. The authors present a modeling approach designed to solve the incomplete information problem. They use transactions conducted with a single supplier in that category to infer consumers' behavior with other suppliers in that category. In particular, armed with prior knowledge of the parametric form of consumer interpurchase time distributions, they uncover elements of the stochastic process that dictates which supplier a consumer chooses on a particular purchase occasion. The authors focus on interpurchase times because they form the core of the incomplete information problem. If a company uses its observed interpurchase times to estimate interpurchase times in the category for a specific consumer, its estimate will be biased upward. Combined with the model developed in this study, a familiar analysis of transaction profitability can be used to build a new type of lifetime value: lifetime category value of the customer.",1
Online Social Interactions: A Natural Experiment on Word of Mouth versus Observational Learning,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Consumers? purchase decisions can be influenced by others? opinions, or word of mouth (WOM), and/or others? actions, or observational learning (OL). Although information technologies are creating increasing opportunities for firms to facilitate and manage these two types of social interaction, to date, researchers have encountered difficulty in disentangling their competing effects and have provided limited insights into how these two social influences might differ from and interact with each other. Using a unique natural experimental setting resulting from information policy shifts at the online seller Amazon.com, the authors design three longitudinal, quasi-experimental field studies to examine three issues regarding the two types of social interaction: (1) their differential impact on product sales, (2) their lifetime effects, and (3) their interaction effects. An intriguing finding is that while negative WOM is more influential than positive WOM, positive OL information significantly increases sales, but negative OL information has no effect. This suggests that reporting consumer purchase statistics can help mass-market products without hurting niche products. The results also reveal that the sales impact of OL increases with WOM volume.",1
Estimating Disaggregate Models using Aggregate Data through Augmentation of Individual Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"In this article, the authors propose a Bayesian method for estimating disaggregate choice models using aggregate data. Compared with existing methods, the advantage of the proposed method is that it allows for the analysis of microlevel consumer dynamic behavior, such as the impact of purchase history on current brand choice, when only aggregate-level data are available. The essence of this approach is to simulate latent choice data that are consistent with the observed aggregate data. When the augmented choice data are made available in each iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the dynamics of consumer buying behavior can be explicitly modeled. The authors first demonstrate the validity of the method with a series of simulations and then apply the method to an actual store-level data set of consumer purchases of refrigerated orange juice. The authors find a significant amount of dynamics in consumer buying behavior. The proposed method is useful for managers to understand better the consumer purchase dynamics and brand price competition when they have access to aggregate data only.",1
From ?Where? to ?What?: Distributed Representations of Brand Associations in the Human Brain,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of humanlike characteristics associated with brands, referred to as ?brand personality.? The authors combine newly available machine learning techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers? minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from work focused on cataloging brain regions associated with marketing stimuli to testing and refining constructs central to theories of consumer behavior.",1
Temporal Contiguity and Negativity Bias in the Impact of Online Word of Mouth,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Prior research shows that positive online reviews are less valued than negative reviews. The authors argue that this is due to differences in causal attributions for positive versus negative information such that positive reviews tend to be relatively more attributed to the reviewer (vs. product experience) than negative reviews. The presence of temporal contiguity cues, which indicate that review writing closely follows consumption, reduces the relative extent to which positive reviews are attributed to the reviewer and mitigates the negativity bias. An examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review value is negatively related to review valence but that this negative relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity cues. A series of lab studies replicates these findings and suggests that temporal contiguity cues enhance the value of a positive review and increase the likelihood of choosing a product with a positive review by changing reader beliefs about the cause of the review.",1
Double Mental Discounting: When a Single Price Promotion Feels Twice as Nice,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This research finds that when a single gain has strong associations with multiple costs, consumers often mentally deduct that gain from perceived costs multiple times. For example, with some price promotions (e.g., spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future), consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost of the first purchase when they receive the promotion, as well as from the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon, referred to as ?double mental discounting,? is driven by the extent to which gains feel associated, or coupled, with multiple purchases. This article also documents methods to decouple promotional gains from purchases, thus mitigating double mental discounting.",1
Do Costly Options Lead to Better Outcomes? How the Protestant Work Ethic Influences the Cost?Benefit Heuristic in Goal Pursuit,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"People often assume that costlier means lead to better outcomes, even in the absence of an objective relationship in the specific context. Such cost?benefit heuristics in goal pursuit have been observed across several domains, but their antecedents have not been fully explored. In this research, the authors propose that a person's tendency to use cost?benefit heuristics depends on the extent to which that person subscribes to the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), an influential concept originally introduced to explain the rise of capitalism. The PWE is a core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to overgeneralize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are more likely to use cost?benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes. Suggestions are provided for how marketers may identify consumers high versus low in PWE and tailor their offerings accordingly.",1
The Role of Purchase Quantity in Assortment Choice: The Quantity-Matching Heuristic,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Consumers often purchase multiple items from a product category on a single shopping trip. In doing so, they must frequently choose among items that are grouped in assortments, such as those offered by a particular store or brand. This article examines how the number of to-be-purchased items influences consumer choice among assortments. It is argued that when consumers are uncertain about their preferences, they are more likely to prefer an assortment for which the number of available options matches the desired purchase quantity. This prediction is based on the notion that a match between the size of an assortment and the number of to-be-purchased items enables consumers to simplify the selection process by eliminating the need to trade off the benefits and costs of individual choice alternatives?a strategy referred to as the ?quantity-matching heuristic.? The theoretical predictions are supported by data from five empirical studies that offer converging evidence for the role of purchase-quantity goals in assortment choice and identify moderating factors and boundary conditions.",1
The Role of Market Efficiency Intuitions in Consumer Choice: A Case of Compensatory Inferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors examine consumer inferences about product attributes that are unobservable at the time of the decision. Extant research predicts that in the absence of an explicit correlation between product attributes, consumers will infer that the brand that is superior on the observable attributes is also superior on the unobservable attributes. The authors propose an alternative inference strategy that makes the counterintuitive prediction that the apparently superior brand is inferior on the unobservable attributes. The authors refer to these inferences as ?compensatory inferences? and assert that they are associated with consumers' intuitive theories about the competitive nature of a market. In a series of four experiments, the authors examine the occurrence of compensatory inferences and compare them with other inference strategies.",1
Assortment Size and Option Attractiveness in Consumer Choice among Retailers,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"An important decision that retailers make involves selecting the number of items constituting their assortments. A key issue in making these decisions is the role of assortment size in determining consumers? choice of a retailer. The authors address this issue by investigating how consumer choice among retailers offering various-sized assortments is influenced by the attractiveness of the options constituting these assortments. The data show that consumer preference for retailers offering larger assortments tends to decrease as the attractiveness of the options in their assortments increases and can even lead to a reversal of preferences in favor of retailers offering smaller assortments. This research further presents evidence that the relationship between assortment size and option attractiveness is concave, such that the marginal impact of assortment size on choice decreases as the attractiveness of the options increases. Data from eight empirical studies offer converging evidence in support of the theoretical predictions.",1
Competing for Consumer Identity: Limits to Self-Expression and the Perils of Lifestyle Branding,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The idea that consumers use brands to express their identities has led many companies to reposition their products from focusing on functional attributes to focusing on how they fit into a consumer's lifestyle. This repositioning is welcomed by managers who believe that by positioning their brands as means for self-expression, they are less likely to go head-to-head with their direct competitors. However, the authors argue that by doing so, these companies expose themselves to much broader, cross-category competition for a share of a consumer's identity. Thus, they propose that consumers? need for self-expression through brands is finite and can be satiated when consumers are exposed to self-expressive brands. Moreover, they argue that consumers? need for self-expression can be satiated not only by a brand's direct competitors but also by brands from unrelated product categories, nonbrand means of self-expression, and self-expressive behavioral acts. The authors examine these propositions in a series of five empirical studies that provide converging evidence in support of the notion that the need for self-expression can be satiated, thus weakening preferences for lifestyle brands.",0
Social Capital and its Influence on Changes in Internationalization Mode among Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This article explores how social capital influences a firm to change its internationalization mode. The authors use an in-depth qualitative study to identify 36 internationalization mode changes in ten New Zealand and ten Swedish small and medium-sized enterprises. This article contributes to the internationalization mode literature by focusing on relationships and mode change. Using the network approach, the authors develop three categories of social capital and discuss their role in influencing mode change. The roles include the efficacy role, the serendipity role, and the liability role of social capital. These three roles incorporate both the positive and the negative aspects of social capital. The liability role is the most frequently observed form of social capital to influence mode change. The most frequent type of mode change is toward a high-control internationalization mode.",0
A Strategic Approach to Internationalization: A Traditional versus a ?Born-Global? Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This article is based on a study of 16 in-depth case histories of New Zealand firms. It uses both the traditional and the ?born-global? approaches as a framework to study the internationalization processes of the firms. The authors use the histories to conduct a systematic analysis of the extent to which firms that might be categorized as following a traditional or born-global internationalization path differ in the strategies they have used and in their prior motivations and capabilities. The main findings are that many attributes of the born-global model also characterize firms that began their internationalization along traditional lines but were radically transformed in the process of achieving global reach. This study identifies the consequences of rapid international growth, referred to as ?the gusher,? among these firms and the destabilizing effects of the experience as the firm is taken in unexpected directions. The authors conclude that the born-global model has much in common with the internationalization of small entrepreneurial firms and that its most distinctive elements lie in the model's relevance to an increasingly globalized world economy and in the more aggressive learning strategies that are required to follow this path.",0
Opportunity Discovery and Creation as a Duality: Evidence from Small Firms? Foreign Market Entries,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Little research addresses the likely enabling character of the discovery and creation of opportunities during the internationalization of small firms or how international opportunities are found and constructed during the process of foreign market entry (FME). This article therefore studies how opportunities become connected during small firms? FME. By incorporating the concept of duality, this article conceives of the discovery and creation of opportunity as mutually enabling rather than opposed. From this duality perspective, opportunity discovery and creation facilitate each other during internationalization processes. This case study involves five high-tech Australian firms and 30 FMEs. The findings show that knowledge, networks, and capabilities enable opportunities in the FME context. International opportunities are connected and nested in different levels of generality and specificity. The FME opportunities may be based on opportunity embeddedness, because each opportunity has implications for other opportunities. The findings lead to a model and propositions to explain the relationships between opportunity discovery and creation in FME.",0
The Effect of Word of Mouth on Sales: Online Book Reviews,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors examine the effect of consumer reviews on relative sales of books at Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. The authors find that (1) reviews are overwhelmingly positive at both sites, but there are more reviews and longer reviews at Amazon.com; (2) an improvement in a book's reviews leads to an increase in relative sales at that site; (3) for most samples in the study, the impact of one-star reviews is greater than the impact of five-star reviews; and (4) evidence from review-length data suggests that customers read review text rather than relying only on summary statistics.",1
Model of Brand Choice with a No-Purchase Option Calibrated to Scanner-Panel Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In usual practice, researchers specify and estimate brand-choice models from purchase data, ignoring observations in which category incidence does not occur (i.e., no-purchase observations). This practice can be problematic if there are unobservable factors that affect the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. When such a correlation exists, it is important to model simultaneously the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. The authors propose a model suitable for scanner-panel data in which the no-purchase decision depends on the price, feature, and display of each brand in the category and on household stock of inventory. They link the no-purchase model to the brand-choice outcome through marketing-mix covariates and through unobservables that affect both outcomes. The authors assume that model parameters are heterogeneous across households and allow for a flexible correlation structure between the coefficients in the no-purchase model and those in the brand-choice model. The model formulation is more general than what is possible from either a nested logit model or a translog utility model and from models in which the no-purchase outcome is an additional outcome with the deterministic component of its utility set equal to zero. The authors estimate the proposed model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. They then apply the estimation methods to scanner-panel data on the cola product category and compare the results with those from the widely used nested logit model.",1
Building Agent-Based Decision Support Systems for Word-of-Mouth Programs: A Freemium Application,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network?level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.",1
Investigating Category Pricing Behavior at a Retail Chain,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"In studying retailer pricing behavior, researchers typically assume that retailers maximize profits across all brands in a focal product category. In this article, the author attempts to study empirically the extent to which three factors affect retail prices: (1) the effects of payments from manufacturers to the retailer other than regular promotions, as well as the effects of additional costs borne by the retailer for these brands; (2) the retailer's objectives specific to its store brand, such as maximizing store brand share; and (3) the effects of retail competition and store traffic. By specifying a demand function at the brand-chain level for each brand in the product category, the author derives pricing rules for the retailer. The author decomposes the retail price of a brand into effects due to wholesale price, markup (obtained from the demand functions), additional promotional payments, retail competition, and the retailer's objectives for the store brand. The author carries out empirical analysis for a specific product category at a single retail grocery chain. The results indicate that the effects of the three factors vary across brands in the category.",1
Estimating a Stockkeeping-Unit-Level Brand Choice Model that Combines Household Panel Data and Store Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The marketing literature has addressed the issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity when estimating a choice model with household-level panel data. When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is difficult to control for item- and time period?specific unmeasured characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists. In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting the stores, the data contain the time period?specific item-level information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has some sales in each time period. Given the relative merits of household data to estimate the distribution of heterogeneity and store-level data to address the endogeneity problem, the authors propose an integrated estimation procedure that uses the information in both sources. They provide empirical results from their model using data on the fabric softener market. They extend their approach to situations in which there is variation in purchase quantities that households choose.",1
New Drug Diffusion when Forward-Looking Physicians Learn from Patient Feedback and Detailing,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors study physicians? prescription choices when uncertainty about drug efficacy is resolved through two channels: firms? marketing activities (e.g., detailing) and patients? experiences with the drugs. They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing. Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing increases in detailing activities.",1
Delight by Design: The Role of Hedonic versus Utilitarian Benefits,Journal of Marketing,2008,"What is the relationship between product design benefits (hedonic versus utilitarian) and the postconsumption feelings of customer delight and satisfaction? The primary insights this research provides are as follows: (1) Products that meet or exceed customers? utilitarian needs and fulfill prevention goals enhance customer satisfaction (e.g., a car with antilock brakes and vehicle stability assist), and (2) products that meet or exceed customers? hedonic wants and fulfill promotion goals enhance customer delight (e.g., a car with panoramic sunroof and six-speaker audio system). Furthermore, the research finds that the primary antecedent feelings of satisfaction are the prevention emotions of confidence and security provided by utilitarian benefits, whereas the primary antecedent feelings of delight are the promotion emotions of cheerfulness and excitement provided by hedonic benefits. Finally, the results show that delighting customers improves customer loyalty, as measured by word of mouth and repurchase intentions, more than merely satisfying them. The authors discuss the theoretical contribution and strategic insights the research provides for product designers and marketers.",0
Comparing Apples to Apples or Apples to Oranges: The Role of Mental Representation in Choice Difficulty,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Contrary to the general view that decision difficulty is a stable characteristic of specific choice sets, the authors propose that decision difficulty depends on how the choice set is mentally represented. Comparing the difficulty associated with comparable and noncomparable choice sets, the authors find that changes in mental representation can make the same choice feel more or less difficult. They propose that the representation level influences the type of decision criterion that becomes readily available; whether this available criterion is appropriate for comparing the options in turn affects choice difficulty. Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect of representation level on the difficulty of comparable and noncomparable choices and its downstream implications for decision satisfaction.",1
Preference Minorities and the Internet,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Offline retailers face trading area and shelf space constraints, so they offer products tailored to the needs of the majority. Consumers whose preferences are dissimilar to the majority??preference minorities??are underserved offline and should be more likely to shop online. The authors use sales data from Diapers.com, the leading U.S. online retailer for baby diapers, to show why geographic variation in preference minority status of target customers explains geographic variation in online sales. They find that, holding the absolute number of the target customers constant, online category sales are more than 50% higher in locations where customers suffer from preference isolation. Because customers in the preference minority face higher offline shopping costs, they are also less price sensitive. Niche brands, compared with popular brands, show even greater offline-to-online sales substitution. This greater sensitivity to preference isolation means that these brands in the tail of the long tail distribution draw a greater proportion of their total sales from high?preference minority regions. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for online retailing research and practice.",1
Doing Good in Another Neighborhood: Attributions of CSR Motives Depend on Corporate Nationality and Cultural Orientation,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"In the past few decades, consumers around the world have placed increasing value on corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a response, companies entering new markets have boosted spending in areas like cause-related marketing to improve their reputation and create goodwill among consumers in the host country. However, these efforts may not be effective for all consumers or in all countries. Drawing upon research on intergroup bias and attribution theory, the present work explores how consumers from individualistic (the United States and Canada) and collectivistic (South Korea and India) cultures form attributions and attitudes about the CSR activities of foreign and domestic firms. Across three studies, we find that collectivistic (but not individualistic) consumers make more altruistic (but not egoistic) attributions about the CSR motives of domestic (vs. foreign) companies, and that altruistic attribution leads to more positive attitudes toward the firm. We also showed that collectivists? bias against foreign firms is attenuated when level of commitment to the cause (as conveyed by CSR duration) is high.",0
Choice as an End versus a Means,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article investigates the consequence of the choice process for mental resources and the desire to obtain the selected products. The authors draw a distinction between instrumental choice, which serves preexisting consumption goals, and experiential choice, which serves as its own end. Across four studies, they find that instrumental choice undermines mental resources and experiential choice increases these resources. As a result, although experiential choice is made with no consumption goal in mind, compared with instrumental choice, it increases the desire to obtain the selected product. The authors demonstrate these effects on choice among a variety of consumer products (e.g., vacation packages, novels, flower bouquets).",1
Spatiotemporal Analysis of Imitation Behavior across New Buyers at an Online Grocery Retailer,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"For Internet retailers, demand propagation varies not only through time but also over space. The authors develop a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to study two imitation effects in the evolution of demand at an Internet retailer. Building on previous literature, the authors allow imitation behavior to be reflected both in geographic proximity and in demographic similarity. As these imitation effects can be time varying, the authors specify their dynamics using a ?polynomial smoother? embedded within the Bayesian framework. They apply the model to new buyers at Netgrocer. com and calibrate it on 45 months of data that span all 1459 zip codes in Pennsylvania. The authors find that the proximity effect is especially strong in the early phases of demand evolution, whereas the similarity effect becomes more important with time. Over time, new buyers are increasingly likely to emerge from new zip codes beyond the ?core set? of zip codes that produce the early new buyers, and spatial concentration declines. The authors explore the managerial implications stemming from these findings through a hypothetical ?seeding? experiment. They also discuss other implications for Internet retailing practice.",1
Can Brands Move in from the Outside? How Moral Identity Enhances Out-Group Brand Attitudes,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Consumers tend to have more favorable attitudes for their in-group brands than their out-group brands. However, little is known regarding how brand managers can overcome consumers? negative attitudes toward out-group brands. Drawing on the moral identity literature, the authors theorize that moral identity may enhance out-group (but not in-group) brand attitudes through decreased psychological distance. Four studies demonstrate that moral identity increases out-group brand attitudes. The authors also identify two important boundary conditions of this moral identity effect. These findings suggest that brand managers who want to overcome the less-than-favorable perceptions associated with out-group brands may benefit from drawing on consumers? moral identity in marketing communications. Theoretically, this research establishes that moral identity extends beyond prosocial behaviors to influence marketplace judgments (i.e., brand attitudes and categorization).",0
Retail Pricing Strategies in Recession Economies: The Case of Taiwan,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"In a recession economy, consumers tend to be more sensitive about price, and firms have difficulty obtaining necessary resources for effective pricing. However, previous studies into pricing appear to overlook the possible effect of economic environment on the effectiveness of a pricing strategy. By observing the current recession and the resultant price war in Asian countries, the authors examine marketing decisions by retailers in a recession economy. The authors propose a contingent model, based on organizational resources and consumer price consciousness, to guide the examination of the strategy?performance bond. The results show that only resource-abundant retailers are able to use strategies proposed in this study to thrive in a recession. A value-centric strategy outperforms all other approaches.",0
"Job Satisfaction, Job Performance, and Effort: A Reexamination Using Agency Theory",Journal of Marketing,2006,"The objective of this article is to clarify ambiguities in the literature regarding the relationships among three key constructs of work relationships: effort, job performance, and job satisfaction. The relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is of central interest to research in organizational psychology. However, empirical research in that area finds that the link between these constructs is weak at best. A negative effect of effort on job satisfaction is consistent with agency theory, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this assumption. Moreover, some studies have found a positive effect of effort on job satisfaction. Using a model that incorporates the main constructs from agency theory and organizational psychology, the current study finds a negative, direct effect of effort and a positive, direct effect of job performance on job satisfaction. The authors show that conflicting findings in the literature are the result of inconsistency in both the measurement and the definition of constructs across studies that do not fully account for all the relationships between constructs. The current findings emphasize the need to distinguish clearly between factors that represent employees' inputs in a work relationship (i.e., effort) and those that represent their outputs (i.e., job performance). The article also demonstrates the importance of properly accounting or controlling for all key variables to eliminate biases that can arise in empirical research on work relationships.",0
Competitive Pricing of Information: A Longitudinal Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers.",1
An Empirical Test of Warranty Theories in the U.S. Computer Server and Automobile Markets,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Four theories on the economic rationale for warranty provision have been proposed in the literature: (1) Warranties provide insurance to customers and work as a risk-sharing mechanism, (2) warranties are a sorting mechanism and work as a means for second-degree price discrimination among customers with different risk preferences, (3) warranties work as a signal of product quality to consumers under information asymmetry, and (4) warranties work as an incentive mechanism for firms to reveal and improve product quality. The authors examine the conditions under which each theory would apply and derive testable implications from the data. They then assess whether these theories have empirical support in the U.S. computer server and automobile markets in the context of manufacturer base warranties. The results indicate that in both markets, warranties primarily provide customers with insurance against product failure, and warranties of different durations work as a sorting mechanism across customers with different levels of risk aversion. Warranties are not used to signal product quality or to provide an incentive for manufacturers to reveal or improve product quality.",0
Assessing the Economic Value of Distribution Channels: An Application to the Personal Computer Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Evaluating proposed changes in channels of distribution and matching products to channels in multichannel product markets are difficult tasks for the management of any company. Such policy-oriented issues cannot be addressed easily by methods such as controlled experiments in test markets, which are feasible methods for evaluating pricing and advertising decisions, or by using historical sales/profits data. In this article, the authors show how the framework of structural modeling and policy simulations can be used to evaluate such policy changes. They also show how to assess the economic value of each channel to each firm and to its customers. They apply such policy simulations to the personal computer market, which is characterized by multiple firms competing through various channels using multiple products. The analysis quantifies the profit impact on firms and the welfare impact on consumers of many proposed channel actions and provides an economic rationale for different actions observed in this marketplace, such as decisions to add or drop marketing channels. The authors also simulate the effects of the Hewlett-Packard?Compaq merger but go beyond a standard merger analysis by evaluating the effects of various potential channel actions co-incident with the merger.",1
Leveraging Interfirm Relationships in China: Western Relational Governance or Guanxi? Domestic Versus Foreign Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"With the growing importance of strategic alliances and supply chains as competitive units, academics and practitioners are interested in understanding the techniques used by firms to leverage interfirm relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Studies conducted in the Western context underline the role of relational governance (i.e., the modern Western way), whereas works in the Chinese context highlight the importance of guanxi (i.e., the traditional Chinese way). Today?s Chinese economy operates as a hybrid of the Western modern business model and traditional Chinese patterns with the coexistence of Western relational governance and guanxi. Therefore, this study addresses two issues: (1) whether these two types of governance interact as substitutes or complements in leveraging interfirm relationships and (2) whether and how foreign firms differ from their Chinese domestic counterparts in the use of these two types of governance to improve performance. Drawing on data collected from 132 third-party logistics providers in China, this study shows that Western relational governance and guanxi function as substitutes in improving performance. Moreover, while guanxi contributes to performance in a similar manner in Chinese domestic firms and foreign firms, Western relational governance is more effective for foreign firms than for Chinese domestic firms. Furthermore, the joint role (i.e., interaction effect) of Western relational governance and guanxi in improving performance also differs: these two forms of governance function as substitutes in foreign firms, whereas they have no significant interaction in Chinese domestic firms.",0
Savoring an Upcoming Experience Affects Ongoing and Remembered Consumption Enjoyment,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Five studies, using diverse methodologies, distinct consumption experiences, and different manipulations, demonstrate the novel finding that savoring an upcoming consumption experience heightens enjoyment of the experience both as it unfolds in real time (ongoing enjoyment) and when it is remembered (remembered enjoyment). This theory predicts that the process of savoring an upcoming experience creates affective memory traces that are reactivated and integrated into the actual and remembered consumption experience. Consistent with this theorizing, factors that interfere with consumers? motivation, ability, or opportunity to form or retrieve affective memory traces of savoring an upcoming experience limit the effect of savoring on ongoing and remembered consumption enjoyment. Affective expectations, moods, imagery, and mindsets do not explain the observed findings.",0
Incentives versus Reciprocity: Insights from a Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"The authors conduct a field experiment in which they vary the sales force compensation scheme at an Asian enterprise that sells consumer durable goods. With variation generated by the experimental treatments, the authors model sales force performance to identify the effectiveness of various forms of conditional and unconditional compensation. They account for salesperson heterogeneity using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the model. They find conditional compensation in the form of quota bonus incentives to improve performance; however, such compensation may lead to lower future performance. The authors find little difference in effectiveness between a quota bonus plan and punitive bonus plans framed as a penalty for not achieving quota. They find that unconditional compensation, in the form of reciprocity, is effective at improving sales force performance only when it is given as a delayed reward; however, the effectiveness of this plan decreases with repeated exposure. The authors also find heterogeneity in the impact of compensation on performance across salespeople, such that unconditional compensation is more effective for salespeople with high base performance, whereas conditional compensation is equally effective across all types of salespeople.",1
International Standardization Strategies: The Experiences of Australian and New Zealand Firms Operating in the Greater China Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Drawing on the findings of previous theoretical and empirical studies, this study proposes two frameworks for examining standardization strategies in home?host and intermarket scenarios. For the first time, internal and external factors, extent of standardization, program and process, performance, and home?host/intermarket scenarios are included in one study. In its examination of the proposed research frameworks, the study relies on the experiences of 146 Australian and New Zealand firms operating in the Greater China markets. Factors identified as significantly related to the selection of standardized marketing strategies in the home?host scenario include product type, consumer behavior, marketing infrastructure, political environment, and firm size. Factors suggested by the multivariate regression analysis as significantly related to standardized strategies in the intermarket scenario are product type, international business experience, competitive environment, political and legal aspects, and firm size. For the first time, it is suggested that the standardization of distribution and product strategies has an effect on firm performance in the intermarket scenario.",0
"The Seesaw Self: Possessions, Identity (De)activation, and Task Performance",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Research has shown that possessions have the power to change consumers? self-construal and activate different aspects of the self. Building on this literature, the authors suggest that the salience of product ownership not only activates the product-related self but also simultaneously deactivates product-unrelated selves, resulting in impaired performance on tasks unrelated to the activated self. In five experiments, we first elicit feelings of ownership over a product (e.g., a calculator) to activate a product-related identity (e.g., the math self). Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do. Support for the underlying identity activation process comes from the finding that performance impairment is more likely to hold under conditions of low self-concept clarity, in which identity is malleable. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this finding.",1
A General Choice Model for Bundles with Multiple-Category Products: Application to Market Segmentation and Optimal Pricing for Bundles,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The attribute-based approach to study customer choices cannot deal with bundles of heterogeneous components, which are usually drawn from different product categories. The authors develop the comparability-based balance model, which is a unified framework for modeling bundle choices. The model can be employed for any bundle, regardless of the heterogeneity of bundle components, under a pure bundling strategy. The conjoint model and balance model are special cases of the general model. The authors use mixture distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in a more flexible manner than the extant approaches such as latent-class and random-coefficient models. The empirical tests of the model show that most attribute effects are significant and consistent with the model's predictions. The model is superior to those that do not consider the issues of comparability of attributes, latent-class structure, and heterogeneity among respondents. The authors show how the model can be used to find market segments for bundles with heterogeneous products in multiple product categories, to estimate individual reservation prices for bundles, and to determine the optimal bundle prices for different market segments.",1
A General Consumer Preference Model for Experience Products: Application to Internet Recommendation Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors present a general consumer preference model for experience products that overcomes the limitations of consumer choice models, especially when it is not easy to consider some qualitative attributes of a product or when there are too many attributes relative to the available amount of preference data, by capturing the effects of unobserved product attributes with the residuals of reference consumers for the same product. They decompose the deterministic component of product utility into two parts: that accounted for by observed attributes and that due to nonobserved attributes. The authors estimate the unobserved component by relating it to the corresponding residuals of virtual experts representing homogeneous groups of people who experienced the product earlier and evaluated it. Their methodology involves identifying such virtual experts and determining the relative importance they should be given in the estimation of the target person's residuals. Using Bayesian estimation methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation inference, the authors apply their approach to two types of consumer preference data: (1) online consumer ratings (stated preferences) data for Internet recommendation services and (2) offline consumer viewership (revealed preferences) data for movies. The results empirically show that this new approach outperforms several alternative collaborative filtering and attribute-based preference models with both in- and out-of-sample fits. The model is applicable to both Internet recommendation services and consumer choice studies.",1
This Logo Moves Me: Dynamic Imagery from Static Images,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors propose that static visuals can evoke a perception of movement (i.e., dynamic imagery) and thereby affect consumer engagement and attitudes. Focusing on brand logos as the static visual element, the authors measure the perceived movement evoked by the logo and demonstrate that the evoked dynamic imagery affects the level of consumer engagement with the brand logo. They measure consumer engagement through both self-report measures and eye-tracking technology and find that engagement affects consumer attitudes toward the brand. The authors also show that the perceived movement?engagement?attitude effect is moderated by the congruence between perceived movement and brand characteristics. These findings suggest that dynamic imagery is an important aspect of logo design, and if used carefully, it can enhance brand attitudes.",1
Advertising a Desired Change: When Process Simulation Fosters (vs. Hinders) Credibility and Persuasion,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Ads promising a desired change are ubiquitous in the marketplace. These ads typically include visuals of the starting and ending point of the promised change (?before/after? ads). ?Progression? ads, which include intermediate steps in addition to starting and ending points, are much rarer in the marketplace. Across several consumer domains, the authors show an ad-type effect: progression ads foster spontaneous simulation of the process through which the change will happen, which makes these ads more credible and, in turn, more persuasive than before/after ads (Studies 1?3). The authors also show that impairing process simulation and high skepticism moderate the ad-type effect (Studies 4?5). Finally, they show effect reversals: if consumers focus on achieving the desired results quickly, and it is possible to do so, progression ads and the associated process simulation backfire in terms of credibility and persuasion (Studies 6?7). These findings contribute to existing research by identifying conditions under which progression ads have beneficial or disadvantageous effects. These findings have managerial implications because they run counter to current marketing practices, which favor before/after over progression ads.",1
The New Product Portfolio Innovativeness?Stock Returns Relationship: The Role of Large Individual Investors? Culture,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The marketing?finance interface literature has investigated the direct link between innovativeness and stock returns. The authors extend this research by focusing on two open questions: How and under what conditions is innovativeness associated with stock returns? Answering these questions is important for managers who have to defend innovation investments to board members and time the introductions of new products. The authors investigate large individual investors and their national culture in the food and beverage industry. Combining multiple data sets, they first examine the relationship between innovativeness and large individual investors? stock holding decisions (i.e., to sell, hold onto, or buy a firm?s stocks). The results indicate that national culture moderates this relationship. At the firm level, the authors show that large investors? stock holding partially mediates the innovativeness?stock returns relationship and that the culture of a firm?s large investors moderates this mediated relationship. Thus, they unveil a special segment of investors, large individual investors, who influence the extent to which firms benefit from innovativeness in the stock market in the food and beverage industry.",0
Toward a Theory of International Services: Marketing Intangibles in a World of Nations,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"This article defines and describes international services from the marketing perspective. A classification of four types of international services is proposed, and a theoretical model of one of these (contact-based services) is developed. With a rich literature on the nature of services, marketing scholars are in a strong position to make valuable contributions to the ongoing debate concerning international services, which has until now been dominated by international economists and trade statisticians.",0
Executive Insights: The Harmonization of Product Country Marking Statutes?Strategic Implications for International Marketers,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"The country marking displayed by a product repeatedly has been found to affect consumer product evaluations. This study provides a detailed examination of the ?tests of transformation? statutes, which form the international basis for determination of country marking. Four major legal tests (name, character, and use; essence; value-added; and article of commerce) are presented, and practical examples are provided to illustrate their strategic uses. Finally, strategic guidelines are provided for global marketing strategists for obtaining appropriate country markings.",0
Rising from the Ashes: How Brands and Categories Can Overcome Product-Harm Crises,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Product-harm crises are omnipresent in today's marketplace. Such crises can cause major revenue and market-share losses, lead to costly product recalls, and destroy carefully nurtured brand equity. Moreover, some of these effects may spill over to nonaffected competitors in the category when they are perceived to be guilty by association. The extant literature lacks generalizable knowledge on the effectiveness of different marketing adjustments that managers often consider to mitigate the consequences of such events. To fill this gap, the authors use large household-scanner panels to analyze 60 fast-moving consumer good product crises that occurred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and resulted in the full recall of an entire variety. The authors assess the effects of postcrisis advertising and price adjustments on the change in consumers? brand share and category purchases. In addition, they consider the extent to which the effects are moderated by two key crisis characteristics: the extent of negative publicity surrounding the event and whether the affected brand had to publicly acknowledge blame. Using the empirical findings, the authors provide context-specific managerial recommendations on how to overcome a product-harm crisis.",0
"Cosmopolitanism, Consumer Ethnocentrism, and Materialism: An Eight-Country Study of Antecedents and Outcomes",Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Although there is a consensus that industries are globalizing, the notion that consumer attitudes and behaviors worldwide are likewise homogenizing remains disputed. Despite widespread discourse on this topic, there is a dearth of empirical investigations. This international research examines similarities and differences with respect to the nature of three consumer attitudinal dispositions: cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and materialism. The authors cross-culturally compare demographic antecedents with these dispositions, as well as behavioral outcomes. They test the validation of the construct measures and associated hypotheses using survey data drawn from consumers in eight countries and structural equation modeling techniques, including multigroup analysis. Empirical findings broadly support the cross-cultural applicability of the constructs, though the links to the various demographic antecedents vary considerably from sample to sample. The role of each construct on behavior also varies substantially across the range of product categories considered and across and between national groups.",0
Improving Consumer Mindset Metrics and Shareholder Value through Social Media: The Different Roles of Owned and Earned Media,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Although research has examined the social media?shareholder value link, the role of consumer mindset metrics in this relationship remains unexplored. To this end, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model and accessibility/diagnosticity perspective, the authors hypothesize varying effects of owned and earned social media (OSM and ESM) on brand awareness, purchase intent, and customer satisfaction and link these consumer mindset metrics to shareholder value (abnormal returns and idiosyncratic risk). Analyzing daily data for 45 brands in 21 sectors using vector autoregression models, they find that brand fan following improves all three mindset metrics. ESM engagement volume affects brand awareness and purchase intent but not customer satisfaction, while ESM positive and negative valence have the largest effects on customer satisfaction. OSM increases brand awareness and customer satisfaction but not purchase intent, highlighting a nonlinear effect of OSM. Interestingly, OSM is more likely to increase purchase intent for high involvement utilitarian brands and for brands with higher reputation, implying that running a socially responsible business lends more credibility to OSM. Finally, purchase intent and customer satisfaction positively affect shareholder value.",0
Dynamic Governance Matching in Solution Development,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Facing competitive and commoditization threats, many companies shift to solution offerings, albeit with mixed results. With a qualitative analysis of dyadic data (suppliers and customers), this article investigates an important, often overlooked reason for such mixed outcomes: the complex, dynamic role of governance matching. This study identifies a series of tensions arising from solution-specific exchange conditions and the matched governance mechanisms actors use to address them: temporary asset colocation, network closure, knowledge-based boundary objects, rights allocation agreements, and liaison champions. It also reveals the dynamic nature of governance matching. Solutions evolve in three phases?experimentation, integration, and evolution?in which single mechanisms have different functions (safeguarding and/or coordination), provide contingent and transient benefits, and can be used in combination to address complex tensions. This study also identifies two decision points, mutual commitment and balanced power, that separate the three phases; their outcomes help explain why certain solution efforts do not take off, others stall, and still others revert to mere spot exchanges. Beyond contributing to solutions literature, these findings provide actionable insights to marketing managers.",0
Drivers of International E-Tail Performance: The Complexities of Orientations and Resources,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Retail e-commerce (e-tail) continues to grow as an important channel of distribution in the global business environment. In this article, the authors present and test a conceptual model of the relationships among firm orientations, strategic resources, and international e-tail performance. Specifically, they investigate the ability of important e-tail firm resources?brand strength and supplier relations?to mediate the effects of market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and foreign market orientation on revenue growth and firm performance relative to objectives. Using survey responses from a cross-national sample of 174 marketing and e-commerce decision makers, the authors find support for the role of brand strength and supplier relations as mediators between market and foreign market orientations and firm performance. The study provides managerial insights into the types of orientations and resources that can help drive e-tail performance and contributions regarding the indirect effects of orientations on international marketing performance.",0
The Impact of Counterfeiting on Genuine-Item Consumers? Brand Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2009,"An often-overlooked constituent in the debate on counterfeiting is the consumer of the genuine article?a brand manager's primary constituent. These consumers are drawn to premium brands in part because of the exclusivity and connotation of prestige associated with them. These characteristics are also the reason such brands are attractive targets of counterfeiting. When premium brands are counterfeited, which in turn gives a variety of consumers access to them, how do consumers of the genuine items react to the erosion of exclusivity and prestige? An investigation involving premium brands in Thailand and India reveals that consumers of genuine items adopt one of three strategies when faced with the prospect of their favorite brands being counterfeited: flight (abandoning the brand), reclamation (elaborating the pioneering patronage of a brand), and abranding (disguising all brand cues). The author examines these strategies in detail, revealing how the potential loss of exclusivity and prestige can either drive genuine-item consumers away from the brand or impel them to make strong claims to their patronage.",0
EXPRESS: They?re Just Not that into You: How to Leverage Existing Consumer-Brand Relationships through Social Psychological Distance,Journal of Marketing,2020,"While prevailing marketing practice is to encourage ever stronger relationships between consumers and brands, such relationships are rare and many consumers are relationship-averse or content with the status quo. The authors examine how marketers can more effectively manage existing brand relationships by focusing on the psychological distance between consumers and brands in order to match close (distant) brands with concrete (abstract) language in marketing communications. Through such matching, marketers can create a beneficial mindset-congruency effect leading to more favorable evaluations and behavior, even for brands that are relatively distant to consumers. Study 1 demonstrates the basic mindset-congruency effect and Study 2 shows it is capable of affecting donation behaviors. Study 3 documents two brand-level factors (search versus experience goods, brand stereotypes) that moderate this effect in managerially relevant ways. Study 4 shows that activation of the mindset-congruency effect influences consumers to spend more, and that these behaviors are moderated by consumer category involvement. The authors conclude with marketing and theoretical implications.",0
Franchising versus Company-Run Operations: Modal Choice in the Global Hotel Sector,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Franchising is already an important component of global strategy in many service sectors such as hotels. This article asks, ?Given a choice between a company-run and a franchised operation, what factors will tip the strategic selection toward franchising, for a particular hotel property?? The modal choice is influenced by both the environment or conditions in the market in which the hotel property is located?as well as the characteristics and strategy of the global hotel firm that is to decide whether to franchise, or run the property themselves. The propensity to franchise is shown to reflect a mix of factors, including: level of development of the intended foreign market; the extent of globalization and international experience of the firm; and strategic factors such as the degree of investment in its global reservations system and brand, as well as the size of its overall operations.",0
A Longitudinal Analysis of Customer Satisfaction and Share of Wallet: Investigating the Moderating Effect of Customer Characteristics,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Customer loyalty is an important strategic objective for all managers. Research has investigated the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty in various contexts. However, these predominantly cross-sectional studies have focused on customer retention as the primary measure of loyalty. There has been little investigation into the impact on share of wallet. Using data from the Canadian banking industry, this research aims to (1) provide the first longitudinal examination of the impact of changes in customer satisfaction on changes in share of wallet and (2) determine the moderating effects of customer age, income, education, expertise, and length of relationship. Data from 4319 households using 12,249 observations over a five-year period indicate a positive relationship between changes in satisfaction and share of wallet. In particular, the initial satisfaction level and the conditional percentile of change in satisfaction significantly correspond to changes in share of wallet. Two variables, income and length of the relationship, negatively moderate this relationship. Other demographic and situational characteristics have no impact.",0
Marketing the Unfamiliar: The Role of Context and Item-Specific Information in Electronic Agent Recommendations,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Electronic agents have the capacity to help consumers discover new products and generate demand for unfamiliar products. This article explores how consumers respond to recommendations of unfamiliar products made by electronic agents. Two studies using simulated music shopping agents show that (1) additional recommendations of familiar products serve as a context in which unfamiliar recommendations are evaluated; (2) when the presentation of the recommendations makes unfamiliar and familiar products appear similar, evaluative assimilation results; and (3) when additional information about unfamiliar products is given, consumers discriminate them from the familiar products, which produces evaluative contrast. These results establish that information that leads to higher evaluations when context is absent can lead to contrast and lower evaluations in the presence of attractive contextual recommendations.",1
Strategic Marketing Planning for Radically New Products,Journal of Marketing,2000,"In this article, the author outlines an approach to marketing planning for radically new products, disruptive or discontinuous innovations that change the dimensionality of the consumer decision. The planning process begins with an extensive situation analysis. The factors identified in the situation analysis are woven into the economic webs surrounding the new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks that can be updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that changes in assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new product. The author illustrates this method using a historical case regarding the introduction of videotape recorders by Sony and JVC and a contemporary case of the introduction of electric vehicles. The author provides a complete, numerical example pertaining to a software development project in the Appendix.",0
Pleasure as a Substitute for Size: How Multisensory Imagery Can Make People Happier with Smaller Food Portions,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Research on overeating assumes that pleasure must be sacrificed for the sake of good health. Contrary to this view, the authors show that focusing on sensory pleasure can make people happier and willing to spend more for less food, a triple win for public health, consumers, and companies alike. In five experiments, the authors ask U.S. and French adults and children to imagine vividly the taste, smell, and texture of three hedonic foods before choosing a portion size of another hedonic food. Compared with a control condition, this ?multisensory imagery? intervention led hungry and nondieting people to choose smaller food portions, and they anticipated greater eating enjoyment and were willing to pay more for them. This occurred because multisensory imagery prompted participants to evaluate portions on the basis of expected sensory pleasure, which peaks with smaller portions, rather than hunger. In contrast, health-based interventions led people to choose a smaller portion than the one they expected to enjoy most?a hedonic cost for them and an economic cost for food marketers.",1
Do Suppliers Benefit from Collaborative Relationships with Large Retailers? An Empirical Investigation of Efficient Consumer Response Adoption,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Collaborative manufacturer?retailer relationships based on efficient consumer response (ECR) have become ubiquitous over the past decade. Yet academic studies of ECR adoption and its impact on marketing relationships are relatively scarce. Inspired by the relational view of competitive advantage, the authors empirically investigate whether the extent to which suppliers of a major retailer adopt ECR has a beneficial impact on their outcomes. The results demonstrate that whereas ECR adoption has a positive impact on supplier economic performance and capability development, it also generates greater perceptions of negative inequity on the part of the supplier. However, retailer capabilities and supplier trust moderate some of these main effects. The overall results are robust with respect to differences in supplier size as well as between branded and private-label suppliers.",0
Building Store Loyalty through Store Brands,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In this article, the authors study the role of a store brand in building store loyalty through a game theoretic analysis. In a market in which a segment of consumers is sensitive to product quality and consumers' brand choice in low-involvement packaged goods categories is characterized by inertia, the authors show that quality store brands can be an instrument for retailers to generate store differentiation, store loyalty, and store profitability, even when the store brand does not have a margin advantage over the national brand. In addition, this loyalty argument does not apply for the ?cheap and nasty? private label strategy. Such a private label policy, on the contrary, reinforces rather than reduces price competition among stores. Indeed, the quality of the store brand must be above a threshold level to create this opportunity. It also follows that quality store brands, when carried by competing retailers, can be an implicit coordination mechanism that enables all the retailers to become more profitable. Finally, a quality store brand policy is profitable only if a significant portion of shoppers buys the national brand. This surprising result establishes the complementary roles of store brands and national brands. The former create store differentiation and loyalty, whereas the latter enable the retailer to raise prices and increase store profitability. The authors provide empirical support for their thesis by using evidence from Europe and household-level scanner panel data from the United States and Canada.",1
Providers Versus Platforms: Marketing Communications in the Sharing Economy,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) business models have become increasingly prevalent in the marketplace. However, little is known about what factors influence consumer perceptions of purchases from firms using these models. The authors propose that features inherent to the P2P model lead consumers to perceive high provider?firm independence, where providers are viewed as relatively independent from the platform on which they offer goods/services. Across a series of studies, the authors show that when P2P brands use provider-focused (vs. platform-focused) marketing communications, consumers perceive a purchase as helping an individual provider to a greater extent, which increases consumers? willingness to pay and their likelihood of both making a purchase and downloading the brand?s app. This is because provider-focused marketing communications in this context lead consumers to think about their purchase from the provider?s perspective, thus adopting an ?empathy lens.? The authors further show that this effect does not extend to other business models. This work thus identifies provider- (vs. platform-) focused marketing communications as a way for marketing managers of P2P brands to drive important purchase-related outcomes.",0
Name-Letters and Birthday-Numbers: Implicit Egotism Effects in Pricing,Journal of Marketing,2014,"This research examines how the implicit egotism resulting from consumers? positive self-associations affects their evaluations of product prices. The effects can occur when the product's price and the consumer share either name-letters (name-letter/price effect) or birthday-numbers (birthday-number/price effect). Through a series of studies, the authors demonstrate that the positive affect linked to name-letters and birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers? price predilections and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. More specifically, consumers like prices (e.g., ?fifty-five dollars?) that contain digits beginning with the same first letter (e.g., ?F?) as their own name (e.g., ?Fred,? ?Mr. Frank?) more than prices that do not. Similarly, prices that contain cents digits (e.g., $49.15) that correspond to a consumer's date of birth (e.g., April 15) also enhance pricing liking and purchase intentions. Across groups of consumers, the authors? findings demonstrate that implicit egotism effects can result in greater purchase intentions for a higher-priced product compared with a lower-priced product.",0
Price Number Relationships and Deal Processing Fluency: The Effects of Approximation Sequences and Number Multiples,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"This research investigates how the relationships among pieces of numerical information in a price promotional offer (i.e., regular price, sale price, absolute discount, and relative discount) affect deal processing fluency. Across four studies (including a field study involving purchase data collected from an online group-buying website), the authors show that when the numbers constitute an approximation sequence or are multiples of one another, deal processing fluency is increased, which influences deal liking and ultimately has an impact on consumers? price promotion predilection. In addition, this article demonstrates that when consumers are not highly motivated to process numerical information, they may choose deals that offer less economic value but feature a combination of numbers that they can more fluently process. This research has important implications for the type of numerical information marketers should include in price promotional offers.",1
How Firms Relate to Their Markets: An Empirical Examination of Contemporary Marketing Practices,Journal of Marketing,2002,"The authors examine 308 firms in the United States and four other Western countries to understand how different types of firms relate to their markets. Comparative analysis shows that though there is some support for consumer and goods firms being more transactional and business and service firms being more relational, there are many exceptions. The results also show that firms can be grouped into those whose marketing practices are predominantly transactional, predominantly relational, or a transactional/relational hybrid. Each group constitutes approximately one-third of the sample and includes all types of firms (consumer goods, consumer services, business-to-business goods, and business-to-business services). This suggests that marketing practices are pluralistic and managerial practice has not shifted from transactional to relational approaches per se.",0
International Competitiveness: Empirical Findings from SME Service Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"This article extends Buckley, Pass, and Prescott (1988, 1990, 1992) by using case research to examine factors contributing to international competitiveness, in the context of SME software developers and engineering consultants. The results indicate that universal prescriptions of international competitiveness measures are inappropriate. Implications are drawn for research and practice.",0
Creating Major Innovations with Customers: Insights from Small and Young Technology Firms,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The marketing literature typically argues that customers cannot easily be involved with, and contribute to, the creation of major innovation (MI). This article finds otherwise. The authors use an inductive process method to study how six MIs were developed for business-to-business markets by small and young technology firms. Three of the MIs were successful, and three failed. The firms with MI success are distinguished by a nonconventional new product development process that includes five iterative and overlapping activities and up to ten different customer roles. These activities and roles are captured in a multifaceted taxonomy of customer participation. The analysis also uncovers three capabilities relevant to the development of successful MI?capabilities that are effectual rather than adaptive in nature. These findings and the propositions derived from them offer a more complete understanding of customer participation, new product development across contexts, and marketing capabilities.",0
Internationalization of Service SMEs: An Integrated Perspective from the Engineering Consulting Sector,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"Internationalization traditionally has been examined using a single theoretical framework in the context of large manufacturing firms. The authors argue that it is more relevant to examine foreign direct investment (FDI) theory (including transaction cost analysis), the stage models of internationalization, or network theory in an integrated and holistic manner. Using case studies of four New Zealand-based engineering consulting firms classified as small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the study identifies and analyzes patterns and influences related to the smaller service firm's decision to internationalize, subsequent internationalization, market selection, and mode of entry. The findings show that SME internationalization in the engineering consulting sector is a complex process, and concepts inherent in FDI theory, the stage models, and the network perspective are all evident. These results support the argument that service internationalization is too broad a concept to be defined exclusively or examined by any one theoretical framework. Implications are drawn for research and practice.",0
Consumer Response to Drug Risk Information: The Role of Positive Affect,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Risk disclosure is an essential element of the marketing of prescription drugs and other medical products. This study examines how consumers respond to verbal information about the frequency and severity of medical-product risks and how media-induced affect can moderate such responses. The study finds that consumers tend to overestimate the actual likelihood of adverse events described with words such as ?common? or ?rare? (compared with the probabilities such terms are typically intended to convey) and that consumers tend to give little weight to such probability language when forming product use intentions. However, consumers in positive media-induced moods seem to engage in more nuanced evaluation of product risk information, weighing both frequency and severity information and using such information to make inferences about other product attributes (e.g., product efficacy). These findings suggest that medical marketers and regulators need to devise more effective means of communicating risk probability to consumers and that positive mood induction (e.g., by placing advertisements in upbeat media environments) can enhance consumers? ability to process product risk information.",0
Understanding Consumer Responses to Product Risk Information,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Two experiments examine how message framing moderates consumer responses to product risk information. The findings suggest that contrary to an influential theory, consumers exposed to loss-framed messages exhibit a general aversion to product risk involving both short-term adverse effects and more permanent harm. In contrast, consumers exposed to gain-framed messages differentiate among different types of product risk. They essentially ignore temporary product risks but give considerable decisional weight to risks of permanent harm. This article discusses the implications of these findings for those who design and regulate promotional messages that contain product risk disclosures.",0
Communicating the Consequences of Early Detection: The Role of Evidence and Framing,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Despite the enormous benefits of early-detection products, consumers are reluctant to use them. The authors explore this reluctance, testing alternative approaches to communicating the consequences of detection behaviors. The results suggest that anecdotal messages are more involving than statistical messages and that positive anecdotes (about gains from screening) are less persuasive than negative anecdotes (about the losses from failing to get screened); positive anecdotes appear to cause a ?boomerang? effect. The authors discuss implications for promoting consumer risk-reduction behaviors.",0
Suspicious Minds: Exploring Neural Processes during Exposure to Deceptive Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"When viewing advertisements, consumers must decide what to believe and what is meant to deceive. Accordingly, much behavioral research has explored strategies and outcomes of how consumers process persuasive messages that vary in perceived sincerity. New neuroimaging methods enable researchers to augment this knowledge by exploring the cognitive mechanisms underlying such processing. The current study collects neuroimaging data while participants are exposed to advertisements with differing levels of perceived message deceptiveness (believable, moderately deceptive, and highly deceptive). The functional magnetic resonance imaging data, combined with an additional behavioral study, offer evidence of two noteworthy results. First, confirming multistage frameworks of persuasion, the authors observe two distinct stages of brain activity: (1) precuneus activation at earlier stages and (2) superior temporal sulcus and temporal-parietal junction activation at later stages. Second, the authors observe disproportionately greater brain activity associated with claims that are moderately deceptive than those that are either believable or highly deceptive. These results provoke new thinking about what types of claims garner consumer attention and which consumers may be particularly vulnerable to deceptive advertising.",1
Executive Insights: Managing the Transnational Value Chain?Strategies for Firms from Emerging Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"To compete successfully in world markets, firms from emerging market and newly industrialized economies need to develop strategies to participate more broadly in the transnational value chain. More specifically, they need to move beyond cost-oriented commodity approaches that rely on low-cost labor and other resources to value-creating strategies that capture a greater share of the transnational value chain. This article presents six generic strategies appropriate for emerging market firms: low cost commodity, component manufacturing, private label manufacturing, low-cost leader, first generation technology, and specialized niche. The advantages and limitations of each of these strategies are discussed, as well as general guidelines for extending the firm's participation in the transnational value chain.",0
Configural Advantage in Global Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage in global markets depends on the geographic scope and diversity of the firm's operations and their interlinkage, as well as on the extent of market integration and interdependence. The spatial configuration of the firm's assets, capabilities, and resources and the ability to manage and use these resources effectively are crucial elements of the firm's global strategy. The authors examine the nature of a firm's configural advantage in global markets in terms of its key components, capabilities, and management issues.",0
Culture Matters: Consumer Acceptance of U.S. Films in Foreign Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Culture matters for products with significant cultural content. The current study examines the impact of cultural context on the box office performance of U.S. films in foreign markets. The results indicate that films perform better in countries that are culturally closer to the United States and those that have a greater degree of Americanization. The authors draw implications for films and, more broadly, for products with cultural content.",0
Small High-Technology Firms and International High-Technology Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"In this qualitative investigation, the authors report on the overseas expansion processes of technologically oriented U.K. small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The findings provide further challenges to the incremental approach to internationalization; also, the authors put forward criticisms in relation to policymakers? current approach to categorizing internationalizing SMEs in the provision of trade assistance programs.",0
Cultural Competence and Cultural Compensatory Mechanisms in Binational Households,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although it is well-known that the U.S. population is increasingly culturally diverse, cultural diversity within U.S. households is less recognized. This study investigates the effects of cultural dynamics on decision roles and influence within the binational household. In particular, the authors study households in which one spouse is from the United States and the other is an immigrant. The analysis uses survey data and in-depth interviews. Cultural competence (i.e., knowledge of country of residence) as a source of expert power and as a form of cultural capital in family decision making emerge as overarching themes. The authors also find that one family member may engage in cultural compensatory mechanisms in consumption in response to the immigrant family member's sacrifices (i.e., moving to the United States). The authors close with a discussion of the implications for family decision-making theory, marketers, and society.",0
The Charity Beauty Premium: Satisfying Donors? ?Want? versus ?Should? Desires,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Despite widespread conviction that neediness should be a top priority for charitable giving, this research documents a ?charity beauty premium? in which donors often choose beautiful, but less needy, charity recipients instead. The authors propose that donors hold simultaneous yet incongruent preferences of wanting to support beautiful recipients (who tend to be judged as less needy), but believing they should support needy recipients. The authors also posit that preferences for beautiful recipients are most likely to emerge when decisions are intuitive, whereas preferences for needy recipients are most likely to emerge when decisions are deliberative. These propositions are tested in several ways. First, when a beautiful recipient is included in basic choice sets, this recipient becomes the most popular option and increases donor satisfaction. Second, heightening deliberation steers choices away from beautiful recipients and toward needier ones. Third, donors explicitly state that they ?want? to give to beautiful recipients but ?should? give to less beautiful, needier ones. Taken together, these findings reconcile and extend previous and sometimes conflicting results about beauty and generosity.",1
The Importance of Strategic Fit between Host?Home Country Similarity and Exploration Exploitation Strategies on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises? Performance: A Contingency Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"The impact of host?home country similarity on firm performance has long been debated in the international marketing literature with inconclusive, if not contradictory, findings. Taking a contingency perspective, this study proposes that a small or medium-sized enterprise's (SME's) global market performance depends on the strategic fit between its exploration and exploitation strategies and its host country choice. The results of a survey of chief executive officers and senior international marketing managers of SMEs in the United States show that the impact of host?home country similarity on SMEs? international performance is moderated by their choice of exploration and exploitation strategies. Specifically, host?home country similarity has a positive impact on an SME's international performance when the firm adopts an exploitation strategy. Conversely, host?home country similarity has a negative impact on an SME's international performance when it adopts an exploration strategy. Directly addressing the long-standing host?home country similarity debate in the international marketing literature, this study sheds additional light on the drivers for SMEs? internationalization success.",0
Portfolio Dynamics and Alliance Termination: The Contingent Role of Resource Dissimilarity,Journal of Marketing,2013,"This article takes a portfolio approach to examine how an alliance's propensity of termination is influenced by its resource relationships with other alliances of the firm. Whereas previous research has suggested that similar partner resources in a portfolio create redundancy and that dissimilar resources are beneficial, this study argues that redundancy may be necessary to ensure stable access to resources and that synergies from dissimilar resources may be difficult to realize. Thus, under some conditions, resource dissimilarity may be less supportive of, or even detrimental to, the continuity of an alliance. The author identifies several conditional factors that change the role of resource dissimilarity. While relational connectedness between the focal partner and other partners of the firm is found to strengthen the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity on alliance continuity, vertical connectedness of alliance activities, formation of substituting alliances by the focal partner, and market uncertainty weaken the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity. The findings reveal alliance termination factors beyond dyadic interactions and provide important implications for managing interdependencies within an alliance portfolio to enhance alliance stability.",0
The Influence of Competitive Intensity and Market Dynamism on Knowledge Management Capabilities of Multinational Corporation Subsidiaries,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"The authors use the environment?strategy?performance theoretical framework to examine the direct influence of the environmental market conditions of competitive intensity and market dynamism on knowledge management capabilities of multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries and resultant subsidiary performance. The results of a survey of the managers of Croatian subsidiaries of foreign MNCs indicate that though both competitive intensity and market dynamism individually influence knowledge management capabilities, when examined jointly, market dynamism is a more influential environmental market condition than competitive intensity. The authors also find a significant, positive relationship between a subsidiary's knowledge management capabilities and its performance. The findings indicate the importance of understanding local market conditions and developing proper strategic configurations for MNC subsidiaries.",0
Alliance Portfolio Resource Diversity and Firm Innovation,Journal of Marketing,2012,"As interfirm collaboration plays an increasingly important role in firm innovation, many firms are engaged in multiple partnerships, forming portfolios of alliances. Research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. This study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. The authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. They examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. The model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. This study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.",0
Executive Insights: Emerging Market Segments in a Transitional Economy: A Study of Urban Consumers in China,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"How to integrate the emerging consumer segments in transitional economies into multinational corporations? global marketing strategies presents a significant challenge. An analysis of China's urban consumers based on a 1997 national survey reveals several market segments that are distinctive in their demographics, psychographics, lifestyles, media usage, and consumption patterns. The findings suggest that multinational corporations need to adapt to the local market conditions in China and other transitional economies.",0
Order of Entry and Performance of Multinational Corporations in an Emerging Market: A Contingent Resource Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Drawing on the resource-based view, this study examines the contingency effects of industry- and firm-level variables on the first-mover advantages and effective follower strategies in an emerging-market context. Using hierarchical regressions, the authors analyze a large data set of foreign investors in China. Contingency models that include the interactions of entry order with the moderating variables have better fit of the data than the main-effect models. Industry growth and competition, firm size, entry mode, resource commitment, and marketing intensity have significant moderating effects on first-mover advantages. After the authors correct for multicollinearity bias using ridge regression, it seems that pioneers still enjoy a small advantage in market share but not in profitability, indicating a trade-off between the two. Furthermore, followers may augment performance by increasing resource commitment and marketing intensity. These findings have significant implications for entry-order strategies and for improving foreign direct investment performance in foreign markets; they also suggest meaningful directions for further research.",0
Informational Challenges in Omnichannel Marketing: Remedies and Future Research,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Omnichannel marketing is often viewed as the panacea for one-to-one marketing, but this strategic path is mired with obstacles. This article investigates three challenges in realizing the full potential of omnichannel marketing: (1) data access and integration, (2) marketing attribution, and (3) consumer privacy protection. While these challenges predate omnichannel marketing, they are exacerbated in a digital omnichannel environment. This article argues that advances in machine learning and blockchain offer some promising solutions. In turn, these technologies present new challenges and opportunities for firms, which warrant further academic research. The authors identify both recent developments in practice and promising avenues for future research.",0
Fairness Ideals in Distribution Channels,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors analytically and experimentally evaluate how firms make decisions in a two-stage dyadic channel, in which firms decide on investments in the first stage and then on prices in the second stage. They find that firms? behavior differs significantly from the predictions of the standard economic model and is consistent with the existence of fairness concerns. Using a quantal response equilibrium model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players? decisions, or by the exogenous game structure. To do so, the authors compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal, which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players, significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel members have fairly different payoffs.",1
The Growth of Private Label Brands: A Worldwide Phenomenon?,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"In many countries, the growth of private label brands (PLBs) is negatively affecting manufacturer brands? shares, though PLBs have yet to take hold in other markets. Numerous studies have identified factors leading to the success of PLBs in product categories, and yet little empirical research has investigated the factors underlying the variability of PLB shares across countries. This research examines country-level market structure factors?retail distribution structure, retailer typology, and logistic structure?to understand the differential success of PLBs across countries. The results indicate that these factors help explain the dispersion pattern of PLB penetration across 46 countries and that the distribution structure has the largest effect on PLB share, followed by the logistic structure and retailer typology in particular global discounters. The findings can enable manufacturer brand managers to better foresee whether specific countries represent fertile ground for internationalizing their brands or, contrarily, constitute bastions for brand manufacturers to protect their brands? shares. The results also provide insights about the time frame over which PLB share development may pose a threat in different markets.",0
Educator Insights: Early Development of Collegiate Education in International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,1997,This article sheds light on some of the early roots of international marketing thought; it describes some of the earliest university courses offered in international marketing in North America. It presents evidence that international marketing was the subject of academic endeavor early in the twentieth century. It compares and contrasts topics covered in the earliest courses with those used in modern programs of study.,0
You get what you Pay for: The Effect of Top Executives? Compensation on Advertising and R&D Spending Decisions and Stock Market Return,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Although there is literature on how top executives? compensation influences general management decisions, relatively little is known about whether and how compensation influences advertising and research-and-development (R&D) spending decisions. This study addresses two questions. First, is there an incentive effect of long- versus short-term compensation on advertising and R&D spending? Second, is there a mediation effect of advertising and R&D spending on the relationship between long- versus short-term compensation and stock market return? The authors address these questions using a combination of ExecuComp, Compustat, and Center for Research in Security Prices data on 842 firms during the 1993?2005 period. They find that an increase in the equity to bonus compensation ratio is positively associated with an increase in advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales. Advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales also mediates the effect of equity to bonus ratio on stock market return. The authors discuss implications for top management seeking to mitigate myopic management of resources by employing compensation to incentivize a longer-term orientation for advertising and R&D spending to improve stock return.",0
Putting Brands in Their Place: How a Lack of Control Keeps Brands Contained,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"New brand extensions can push a brand outside its typical boundaries. In this article, the authors argue that people's acceptance of such extensions depends on their feelings of control. Across several studies, the authors demonstrate that when feelings of personal control are low, consumers and managers seek greater structure in brands and thus reject brand extensions that do not seem to fit well with the parent brand. The authors also identify important boundary conditions that illustrate when consumers are most likely to punish a brand for poor-fitting brand extensions and how the effect can be mitigated.",1
Executive Insights: A National Export Assistance Policy for New and Growing Businesses,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"This article is based on a speech delivered by the author to the National Economic Council in Washington, D.C. The White House-based council is charged with strengthening the competitive performance of U.S. firms. The author highlights the need for clarity of purpose, tightness of focus, coordination of approaches, emphasis on strengths, targeting of crucial factors, and boldness of vision in shaping a new export assistance policy.",0
Executive Insights: The World Trade Organization?Perspectives and Prospects,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article is based on a presentation made by the author to the staff of the International Trade Centre and the GATT in Geneva in the summer of 1994. It highlights the similarities between the International Trade Organization (ITO) which was proposed in 1948 and subsequently rejected, and the newly proposed World Trade Organization (WTO). A changed world environment is seen as favorable to the WTO. However, caution is expressed against overloading the WTO with issues and causes not germane to trade and investment.",0
Russia's Transition to a Market Economy: Learning about Business,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Russia's business leaders and employees find themselves in a new environment of competition, efficiency, and innovation, without the training and skills to adjust to these new realities. A field study investigated the business education needs in Russia. Four focus group sessions were conducted and interviews were held with 68 individuals.Distinct attitudes held by Russians toward business learning were national pride, anger with the seeming disrespect of outsiders for indigenous accomplishments, and a fear of the unknown, coupled with suspicion toward new practices. There was concern about the lack of relevance of the education offered, and about the linkage between knowledge, learning, and actual change, and the longevity of such change.A rank order of business education priorities identified issues requiring learning and areas in need of behavioral change. Marketing, strategic planning, international business, and business law were the four key learning issues while problem solving, decision making, customer orientation, team building and communications abilities were rated highest in terms of the need for behavioral change.Overall, many similarities between Russian and Western managers were found. However, Russian managers approach problems in a different fashion, need to be taught in different ways, and have different expectations of learning content. In order to be accepted and useful, business education efforts must consider the specifics of the Russian situation and focus both on the teaching of knowledge and skills as well as on the change of attitudes and behavior.",0
Educator Insights: The Policy Gap in International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"In the light of the growing importance of policy for international marketing practice, the author makes a case for an increase in policy-oriented international marketing work in academia by presenting some key policy issues and developing international marketing research dimensions associated with these issues. The author makes suggestions for the structuring of research strategies that are responsive to policy changes and offers some thoughts on how researchers can influence and shape policy with their research insights. The author makes recommendations that might help increase the policy orientation of international marketing academics.",0
An International Marketing Manifesto,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"In spite of important global inroads and successes scored by international marketing, the field stagnates in the eyes of academics, practitioners, and policymakers and is harshly attacked by activists. The people defending international marketing usually point to vague theoretical and long-term goals, whereas opponents serve up facile polemics, which acquire sympathies from the uninformed public. The authors postulate that the field of international marketing has already and can continue to make major contributions to the improvement of society. They offer seven theses in support of a lively debate for the sake of a renaissance of the field: (1) remember the roots and purpose of the field, (2) resist the temptations of overspecialization, (3) work with a new paradigm and new methods, (4) look to the world, (5) maintain the dialogue with all possible constituents, (6) work also with those who place or show, and (7) profess expertise.",0
Comparing the Effect of Store Remodeling on New and Existing Customers,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although retailers invest millions of dollars in redesigning, refreshing, and remodeling their stores, it is unclear that such large investments are worthwhile. Prior research has indicated that remodeling has only a short-term effect. However, a previously unexplored area is its effect on those who visit the store for the first time after it is remodeled (new customers) versus those who had visited before the remodeling (existing customers). This study contrasts the effect of store remodeling on new and existing customers in two field experiments with stores that underwent a major remodeling. Treatment and control stores are used in both experiments. The authors measure sales before and after the remodeling for new and existing customers; in one store, they also measure customers? psychological responses. In both cases, sales increased after the remodeling effort. However, sales for new customers are significantly higher than sales for existing customers after the remodel, and this difference persists for a year. Higher sales to new customers are primarily due to more new customers being drawn to the remodeled store, their higher spend per visit, and their subsequent increased visit frequency.",0
Egocentric Improvement Evaluations: Change in the Self as an Anchor for Brand Improvement Judgments,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Prior research has identified product improvement perceptions as critical to consumers? product upgrade decisions (e.g., upgrading to a new iPhone), but little work has examined factors influencing these improvement perceptions. This research shows that drawing consumers? attention to their global self-improvement can increase product improvement judgments and upgrade intentions when self?brand connection is high, a phenomenon the authors refer to as egocentric improvement evaluation. In line with egocentric categorization theory, which identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect. Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement motives. The core effect is moderated by self-affirmation, which quells the need for self-enhancement, and by self-threat, which heightens the need for self-enhancement. The authors investigate this effect in five studies and discuss the theoretical and practical implications.",1
Securities Trading of Concepts (STOC),Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Identifying winning new product concepts can be a challenging process that requires insight into private consumer preferences. To measure consumer preferences for new product concepts, the authors apply a ?securities trading of concepts,? or STOC, approach, in which new product concepts are traded as financial securities. The authors apply this method because market prices are known to efficiently collect and aggregate private information regarding the economic value of goods, services, and firms, particularly when trading financial securities. This research compares the STOC approach against stated-choice, conjoint, constant-sum, and longitudinal revealed-preference data. The authors also place STOC in the context of previous research on prediction markets and experimental economics. Across multiple product categories, the authors test whether STOC (1) is more cost efficient than other methods, (2) passes validity tests, (3) measures expectations of others, and (4) reveals individual preferences, not just those of the crowd. The results show that traders exhibit a self-preference bias when trading. Ultimately, STOC offers two key advantages over traditional market research methods: cost efficiency and scalability. For new product development teams deciding how to invest resources, this scalability may be especially important in the Web 2.0 world.",1
Thinking inside the Box: Why Consumers Enjoy Constrained Creative Experiences,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"From cooking kits to home improvement shows, consumers are increasingly seeking out products that are designed to help them be creative. In this research, the authors examine why consumers participate in creative activities and under what conditions these experiences are the most enjoyable. A qualitative study explores the diverse motivations for undertaking creative tasks and identifies the role of constraints in such endeavors. Then, the authors conduct two experimental studies to understand the importance of constraints (e.g., instructional guidance, target outcomes) in facilitating a balance between perceived competence and autonomy for consumers involved in a creative task. When consumers engage in creative activities with a sense of both autonomy and competence, they enjoy the experience more. The authors discuss implications for managers and provide opportunities for further research.",1
The Influence and Value of Analogical Thinking during New Product Ideation,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Although both the academic and the trade literature have widely acknowledged the need to foster the development of more-innovative products, little empirical research has examined the cognitive processes underlying the creation of these novel product concepts. In this research, three empirical studies examine how analogical thinking influences the idea-generation stage of the new product development process. The first study uses the verbal protocols of real-world industrial designers to trace the role of analogy in the context of a new product development task, and the second and third studies use an experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions. Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes. In addition, these studies reveal a positive relationship between the originality of the product concept and consumers' willingness to pay for it, an important measure in the concept-testing phase of product development.",1
Multidyadic Industrial Channels: Understanding Component Supplier Profits and Original Equipment Manufacturer Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Industrial component suppliers (CSs) work to enhance profitability by building brand differentiation with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and indirect industrial buyers (IIBs) through their marketing investments to each member. However, as a CS increases its marketing investments to its IIB, the OEM's profit position is threatened, motivating the OEM to respond with aligning or opposing behavior. The results from a three-study, multimethod design indicate that a CS's strategy of allocating its marketing investments between its OEM and IIB increases its brand differentiation, which allows it to capture increased profits subject to conditions of uncertainty. However, the results also demonstrate that the OEM does not sit idly by as its CS invests in building brand differentiation with the IIB; rather, it reacts with both aligning and opposing behaviors to benefit from the CS's investments as well as offset the CS's gains.",0
Prosocial Goal Pursuit in Crowdfunding: Evidence from Kickstarter,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In reward-based crowdfunding, creators of entrepreneurial projects solicit capital from potential consumers to reach a funding goal and offer future products/services in return. The authors examine consumers? contribution patterns using a novel data set of 28,591 projects collected at 30-minute resolution from Kickstarter. Extending prior research that assumes that economic considerations (e.g., project quality, campaign success likelihood) drive backers? decisions, the authors provide the cleanest field evidence so far that consumers also have prosocial motives to help creators reach their funding goals. They find that projects collect funding faster right before (vs. right after) meeting their funding goals because consumers not only are more likely to fund projects but also contribute greater amounts of money prior to goal attainment. This effect is amplified when the nature of a project tends to evoke consumers? prosocial motivation and when a project?s creator is a single person. These results suggest that consumers? prosocial motives not only play a role in reward-based crowdfunding but also can outweigh the opposing effects of economic factors including rational herding and certainty about campaign success.",1
Wish versus Worry: Ownership Effects on Motivated Judgment,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"How do consumers? needs and motivations influence their perceptions of external objects? For example, do hungry people perceive a cake to be larger or smaller than do satiated people? According to the New Look psychology literature, the answer is invariably ?larger.? However, in this article, the authors demonstrate that the answer is more complex depending on whether the object belongs to the perceiver. If the cake does not belong to the perceiver, she will perceive it to be larger if she is hungry than if she is satiated. In contrast, if the cake already belongs to her, she will perceive it to be smaller if she is hungry than if she is satiated. The authors propose a two-process (wishful thinking vs. worryful thinking) hypothesis to explain the finding and discuss its theoretical and marketing implications.",1
Educator Insights: International Marketing Blunders Revisited?Some Lessons for Managers,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"International marketing blunders represent avoidable mistakes made by companies in foreign markets. While there exists a well-developed literature of blunders committed abroad by firms from the United States, very few such tales have been reported from other countries. This article is a collection of new cases, compiled from a variety of sources and featuring numerous companies operating in various parts of the world. A framework for analyzing international marketing blunders is offered, along with managerial implications.",0
Homogeneous Contracts for Heterogeneous Agents: Aligning Sales Force Composition and Compensation,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Observed contracts in the real world are often very simple, which partly reflects the constraints faced by contracting firms in making the contracts more complex. In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a ?contractual externality? in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.",1
?There Ain?t No Such Thing as a Free Lunch?: Consumers? Reactions to Pseudo-Free Offers,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors examine how consumers respond to pseudo-free offers?offers that are presented to consumers as free but that require consumers to make a nonmonetary payment (such as completing a survey or providing personal information) in order to receive the ?free? good or service. Across six studies, the authors find that consumers are generally just as likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) as comparable truly free offers (with no costs), as long as the costs of the pseudo-free offers are below some threshold. Additionally, they find that consumers are significantly more likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) than comparable nonfree offers (with monetary costs). The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free offers as fair. However, when contextual influences, characteristics of the pseudo-free offer, or individual dispositions increase the likelihood of negative attributions, consumers? preference for pseudo-free offers is attenuated.",1
The Effect of Competitive Advertising Interference on Sales for Packaged Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Competitive advertising interference can occur when viewers of advertising for a focal brand are also exposed to advertising messages for competing brands within a short period (e.g., one week for television advertising). Although competitive advertising interference has been shown to reduce advertising recall and recognition and brand evaluation measures, no studies have examined its impact on brand sales. In this research, the authors use a market response model of sales for two grocery categories for a large grocery chain in the Chicago area to study the extent to which competitive advertising interference influences sales. The model enables the authors to capture the ?pure? own-brand advertising elasticities that would arise if there were no competitive interference. The results show that competitive interference effects on sales are strong. When one or more competing brands advertise in the same week as the focal brand, the advertising elasticity diminishes for the focal brand. The decrease depends on the number of competing brands advertising in a particular week and their total advertising volume. The authors find that having one more competitor advertise is often more harmful to a focal brand's advertising effectiveness than if the current number of advertising brands increase their total advertising volume.",1
Comparing the Relative Effectiveness of Advertising Channels: A Case Study of a Multimedia Blitz Campaign,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"In this study, the authors develop an inexpensive method to help firms assess the relative effectiveness of multiple advertising media. Specifically, they use a firm's loyalty program database to capture media exposure, through an online media survey, for all the media in which the firm advertises. In turn, the exposure data are matched with the purchase history for these same respondents, thereby creating single-source data. The authors illustrate their method for a large retailer that undertook a short-term promotional sale by advertising in television, radio, newspaper, magazine, online display ad, sponsored search, social media, catalog, direct mail, and e-mail channels. In this case, seven of the ten media significantly influence purchase outcomes. Finally, the authors demonstrate how to use their advertising response model to determine the optimal budget allocation across each advertising media channel.",1
Advertising Effectiveness for Multiple Retailer-Brands in a Multimedia and Multichannel Environment,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"An important aspect of multimedia advertising effectiveness that remains unexplored is a customer-level analysis of the relative importance of each medium for multiple retailer-brands within a product category. The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million) and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers. They segment customers by retailer-brand and channel usage, revealing a sizeable group of customers who shop across multiple retailer-brands and both purchase channels. Moreover, this segment is the most responsive to multimedia advertising.",1
Marketing-Mix Variables and the Diffusion of Successive Generations of a Technological Innovation,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Research addressing the diffusion of successive generations of technological innovations has generally ignored the impact of marketing-mix variables. As a result, there have been several calls for the development of multiple-generation models that incorporate marketing-mix variables. The authors develop a model of first-time sales and subscriptions for successive generations of a technological innovation, which explicitly captures the effects of marketing-mix variables through a proportional hazards framework. The empirical analysis estimates the impact of price for two generations of cellular telephones in a European country. The results suggest that there are important substantive insights to be gained from the parameter estimates for this marketing-mix variable when intergenerational interdependencies are considered. For example, although the time path of the estimated price elasticities in a multiple-generation setting closely follows those reported previously for single generations, the authors find evidence of an important interaction in price response across generations. Therefore, empirical estimates in single-generation models may be missing an important part of the pricing equation.",1
Optimizing Television Program Schedules Using Choice Modeling,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors examine the rescheduling of television programs to maximize the total ratings for one network across a week. The key idea is to design a choice experiment in which television programs are rescheduled and presented to respondents. Respondents read these program schedules (much like the regular TV Guide listings) and give their preferences, including not watching any of the listed programs. Because there are potentially billions of possible schedules, the authors give a procedure for designing a fractional factorial experiment that can accommodate both programs of varying length and constraints on eligible program times. The authors also develop a latent class multinomial logit model for modeling program preferences and present a validation of our experimental procedure and the model. They also present an empirical test of the procedure in which they use the model to predict ratings for all the possible program schedules, not just those constituting the choice sets. In this example, the optimum schedule increases the predicted total weekly ratings during prime time by 18% for a network. The projected increase in total weekly ratings is achieved without the network needing to purchase any new programs; all it needs to do is reschedule eight programs in its existing prime-time lineup.",1
Factors Affecting Web Site Visit Duration: A Cross-Domain Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this study, the authors examine factors that affect Web site visit duration, including user demographics, text and graphics content, type of site, presence of functionality features, advertising content, and the number of previous visits. The authors use a random effects model to determine the impact of these factors on site duration and the number of pages viewed. The proposed method accounts for three distinct sources of heterogeneity that arise from differences among people, Web sites, and visit occasions to the same Web site by the same person. The model is fit using one month of user-centric panel data, and it encompasses the 50 most popular sites in a market. The results show that, in general, older people and women visit Web sites for a longer period. Some surprising results are revealed in an examination of interactions between these demographic and site characteristic variables. For example, sites with higher levels of advertising usually result in lower visit duration, but this is not the case for older people. The model also yields insights into the relative importance of different sources of heterogeneity in visit duration; heterogeneity in visit occasions dominates over individual-level and Web site-specific heterogeneity.",1
"Where, When, and how Long: Factors that Influence the Redemption of Mobile Phone Coupons",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The use of coupons delivered by mobile phone, so-called ?m-coupons,? is growing rapidly. In this study, the authors analyze consumer response to m-coupons for a two-year trial at a large shopping mall. Approximately 8,500 people were recruited to a panel and received three text-message m-coupons whenever they ?swiped? their mobile phone at the mall entrances, with downstream redemption recorded. Almost 144,000 m-coupons were delivered during the trial, representing 38 stores that supplied 134 different coupons. The authors find that an important feature of m-coupons is where and when they are delivered, with location and time of delivery significantly influencing redemption. How long the m-coupons are valid (expiry length) is also important because redemption times for m-coupons are much shorter than for traditional coupons. This finding suggests that their expiration length should be shortened to help signal time urgency. Nevertheless, traditional coupon features, such as face value, still dominate m-coupon effectiveness, as does the product type, with snack food coupons being particularly effective.",1
Delusion in Attribution: Caveats in Using Attribution for Multimedia Budget Allocation,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Media attribution is the assignment of a percentage weight to each media touchpoint a consumer is exposed to prior to purchasing. Many firms consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate. An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition. Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase, taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels. By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based allocation.",1
Damage from Corrective Advertising: Causes and Cures,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Corrective advertising can be problematic because it undermines responses both to other products advertised by the corrected firm and to products advertised by second-party advertisers. However, a positive reputation insulates second-party firms from these carryover effects, provided that this reputation is based on an endorsement from an independent regulator. Furthermore, firm responses that include an explanation for the misleading claim prove to be effective in avoiding the negative side effects of correction. These findings add to the correction literature by (1) showing that this form of regulation can have much broader side effects than demonstrated previously, (2) identifying distrust as the mechanism by which these effects occur, and (3) suggesting strategies to protect firms from the negative side effects of correction. The findings also support the defensive consumer distrust model and help define the scope of this model.",0
"The Defensive Consumer: Advertising Deception, Defensive Processing, and Distrust",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors show that deceptive advertising engenders distrust, which negatively affects people's responses to subsequent advertising from both the same source and second-party sources. This negative bias operates through a process of defensive stereotyping, in which the initial deception induces negative beliefs about advertising and marketing in general, thus undermining the credibility of further advertising.",1
To Lease or to Buy? A Structural Model of a Consumer's Vehicle and Contract Choice Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"By treating leasing and financing contracts as differentiated products with their own unique acquisition costs, the authors develop a structural model of a consumer's choice of automobile and the related decision of whether to lease or buy it. They estimate the model on a data set of new car purchases from the entry-luxury segment of the U.S. automobile market. A key finding is that consumers are myopic and prefer contracts with lower payment streams even when they have higher total costs. The authors also find that consumers are more likely to lease than to finance cars with higher maintenance costs because this provides them with the option to return the car before maintenance costs become too high. The authors demonstrate how automobile manufacturers can use the model to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional incentives, such as cash rebates, interest rate subsidies, and increased residual values.",1
How Well Does Consumer-Based Brand Equity Align with Sales-Based Brand Equity and Marketing-Mix Response?,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Brand equity is the differential preference and response to marketing effort that a product obtains because of its brand identification. Brand equity can be measured using either consumer perceptions or sales. Consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) measures what consumers think and feel about the brand, whereas sales-based brand equity (SBBE) is the brand intercept in a choice or market share model. This article studies the extent to which CBBE manifests itself in SBBE and marketing-mix response using ten years of IRI scanner and Brand Asset Valuator data for 290 brands spanning 25 packaged good categories. The authors uncover a fairly strong positive association of SBBE with three dimensions of CBBE?relevance, esteem, and knowledge?but a slight negative correspondence with the fourth dimension, energized differentiation. They also reveal new insights on the category characteristics that moderate the CBBE?SBBE relationship and document a more nuanced association of the CBBE dimensions with response to the major marketing-mix variables than heretofore assumed. The authors discuss implications for academic researchers who predict and test the impact of brand equity, for market researchers who measure it, and for marketers who want to translate their brand equity into marketplace success.",0
The Challenge of Retaining Customers Acquired with Free Trials,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Many service firms acquire customers by offering free-trial promotions. However, a crucial challenge is to retain the customers acquired with these free trials. To address this challenge, firms need to understand how free-trial customers differ from regular customers in terms of their decisions to retain the service. This article conceptualizes how marketing communication and usage behavior drive customers? retention decisions and develops hypotheses about the impact of free-trial acquisition on this process. To test the hypotheses, the authors model a customer's retention and usage decisions, distinguishing usage of a flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service. The model allows for unobserved heterogeneity and corrects for selection effects and endogeneity. Using household panel data from a digital television service, the authors find systematic behavioral differences that cause the average customer lifetime value of free-trial customers to be 59% lower than that of regular customers. However, free-trial customers are more responsive to marketing communication and usage rates, which offers opportunities to target marketing efforts and enhance retention rates, customer lifetime value, and customer equity.",1
Genetic Data: Potential Uses and Misuses in Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Advances in molecular genetics have led to the exponential growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing industry, resulting in the assembly of massive privately owned genetic databases. This article explores the potential impact of this new data type on the field of marketing. Drawing on findings from behavioral genetic research, the authors propose a framework that incorporates genetic influences into existing consumer behavior theory and use it to survey potential marketing uses of genetic data. Applications include business strategies that rely on genetic variants as bases for segmentation and targeting, creative uses that develop consumers? sense of community and personalization, use of genetically informed study designs to test causal relations, and refinement of consumer theory by uncovering biological mechanisms underlying behavior. The authors further evaluate ethical challenges related to autonomy, privacy, misinformation, and discrimination that are unique to the use of genetic data and are not sufficiently addressed by current regulations. They conclude by proposing an agenda for future research.",0
How Evaluations of Multiple Percentage Price Changes Are Influenced by Presentation Mode and Percentage Ordering: The Role of Anchoring and Surprise,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"To advance theory, this study details how consumers evaluate multiple percentage price changes (discounts or surcharges). If they consider two discounts?for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an additional 12% off?consumers weight the two percentages to make their evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments. In addition to the underlying theory for these effects, this article delineates some boundary conditions and reveals the effects on consumers? evaluations and choices, with findings from 11 studies.",1
How Product Category Shapes Preferences toward Global and Local Brands: A Schema Theory Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"In contrast to the abundance of research on brand- and consumer-related determinants of global/local brand preference, little is known about whether and how the product category affects consumer choices between local and global brands. Drawing from schema theory, the authors (1) argue that consumers rely on their product category schemata to form perceptions of global versus local brand superiority, (2) introduce a compact scale to measure these perceptions, and (3) identify the key antecedents and consequences of these perceptions. Two studies in developed and emerging markets empirically support the hypotheses across multiple product categories, for both real and fictitious brands. The results indicate that consumers perceive global brands as superior to local brands in product categories with strong functional character and extensive symbolic capacity. Moreover, brands congruent with category superiority perceptions are preferred because of their justifiability, while brands that deviate from these perceptions are avoided because of their proneness to normative criticism. The findings imply that global/local brand preference is largely formed at the product category level and advocate for the use of category-specific strategies in global/local brand management.",0
?Should have I Bought the other One?? Experiencing Regret in Global versus Local Brand Purchase Decisions,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"This research addresses the unexplored postpurchase dynamics of global/local brand choices by investigating the experience of regret in global versus local brand purchases. Drawing on regret theory, the authors demonstrate in four complementary studies that the global/local availability of both chosen and forgone brands influences consumer responses to regrettable purchases and that the direction and magnitude of this influence depend on the consumers? product category schema and global identity. Study 1 shows that regrettable decisions to forgo global for local brands elicit stronger regret, lower satisfaction, and higher brand switching than regrettable purchases of global (vs. local) brands for consumers with a global brand superiority schema for the category; the inverse holds for consumers with a local brand superiority schema. Studies 2 and 3 replicate the effect and show that it is mediated by perceived decision justifiability and moderated by global identity. Study 4 further validates the observed effect using a real brand choice task in a category with a local brand?dominated schema. The findings reveal the postpurchase consequences of global/local brand choices and provide concrete advice for global/local branding strategies.",0
"Lit Up or Dimmed Down? Why, When, and How Regret Anticipation Affects Consumers? Use of the Global Brand Halo",Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Research has long established the existence of a global brand halo that benefits global brands by triggering ?global equals better? inferences by consumers. Nevertheless, little is known about the conditions under which this halo may or may not be used or about whether and, if so, how it can situationally fade. Drawing from regret theory, the authors posit that anticipating regret can conditionally both attenuate and accentuate consumers? use of the global brand halo and develop a serial conditional process model to explain the mechanism underlying regret?s influence. The results of two experimental studies show that anticipated regret affects global brand halo use?and subsequently relative preference for global or local brands?by increasing consumers? need to justify their purchase decision. Whether and how consumers will use the global brand halo depends on consumers? product category schema, while the intensity of the halo?s use depends on consumers? maximization tendency. The findings offer a decision-theory perspective on the competition between global and local brands and empirically based advice on managerial interventions that can influence global or local brand market shares.",0
Impact of Product-Harm Crises on Brand Equity: The Moderating Role of Consumer Expectations,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Brand equity is a valuable yet fragile asset. The mounting frequency of product-harm crises and ill-prepared corporate responses to such crises can have profound consequences for brand equity. Yet there is little research on the marketing impact of crises. The authors employ the expectations?evidence framework to understand the impact of firms' responses to crises on customer-based brand equity. The results of a field survey and two laboratory experiments indicate that consumers interpret firm response on the basis of their prior expectations about the firm. The interaction of expectations and firm response is shown to affect postcrisis brand equity. The authors draw implications for the expectations?evidence framework and for the outcomes of different types of firm response (i.e., unambiguous support, ambiguous response, and unambiguous stonewalling) on brand equity.",1
Closing the Marketing Capabilities Gap,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Marketers are being challenged by a deluge of data that is well beyond the capacity of their organizations to comprehend and use. Their strategies are not keeping up with the disruptive effects of technology-empowered customers; the proliferation of media, channel, and customer contact points; or the possibilities for microsegmentation. Closing the widening gap between the accelerating complexity of their markets and the limited ability of their organizations to respond demands new thinking about marketing capabilities. Three adaptive capabilities are needed: (1) Vigilant market learning that enhances deep market insights with an advance warning system to anticipate market changes and unmet needs, (2) adaptive market experimentation that continuously learns from experiments, and (3) open marketing that forges relationships with those at the forefront of new media and social networking technologies and mobilizes the skills of current partners. The benefits of these adaptive capabilities will only be realized in organizations that are more resilient and free-flowing, with vigilant leadership and more adaptive business models.",0
On Braggarts and Gossips: A Self-Enhancement Account of Word-of-Mouth Generation and Transmission,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Previous research on word of mouth (WOM) has presented inconsistent evidence on whether consumers are more inclined to share positive or negative information about products and services. Some findings suggest that consumers are more inclined to engage in positive WOM, whereas others suggest that consumers are more inclined to engage in negative WOM. The present research offers a theoretical perspective that provides a means to resolve these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, the authors compare the generation of WOM (i.e., consumers sharing information about their own experiences) with the transmission of WOM (i.e., consumers passing on information about experiences they heard occurred to others). They suggest that a basic human motive to self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive WOM (i.e., share information about their own positive consumption experiences) but transmit negative WOM (i.e., pass on information they heard about others' negative consumption experiences). The authors present evidence for self-enhancement motives playing out in opposite ways for WOM generation versus WOM transmission across four experiments.",1
Personalizing the Customization Experience: A Matching Theory of Mass Customization Interfaces and Cultural Information Processing,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Mass customization interfaces typically guide consumers through the configuration process in a sequential manner, focusing on one product attribute after the other. What if this standardized customization experience were personalized for consumers on the basis of how they process information? A series of large-scale field and experimental studies, conducted with Western and Eastern consumers, shows that matching the interface to consumers? culture-specific processing style enhances the effectiveness of mass customization. Specifically, presenting the same information isolated (by attribute) to Western consumers but contextualized (by alternative) to Eastern consumers increases satisfaction with and likelihood of purchasing the configured product, along with the amount of money spent on the product. These positive consumer responses emerge because of an increase in ?interface fluency??consumers? subjective experience of ease when using the interface. The authors advise firms to personalize the customization experience by employing processing-congruent interfaces across consumer markets.",1
Entrepreneurial Strategic Posture and Performance in Foreign Markets: The Critical Role of International Learning Effort,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Drawing from the attention-based view of the firm, this study adds to research on the entrepreneurial process of early and rapid internationalization by investigating the mediating role of international learning effort in the relationship between international young ventures? entrepreneurial strategic posture and international performance and explores how external and internal factors might moderate this role. Using data from international young ventures based in China, the authors show that an entrepreneurial strategic posture enhances international performance through the intensity of learning efforts expended in foreign markets. Furthermore, the findings reveal that this mediating effect of international learning effort is more pronounced at higher levels of external competitive intensity and intrafirm social interaction. This study has great significance for the increasing body of research on international new ventures in that it reveals a critical behavioral mechanism that underpins the learning advantages of these ventures.",0
Device Switching in Online Purchasing: Examining the Strategic Contingencies,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The increased penetration of mobile devices has a significant impact on customers? online shopping behavior, with customers frequently switching between mobile and fixed devices on the path to purchase. By accounting for the attributes of the devices and the perceived risks related to each product category, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the relationship between device switching and conversion rates. They test the hypotheses by analyzing clickstream data from a large online retailer and apply propensity score matching to account for self-selection in device switching. They find that when customers switch from a more mobile device, such as a smartphone, to a less mobile device, such as a desktop, their conversion rate is significantly higher. This effect is larger when product category?related perceived risk is higher, when the product price is higher, and when the customer's experience with the product category and the online retailer is lower. The findings illustrate the importance of focusing on conversions across the combination of devices used by customers on their path to purchase. Focusing on the conversions on a single device in isolation, as is usually done in practice, significantly overestimates conversions attributed to fixed devices at the expense of those attributed to mobile devices.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of the Service Climate in Boundary-Spanning Self-Managing Service Teams,Journal of Marketing,2004,"In this article, the authors examine antecedents and consequences of the service climate in boundary-spanning self-managing teams (SMTs) that deliver financial services. Using data from members of 61 SMTs and their customers, the authors show a differential impact of the SMT service climate on various marketing performance measures. Furthermore, they obtain support for independent group-level effects of intrateam support and team member flexibility on employee perceptions of the SMT service climate. Both effects are persistent over time and demonstrate that collective perceptions in the SMT have incremental value in the explanation of the service climate.",0
Quantifying Under- and Overreporting in Surveys through a Dual-Questioning-Technique Design,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In recent years, marketing researchers have become increasingly interested in under- and overreporting. However, there are few suitable approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model to quantify under- and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes within-person differences between answers obtained under direct questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408 respondents from a commercial web panel. The results show that respondents are averse to decreases in privacy and that randomized response is less effective if respondents provide biased responses to earlier direct questions.",1
Assessing Sensitive Consumer Behavior Using the Item Count Response Technique,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors propose a new truth-telling technique and statistical model called ?item count response technique? (ICRT) to assess the prevalence and drivers of sensitive consumer behavior. Monte Carlo simulations and a large-scale application to self-reported cigarette consumption among pregnant women (n = 1,315) demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. The ICRT provides more valid and precise prevalence estimates and is more efficient than direct self-reports and previous item count techniques. It accomplishes this by (1) incentivizing participants to provide truthful answers, (2) accounting for procedural nonadherence and differential list functioning, and (3) obviating the need for a control group. The ICRT also facilitates the use of multivariate regression analysis to relate the prevalence of the sensitive behavior to individual-level covariates for theory testing and policy analysis. The empirical application reveals a significant downward bias in prevalence estimates when questions about cigarette consumption were asked directly to pregnant women, or when standard item count techniques were used. The authors find lower smoking prevalence among women with higher levels of education and who are further along in their pregnancy, and a much higher prevalence among unmarried respondents.",1
Reducing Social Desirability Bias through Item Randomized Response: An Application to Measure Underreported Desires,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors present a polytomous item randomized response model to measure socially sensitive consumer behavior. It complements established methods in marketing to correct for social desirability bias a posteriori and traditional randomized response models to prevent social desirability bias a priori. The model allows for individual-level inferences at the construct level while protecting the privacy of respondents at the item level. In addition, it is possible to incorporate covariates in to various parts of the model. The proposed method is especially useful to study social issues in marketing. In the empirical application, the authors use a two-group experimental survey design and find that with the new procedure, participants report their sensitive desires more truthfully, with significant differences between socioeconomic groups. In addition, the method performs better than methods based on social desirability scales. Finally, the authors discuss truthfulness in data collection and confidentiality in data utilization.",1
Using Item Response Theory to Measure Extreme Response Style in Marketing Research: A Global Investigation,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Extreme response style (ERS) is an important threat to the validity of survey-based marketing research. In this article, the authors present a new item response theory?based model for measuring ERS. This model contributes to the ERS literature in two ways. First, the method improves on existing procedures by allowing different items to be differentially useful for measuring ERS and by accommodating the possibility that an item's usefulness differs across groups (e.g., countries). Second, the model integrates an advanced item response theory measurement model with a structural hierarchical model for studying antecedents of ERS. The authors simultaneously estimate a person's ERS score and individual- and group-level (country) drivers of ERS. Through simulations, they show that the new method improves on traditional procedures. They further apply the model to a large data set consisting of 12,506 consumers from 26 countries on four continents. The findings show that the model extensions are necessary to model the data adequately. Finally, they report substantive results about the effects of sociodemographic and national-cultural variables on ERS.",1
Productivity Metrics and Consumers? Misunderstanding of Time Savings,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The marketplace is replete with productivity metrics that put units of output in the numerator and one unit of time in the denominator (e.g., megabits per second [Mbps] to measure download speed). In this article, three studies examine how productivity metrics influence consumer decision making. Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller when consumers receive additional information about time savings through product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time savings. Consumers? intuitions about time savings are also more accurate when they estimate time savings than when they rank them. Estimates are based less on absolute than on proportional changes in productivity (and proportional changes correspond more with actual time savings).",1
The Anchor Contraction Effect in International Marketing Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"In an increasingly globalized marketplace, it is common for marketing researchers to collect data from respondents who are not native speakers of the language in which the questions are formulated. Examples include online customer ratings and internal marketing initiatives in multinational corporations. This raises the issue of whether providing responses on rating scales in a person's native versus second language exerts a systematic influence on the responses obtained. This article documents the anchor contraction effect (ACE), the systematic tendency to report more intense emotions when answering questions using rating scales in a nonnative language than in the native language. Nine studies (1) establish ACE, test the underlying process, and rule out alternative explanations; (2) examine the generalizability of ACE across a range of situations, measures, and response scale formats; and (3) explore managerially relevant and easily implementable corrective techniques.",1
Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross-Functional Collaboration: Examining the Different Routes to Product Innovation Performance,Journal of Marketing,2007,"There is consensus in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i.e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, market knowledge breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its integration, and the firm's performance in product innovation. The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in product innovation.",0
Effects of Traditional Advertising and Social Messages on Brand-Building Metrics and Customer Acquisition,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This study examines the relative effectiveness of traditional advertising, impressions generated through firm-to-consumer (F2C) messages on Facebook, and the volume and valence of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) messages on Twitter and web forums for brand-building and customer acquisition efforts. The authors apply vector autoregressive modeling to a unique data set from a European telecom firm. This modeling approach allows them to consider the interrelations among traditional advertising, F2C impressions, and volume and valence of C2C social messages. The results show that traditional advertising is most effective for both brand building and customer acquisition. Impressions generated through F2C social messages complement traditional advertising efforts. Thus, thoroughly orchestrating traditional advertising and a firm's social media activities may improve a firm's performance with respect to building the brand and encouraging customer acquisition. Moreover, firms can stimulate the volume and valence of C2C messages through traditional advertising that in turn influences brand building and acquisition. These findings can help managers leverage the different types of messages more adequately.",0
Attentional Contrast during Sequential Judgments: A Source of the Number-of-Levels Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Conjoint analysis is used to measure the importance of attribute-level trade-offs. A methodological anomaly is the number-of-levels effect; that is, as the number of intervening attribute levels increases, the derived importance weight of an attribute increases. The authors use three studies to show that attentional processes contribute to the number-of-levels effect. When there is an inequality in the number of levels across attributes, a given profile may include levels of one attribute that are relatively more novel than levels of the accompanying attributes. A process of attentional contrast directs attention toward the relatively novel attribute levels within each profile. Increased attention toward these attribute levels results in a larger derived importance weight for the attributes defined on those levels.",1
Investments in Consumer Relationships: A Cross-Country and Cross-Industry Exploration,Journal of Marketing,2001,"This research, investigating retailer?consumer relationships, has three distinct intended contributions: (1) It shows that different relationship marketing tactics have a differential impact on consumer perceptions of a retailer's relationship investment; (2) it demonstrates that perceived relationship investment affects relationship quality, ultimately leading to behavioral loyalty; and (3) it reveals that the effect of perceived relationship investment on relationship quality is contingent on a consumer's product category involvement and proneness to engage in retail relationships. The authors empirically cross-validate the underlying conceptual model by studying six consumer samples in a three-country, transatlantic, comparative survey that investigates two industries.",0
New Product Creativity: Understanding Contract Specificity in New Product Introductions,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Introducing new products necessitates that manufacturers not only carefully craft the initial contract terms with retailers but also consider how the specificity of the terms influences a retailer's relational behaviors throughout the duration of the contract, contingent upon the new product's success. The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate new product introductions using a multimethod design consisting of a survey of manufacturers and a repeated measures experiment with retailers. The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasingly specific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity are higher. When they are lower, the positive influence of new product creativity on contract specificity weakens and can in some instances become negative. The results also indicate that there is no significant change in a retailer's relational behaviors throughout a contract's duration when contract specificity is lower, regardless of the new product's success. However, under the condition of higher contract specificity, the retailer's relational behaviors increase (decrease) over a contract's duration when the new product is successful (unsuccessful).",0
"Strategic Manipulation of University Rankings, the Prestige Effect, and Student University Choice",Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"A multiperiod, theoretical model characterizes the relationship between a publication that ranks universities and prospective students who might use this ranking to decide which university to attend. The published ranking offers information about the universities? objective quality but also affects their prestige, which may increase student utility. This prestige effect gives the commercial publication incentive to act contrary to the best interest of the students. If a ranking created with the commonly used attribute-and-aggregate methodology creates prestige, then to maximize profit the publication needs to (1) choose attribute score weights that do not match student preferences and (2) alter those attribute score weights over time, even in the absence of changes to student preferences and/or education technology. Without a prestige effect, the publication should choose attribute score weights that match student preferences. This model also defines a student-optimal ranking methodology that maximizes the sum of the students? utilities. The results offer insights for prospective students who use existing rankings to choose a university, as well as which ranking designs would better align with students? preferences.",1
Global Diffusion of Technological Innovations: A Coupled-Hazard Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors propose a new methodology called the ?coupled-hazard approach? to study the global diffusion of technological innovations. Beyond its ability to describe discontinuous diffusion patterns, the method explicitly recognizes the conceptual difference between the timing of a country's introduction of the new technology (the so-called implementation stage; Rogers 1983) and the timing of the innovation's full adoption in the country (the confirmation stage). To illustrate the method, the authors apply it to the global diffusion of digital telecommunications switches across more than 160 countries.",1
Flow Signals: How Patterns over Time Affect the Acceptance of Start-Up Firms,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This study introduces the concept of flow signals?patterns of a firm's attributes over time?and contrasts them with point signals discussed in the literature to date. Three properties of flow signals are delineated: displacement, propensity, and reversals. The authors illustrate these properties using a start-up's research-and-development (R&D) spending and voluntary disclosure flows. The authors argue that the flow signal properties affect prospective customers? perceptions of a start-up's current and future product quality, thus influencing their purchase likelihood and, ultimately, the start-up's growth in sales. The findings, obtained from panel data comprised of U.S. venture-backed firms that went public in 2001?2005, suggest that sales growth is positively affected by displacement and propensity of both R&D spending and voluntary disclosures and negatively affected by R&D spending reversals. Furthermore, these effects are stronger for the relatively younger start-ups.",0
Relational Price Discounts: Consumers? Metacognitions and Nonlinear Effects of Initial Discounts on Customer Retention,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Practitioners increasingly employ relational price discounts by granting initial discounts to new customers with the goal of building sustainable relationships. However, extant research has provided mixed findings on the long-term effects of initial discounts on customer retention. The current research aims to reconcile this mixed evidence by exploring nonlinear effects of initial discounts on customer retention. Drawing on marketplace metacognition theory, the authors hypothesize that moderate initial discounts (5%?35%) have positive effects on customer retention, whereas low (<5%) and high (>35%) discounts have negative effects. Two large-scale field studies in an insurance company's car insurance branch and property insurance branch provide empirical support for the hypothesized patterns. An additional laboratory experiment tests the psychological mechanism underlying the nonlinear effects. When compared with low and high discounts, moderate initial discounts lead customers to form higher expectations of future relational benefits provided by the firm, as well as to lower their expectations of future discounts. Finally, this research offers customer lifetime value implications based on the depicted findings.",0
The Role of National Culture in Advertising's Sensitivity to Business Cycles: An Investigation across Continents,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors conduct a systematic investigation into the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditures in 37 countries, covering four key media: magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. They show that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying significant losses for brand manufacturers. Finally, an examination of 26 global companies shows that stock price performance is lower for companies that exhibit stronger procyclical advertising spending patterns.",1
Timing of Entry and the Foreign Subsidiary Performance of Japanese Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Delios and Makino adopt a contingency approach to analyze the relationship between timing of entry and a subsidiary's relative size and its survival. Using a sample of 6955 foreign entries of 703 Japanese firms, the authors develop and test hypotheses about asset-based competitive advantage moderators of timing of entry's influence on a subsidiary's relative size and survival. The results show that early entrants not only have a larger relative size but also have greater exit likelihood than do late entrants. The magnitude of these effects depends on the type of asset advantages a foreign investing firm possesses.",0
Complexity Effects in Choice Experiment?Based Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Many firms rely on choice experiment?based models to evaluate future marketing actions under various market conditions. This research investigates choice complexity (i.e., number of alternatives, number of attributes, and utility similarity between the most attractive alternatives) and individual differences in decision time as key factors that affect the predictive performance of models based on choice experiments, both within and between complexity conditions. The results show that complexity and individual decision time not only affect the error in consumer choice models but also consumers' decision strategy and systematic utilities. The authors introduce a complexity-adjusted mixed logit (CAM logit) model to capture the various influences of complexity in choice experiment?based models. They illustrate the consequences of complexity on choice behavior with market share predictions of the CAM logit model for different complexity conditions.",1
Searching in Choice Mode: Consumer Decision Processes in Product Search with Recommendations,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance? recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer?transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in ?choice mode.? Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations.",1
Marketing Mass-Customized Products: Striking a Balance between Utility and Complexity,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Increasingly, firms allow consumers to mass customize their products. In this study, the authors investigate consumers' evaluations of different mass customization configurations when they are asked to mass customize a product. For example, mass customization configurations may differ in the number of modules that can be mass customized. In the context of mass customization of personal computers, the authors find that mass customization configuration affects the product utility that consumers can achieve in mass customization as well as their perception of mass customization complexity. In turn, product utility and complexity affect the utility that consumers derive from using a certain mass customization configuration. More specifically, product utility has a positive effect and complexity has a negative effect on mass customization utility. The effect of complexity is direct as well as indirect because complexity also lowers product utility. The authors also find that consumers with high levels of product expertise consider mass customization configurations less complex than do consumers with low levels of product expertise and that for more-expert consumers, complexity has a less-negative impact on product utility. The study has important managerial implications for how companies can design their mass customization configuration to increase utility and decrease complexity.",1
Gaining Compliance and Losing Weight: The Role of the Service Provider in Health Care Services,Journal of Marketing,2004,"This research provides and empirically tests a conceptualization of health care services in which customer compliance outside of the service organization is necessary for successful health outcomes. Using data from service providers and customers in a weight-loss clinic, the authors examine the provider's role in gaining customer compliance. They find that provider expertise and attitudinal homophily play a role in bringing about customer role clarity, ability, and motivation. This study demonstrates that compliance leads to goal attainment, which results in satisfaction. More important, compliance also leads to satisfaction directly; consumers who comply with program requirements have greater satisfaction with the program.",0
The Effects of Shared Consumption on Product Life Cycles and Advertising Effectiveness: The Case of the Motion Picture Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers frequently consume hedonic products together with other consumers and derive value from this shared experience. This article investigates the impact of shared consumption, a type of social influence that determines the enjoyment of joint experiences, in the context of a typical hedonic product: movies. The authors argue that this type of influence has important consequences for the diffusion curves of hedonic goods that are consumed together and the effectiveness of advertising in generating launch and postlaunch sales. An empirically validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market, with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies? demand in markets with varying levels of shared consumption. The results provide key theoretical insights for the new product diffusion of hedonic products and help managers predict the financial consequences of their strategic decisions.",1
Cents or Percent? The Effects of Promotion Framing on Price Expectations and Choice,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Previous research has shown that the monetary value of a promotion (promotion depth) affects choice during the promotion period. However, as promotion depth increases, consumers might lower their expectations of future price, which in turn may threaten future choice when prices return to normal levels. This research examines how promotion frame (percentage off versus cents off) moderates the effect of promotion depth on postpromotion price expectations and choice. The findings indicate that compared with cents-off promotions, high-depth percentage-off promotions lead to higher postpromotion price expectations. Likewise, postpromotion choice is higher when high-depth promotions are framed in percentage-off than cents-off terms. The authors examine the process underlying the effect of promotion frame on price expectations and find that frame affects (1) consumers' perceptions of the promoted price and (2) the weight they place on the promoted price.",0
Is Your Product on the Right Side? The ?Location Effect? on Perceived Product Heaviness and Package Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors show that location of the product image on a package facade influences consumers? perceptions of the visual heaviness of the product and evaluations of the package. The ?heavier? (?lighter?) locations are on the bottom (top), right (left), and bottom-right (top-left) of the package. For products for which heaviness is considered a positive attribute, packages with the product image placed at heavy locations are preferred, whereas for products for which heaviness is considered a negative attribute, packages using light locations are preferred. Furthermore, in the former category (e.g., snacks), a salient health goal, as opposed to a neutral goal, weakens the preference for packages using heavy locations, though this moderating effect of goal is weaker for healthful snacks than for regular snacks. Store shelf context is a boundary condition, such that the location effects on perceived product heaviness and package evaluation appear in a contrasting context but disappear in an assimilating context. Moreover, perceived product heaviness mediates (1) the location effect on package evaluation and (2) the moderating role of store shelf context (i.e., mediated moderation).",1
"A ?Wide? Variety: Effects of Horizontal versus Vertical Display on Assortment Processing, Perceived Variety, and Choice",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors investigate how horizontal versus vertical displays of alternatives affect assortment processing, perceived variety, and subsequent choice. Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear. Two field studies, an eye-tracking study, and two lab studies support these conclusions.",1
When Do Transparent Packages Increase (or Decrease) Food Consumption?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Transparent packages are pervasive in food consumption environments. Yet prior research has not systematically examined whether and how transparent packaging affects food consumption. The authors propose that transparent packaging has two opposing effects on food consumption: it enhances food salience, which increases consumption (salience effect), and it facilitates consumption monitoring, which decreases consumption (monitoring effect). They argue that the net effect of transparent packaging on food consumption is moderated by food characteristics (e.g., unit size, appearance). For small, visually attractive foods, the monitoring effect is low, so the salience effect dominates, and people eat more from a transparent package than from an opaque package. For large foods, the monitoring effect dominates the salience effect, decreasing consumption. For vegetables, which are primarily consumed for their health benefits, consumption monitoring is not activated, so the salience effect dominates, which ironically decreases consumption. The authors? findings suggest that marketers should offer small foods in transparent packages and large foods and vegetables in opaque packages to increase postpurchase consumption (and sales).",0
TV Viewing and Advertising Targeting,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Television, the predominant advertising medium, is being transformed by the microtargeting capabilities of set-top boxes (STBs). By procuring impressions at the STB level (often denoted ?programmatic television?), advertisers can now lower per-exposure costs and/or reach viewers most responsive to advertising creatives. Accordingly, this study uses a proprietary, household-level, single-source data set to develop an instantaneous show and advertisement viewing model to forecast consumers' exposure to advertising and the downstream consequences for impressions and sales. Viewing data suggest that person-specific factors dwarf brand- or show-specific factors in explaining advertising avoidance, thereby suggesting that device-level advertising targeting can be more effective than existing show-level targeting. Consistent with this observation, the model indicates that microtargeting lowers advertising costs and raises incremental profits considerably relative to show-level targeting. Further, these advantages are amplified when advertisers can buy in real time as opposed to up front.",1
"A Cross-National Study of Evolutionary Origins of Gender Shopping Styles: She Gatherer, He Hunter?",Journal of International Marketing,2018,"By investigating gendered shopping styles across countries, the authors explore whether the differences between male and female shopping styles are greater than the differences in shopping styles exhibited by consumers across countries. With a conceptual model, this study tests an extant convergence hypothesis that predicts that men and women should grow more similar in their shopping styles as traditional gender-based divisions in wage and domestic labor disappear. The results of a survey of shopping behavior across 11 countries indicate though that men and women are evolutionarily predisposed to different shopping styles. These differences in shopping styles also are greater in countries with higher levels of gender equality. Empathizing, or the ability to tune in to others? thoughts and feelings, mediates shopping styles more for women; systemizing, or the degree to which a person possesses spatial skills, mediates shopping styles more for men. These results suggest that gender-based retail segmentation is more strategically relevant than country-based segmentation. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for international marketing theory and practice.",0
Firms' Strategic Leverage of Unplanned Exposure and Planned Advertising: An Analysis in the Context of Celebrity Endorsements,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Using data on advertising and sales of an innovative piece of golf equipment and the performance of its celebrity endorsers, the authors build a discrete-choice model that incorporates consumer awareness and preferences. They empirically investigate how celebrity endorsements affect consumer choices during new product introductions, the roles of planned advertising and unplanned media exposure, and how firms can strategically leverage the unplanned component. Model estimates reveal that wins in professional golf tournaments (which proxy for unplanned television exposure during weekly golf tournaments) affect awareness and that paid planned advertising impacts awareness and preferences. Focusing on Titleist equipment, counterfactual analysis demonstrates that the unplanned media exposure and planned advertising account for 22% and 24% of sales, respectively. The results also suggest that firms would benefit from coordinating the two. The planned portion should serve as a substitute for unplanned media exposure in the early stage and a complement as products age.",1
Harmful Effects of Mental Imagery and Customer Orientation During New Product Screening,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"One of the traditional tenets of marketing is that managers considering whether to develop and launch a new product should adopt a customer orientation and consider whether the product would satisfy the needs of customers. This research discovers that adopting a customer orientation causes managers to experience undesirable cognitive effects. The authors find that when considering customers? needs during the screening phase of the new product development process, managers often voluntarily engage in mental imagery (i.e., cognitive simulation) that biases their evaluation of a new product idea toward unrealistic optimism?even for a flawed product that would not satisfy customer needs. Furthermore, the authors find that managers who exert greater vigilance to achieve more accurate evaluations of the new product idea are especially vulnerable to the biasing effect, leading to less accurate evaluations. The authors test an analytical technique (i.e., a theory-based approach to analyzing the new product) that successfully allows a manager to adopt a customer orientation without an attendant bias toward optimism.",1
The Effects of Ingredient Branding Strategies on Host Brand Extendibility,Journal of Marketing,2002,"A decision of increasing importance is how ingredient attributes that make up a product should be labeled or branded, if at all. The authors conduct a laboratory experiment to consider how ingredient branding affects consumer acceptance of a novel line extension (or one that has not been introduced before) as well as the ability of the brand to leverage that ingredient to introduce future category extensions. The authors study two particular types of novel line extensions or brand expansions: (1) slot-filler expansions, in which the level of one existing product attribute changes (e.g., a scent in Tide detergent that is new to the laundry detergent category) and (2) new attribute expansions, in which an entirely new attribute or characteristic is added to the product (e.g., cough relief liquid added to Life Savers candy). The authors examine two types of ingredient branding strategies by branding the target attribute ingredient for the brand expansion with either a new name as a self-branded ingredient (e.g., Tide with its own EverFresh scented bath soap) or an established, well-respected name as a cobranded ingredient (e.g., Tide with Irish Spring scented bath soap). The results indicate that with slot-filler expansions, a cobranded ingredient facilitates initial expansion acceptance, but a self-branded ingredient leads to more favorable subsequent category extension evaluations. With more dissimilar new attribute expansions, however, a cobranded ingredient leads to more favorable evaluations of both the initial expansion and the subsequent category extension. The authors offer interpretation, implications, and limitations of the findings, as well as directions for further research.",0
When Old is Gold: The Role of Business Longevity in Risky Situations,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors examine how a service firm's longevity may affect consumers? perceptions of risk in conducting business with the firm. Depending on the nature of information available to consumers, a firm's longevity can act in one of two ways to reduce the consumers? perceived risk: (1) Longevity may act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality, or (2) availability of a longer track record of an older firm may allow consumers to make more precise prediction of the firm's future quality. The authors develop a set of hypotheses that relate these two effects to consumers? preferences and test them in a series of four experiments. They find that a firm's age can act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality. When consumers also have information about firms? intrinsic attributes, the effect of a firm's age as an extrinsic cue is diminished under conditions of high involvement. The experiments also show that consumers prefer firms with longer track records, especially when firms? performance/quality levels are subject to more variability. However, when consumers have high aspiration levels, they prefer firms with shorter track records, even though the consumers perceive these firms as riskier choices.",0
Forward Buying by Retailers,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Conventional wisdom in marketing holds that (1) retailer forward buying is a consequence of manufacturer trade promotions and (2) stockpiling units helps the retailer but hurts the manufacturer. This article provides a deeper understanding of forward buying by analyzing it within the context of manufacturer trade promotions, competition, and demand uncertainty. The authors find that regardless of whether the manufacturer offers a trade promotion, allowing the retailer to forward buy and hold inventory for the future can, under certain conditions, be beneficial for both parties. Disallowing forward buying by the retailer may lead the manufacturer to lower merchandising requirements and change the depth of the promotion. In competitive environments, there are situations in which retailers engage in forward buying because of competitive pressures in a prisoner's-dilemma situation. Finally, when the authors consider the case of uncertain demand, they find further evidence of strategic forward buying. In particular, the authors find cases in which the retailer orders a quantity that is higher than what it expects to sell in even the most optimistic demand scenario.",1
A Clusterwise Bilinear Multidimensional Scaling Methodology for Simultaneous Segmentation and Positioning Analyses,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The segmentation?targeting?positioning conceptual framework has been the traditional foundation and genesis of marketing strategy formulation. The authors propose a general clusterwise bilinear spatial model that simultaneously estimates market segments, their composition, a brand space, and preference/utility vectors per market segment; that is, the model performs segmentation and positioning simultaneously. After a review of related methodological research in the marketing, psychometrics, and classification literature streams, the authors present the technical details of the proposed two-way clusterwise bilinear spatial model. They develop an efficient alternating least squares procedure that estimates conditional globally optimum estimates of the model parameters within each iteration through analytic closed-form expressions. The authors present various model options. They provide a conceptual and empirical comparison with latent-class multidimensional scaling. They use an illustration of the new bilinear multidimensional scaling methodology with an actual commercial study sponsored by a large U.S. automotive manufacturer to examine buying/consideration intentions for small sport-utility vehicles. The authors conclude by summarizing the contributions of this research, discussing the marketing implications for managers, and providing several directions for further research.",1
The Joint Spatial Representation of Multiple Variable Batteries Collected in Marketing Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Marketing research studies pertaining to market segmentation, competitive market structure, and product/service positioning often involve the collection of multiple batteries of measurements from the same set of respondents (e.g., preferences, attribute ratings, demographics, proximity judgments). Various multidimensional scaling (MDS) and spatial methods have been used in the analysis of these variable batteries separately but not much effort has been expended in attempting to relate the individually derived spatial structures. The authors propose a new latent structure MDS procedure that is devised to represent jointly the structure in multiple batteries (preferences, proximities, and brand attribute ratings) of variables collected across the same set of respondents. The authors present the technical structure of the proposed maximum likelihood?based model and conceptually compare it with other related spatial MDS models. The authors present an illustration of the procedure with respect to the analysis of published proximity, preference, and brand ratings data collected from consumers who evaluated ten brands of soft drinks.",1
Executive Insights: Corporate Culture and Market Orientation: Comparing Indian and Japanese Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"The authors examine how organizational dimensions, including corporate culture and market orientation, affect performance in major Indian firms. The research uses a framework (the universal high performance model) developed in the United States and first tested in Japan to assess Indian organizational business-to-business relationships. Although there are some intuitively obvious substantive differences between Indian and Japanese companies, the general pattern of how various factors drive business performance is similar in both countries despite the different economic environments in India and Japan.",0
"Tigers, Dragons, and Others: Profiling High Performance in Asian Firms",Journal of International Marketing,2004,"A comparison of samples of business-to-business firms based in major cities in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam finds significant differences across countries on several organizational dimensions, including innovativeness, market orientation, and organizational climate and culture. The work is framed in a modified competing values model that is based on theoretical work from the West, but the developmental work for empirical application was carried out in Japan. In general, the differences observed in Asia are consistent with the countries? historical and cultural differences. Notably, however, the impact of the organizational dimensions on firm performance is statistically identical across the countries. Tests of hypotheses related to performance of firms in the Asian samples produced results that are qualitatively similar to a previous study of five industrial countries, but the importance weights of the individual factors are different. In particular, the significant effect of market orientation on performance is greater in Asia, whereas the similarly significant impact of innovativeness on performance is greater in the industrial countries.",0
Consumer Well-Being: Effects of Subgoal Failures and Goal Importance,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although there is increased awareness of issues surrounding consumer well-being, consumers often lack the personal commitment to improve their quality of life. This article builds on the concept of a goal hierarchy to propose that small acts may have unintended, large consequences on various domains of consumer well-being. A decrease in commitment to well-being goals (e.g., sustaining the natural environment) may stem from people's failure to achieve everyday subgoals (e.g., failing to recycle a newspaper). Four experiments in three contexts (i.e., consumer overspending, environmentally friendly behaviors, and charitable donations) show that when people perceive the endgoal as unimportant, even a single behavioral failure may reduce commitment to a well-being endgoal and weaken future intentions to perform behaviors that improve their quality of life. In addition, goal importance moderates the adverse relationship between subgoal performance and endgoal commitment. The authors present consumer-specific and marketer-controlled drivers of goal importance (i.e., goal visualization, self-relevance of goals, and aversive consequences of subgoal failure) and discuss actionable insights for practitioners.",0
Modeling Dynamic Heterogeneity Using Gaussian Processes,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand the rich heterogeneity of consumers, firms, and products. While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH?s rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.",1
The Shopping Momentum Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Shopping momentum occurs when an initial purchase provides a psychological impulse that enhances the purchase of a second, unrelated product. The authors propose that the most promising theoretical mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzer's (1990) theory of implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping momentum can be interrupted. Finally, they discuss alternative theoretical accounts for the results and explore consequences for marketing managers.",1
Toward Extending the Compromise Effect to Complex Buying Contexts,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Kivetz, Netzer, and Srinivasan (2004) make an important contribution to the theory of choice models by demonstrating through a rigorous analysis of four alternative models that the compromise effect systematically affects choice in a wide range of conditions. The value and impact of their work can be enhanced by extensions that examine key underlying institutional variables that may shape the nature and scope of compromise effects. The authors provide a set of issues that further research can effectively pursue in the context of institutional buying processes and the purchase of complex solutions rather than individual products.",1
To Buy or Not to Buy: Response Mode Effects on Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"This article extends research on evaluation differences in response modes to situations in which the no-choice option is available. Prior research on choice deferral has presented the no-choice option as just another response option (i.e., an unconditional brand-choice response mode), which has its primary focus on the selection decision. However, consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and choice deferral for the two response modes. The authors' theoretical account suggests that an initial focus on the buy/no-buy decision activates greater use of alternative-based evaluations, thus making purchase deferral more sensitive to the valence of shared features and category reference information than in the unconditional brand-choice mode. The authors provide process evidence for their account and consider limiting conditions.",1
The Effect of Forced Choice on Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Whereas most academic and industry studies of consumer preferences and decision making involve forced choice (i.e., participants are told to choose one of the presented product or service alternatives), buyers usually also have the option not to select any alternative. An implicit assumption in the experimental practice of forcing choice is that the no-choice option draws proportionately from the various available alternatives, such that the qualitative conclusions are unaffected. However, the authors propose that the no-choice option competes most directly with alternatives that buyers tend to select when they are uncertain about their preferences. Building on this general proposition, the authors show that the introduction of the no-choice option strengthens the attraction effect, weakens the compromise effect, and decreases the relative share of an option that is ?average? on all dimensions. They also examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of having the option not to choose and the conditions under which the no-choice option is likely to affect relative option shares. The results are consistent with the notion that the no-choice option provides an alternative way of resolving difficult choices that is not available when subjects are forced to choose. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.",1
Consumer Choice between Hedonic and Utilitarian Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In this article, the authors examine how consumer choice between hedonic and utilitarian goods is influenced by the nature of the decision task. Building on research on elaboration, the authors propose that the relative salience of hedonic dimensions is greater when consumers decide which of several items to give up (forfeiture choices) than when they decide which item to acquire (acquisition choices). The resulting hypothesis that a hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices was supported in two choice experiments. In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership. Finally, consistent with the experimental findings, a field survey showed that, relative to market prices, owners of relatively hedonic cars value their vehicles more than do owners of relatively utilitarian cars. The authors discuss theoretical implications of these reference-dependent preference asymmetries and explore consequences for marketing managers and other decision makers.",1
Self-Signaling and the Costs and Benefits of Temptation in Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The literature on self-control emphasizes that temptation is costly. The authors propose that temptation entails not only costs but also benefits for consumers. These arise from self-signaling effects of how consumers handle tempting choice options. Succumbing to temptation is a (costly) self-signal of weak willpower, whereas resisting temptation is a (beneficial) self-signal of strong willpower. Five experiments demonstrate that these self-signaling costs and benefits of temptation depend not only on the chosen item but also on the temptation from the nonchosen options. The authors discuss theoretical implications of their findings for research on impulsive choice and self-control and on self-signaling and managerial implications for pricing and assortment strategies.",1
Fast-Food Consumption and the Ban on Advertising Targeting Children: The Quebec Experience,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Amid growing concerns about childhood obesity and the associated health risks, several countries are considering banning fast-food advertising targeting children. In this article, the authors study the effect of such a ban in the Canadian province of Quebec. Using household expenditure survey data from 1984 to 1992, authors examine whether expenditure on fast food is lower in those groups affected by the ban than in those that are not. The authors use a triple difference-indifference methodology by appropriately defining treatment and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week. Overall, the authors estimate that the ban reduced fast-food consumption by Us$88 million per year. The study suggests that advertising bans can be effective provided media markets do not overlap.",1
How Customer Self-Determination Influences Relational Marketing Outcomes: Evidence from Longitudinal Field Studies,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This article examines the role of customers' self-determination, defined as a person's perception of joining a firm on his or her own initiative versus being induced to join, in influencing relational outcomes for firms. In the first two studies, the author finds evidence of more relational behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) and higher motivation levels regarding purchase (Study 2) among self-determined (versus firm-determined) customers. This article also examines how customers' self-determination interacts with two types of relational marketing programs: reminder coupons, which consumers view as relatively more controlling, and relational rewards, which they view as relatively more informative of their value to the firm. The results reveal that sending a stylized reminder coupon to encourage repeat purchase has negative effects (Study 3) and that automatic enrollment in a relational rewards program has positive effects on relational behaviors of self-determined customers (Study 4). Firm-determined customers are less influenced by rewards in both cases. These findings question the effectiveness of aggressive acquisition and reminder marketing programs in cultivating customer relationships, provide a straightforward way to identify attractive relational candidates in consumer settings, and suggest methods by which to (and how not to) market to self-determined consumers.",1
The Service Models of Frontline Employees,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Service literature has implicitly assumed that frontline employees (FLEs) share a common understanding of the term ?customer service.? Perhaps because of this assumption, differences in FLE attitudes, behaviors, and performance have been ascribed to organizational characteristics, social environment, job characteristics, or personality. This article shows that FLEs? interpretations of customer service also matter. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this study finds that three distinct interpretations of customer service, or service models, exist among retail FLEs: (1) the act of giving customers what they ask for, efficiently and courteously; (2) a means to accomplishing immediate objectives, such as sales quotas; and (3) the formation of mutually beneficial relationships with customers through problem solving. Service models are related to FLEs? customer orientation, competence, surface and deep acting, and interpersonal values. The findings indicate that differences in FLEs? attitudes, behaviors, and performance can arise from their keeping of different service models; illuminate individual-level beliefs underlying service typologies, such as goods- and service-dominant logic; and suggest that FLE recruitment and training should take service models into account.",0
How Shopping Mall Service Quality Affects Customer Loyalty Across Developing Countries: The Moderation of the Cultural Context,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Cross-cultural studies indicate the importance of service quality and loyalty in different nations, but they do not specify how cultural context affects the relationships between such constructs. The current research investigates whether mall service quality and its specific dimensions affect loyalty, as well as how cultural contexts moderate the relationships between these constructs in three developing countries (Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia). With a sample of 750 real customers, the authors show that mall service quality and its specific dimensions affect customer loyalty through the positive mediation of customer satisfaction and mall perceived value. Depending on the country, service quality dimensions (mall physical aspects, reliability, problem solving, and personnel attention) have distinct effects on customer loyalty. Furthermore, mall service quality drives customer loyalty positively in Morocco and Senegal. Customer satisfaction has a positive effect on customer loyalty in Senegal and Tunisia. Due to their different cultural contexts, these three developing countries do not exhibit a homogeneous pattern.",0
On the Interplay Between Consumer Dispositions and Perceived Brand Globalness: Alternative Theoretical Perspectives and Empirical Assessment,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Although prior research is congested with constructs intended to capture consumers? dispositions toward globalization and global/local products, their effects appear to replicate with difficulty, and little is known about the underlying theoretical mechanisms. This investigation revisits the relationship between prominent consumer dispositions (consumer ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, global/local identity, globalization attitude) and perceived brand globalness as determinants of consumer responses to global brands. Drawing on selective perception and social identity theories, the authors consider several theory-based model specifications that reflect alternative mechanisms through which key consumer dispositions relate to brand globalness and affect important brand-related outcomes. By employing a flexible model that simultaneously accounts for moderating, mediating, conditional, and direct effects, we empirically test these rival model specifications. A meta-analysis of 264 effect sizes obtained from 13 studies with 23 unique data sets and a total sample of 1,410 consumers raises concerns regarding the (potentially overstated) utility of consumer dispositions for explaining consumer responses to global brands. It also reveals a need for further conceptual contemplation of their function in international consumer research and managerial practice.",0
Managerial Assessments of Export Performance: Conceptual Framework and Empirical Illustration,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Export performance has long been an issue of concern in the literature; however, there has been little research on managers? evaluations of their firms? performance in the presence of multiple export objectives. This study proposes a framework for understanding managerial assessments of export performance and illustrates its application using the analytic hierarchy process methodology. The framework explicitly acknowledges that the importance of different export objectives may differ both within and between firms and that the latter may also differ in terms of the frame of reference and/or time horizon used when assessing the attainment of objectives. Using this framework, the authors construct a composite index of assessed export performance that allows for valid interfirm comparisons. They use data from an online survey of 171 exporting firms to demonstrate the application of the framework and the assessed export performance index in an empirical setting.",0
Drivers of Export Segmentation Effectiveness and Their Impact on Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"In recent years, export segmentation effectiveness has attracted increasing attention in academic literature. The current study acknowledges this construct's ability to capture the proximal outcomes of export segmentation efforts and contributes to the literature by investigating its key drivers and link to export performance. The results identify export segmentation commitment, export segmentation strategy, and number of segmentation bases used as the key drivers of export segmentation effectiveness. A segments-within-countries strategy proves the most promising choice because it affects all export segmentation dimensions, which, with the exception of cost reduction, are significantly linked to customer satisfaction, strategic export performance, and, ultimately, financial export performance. The findings also provide support for the sequential segmentation ? targeting ? positioning process and highlight the importance of managerial commitment to export segmentation when facing heterogeneous markets.",0
Index Construction with Formative Indicators: An Alternative to Scale Development,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Although the methodological literature is replete with advice regarding the development and validation of multi-item scales based on reflective measures, the issue of index construction using formative measures has received little attention. The authors seek to address this gap by (1) examining the nature of formative indicators, (2) discussing ways in which the quality of formative measures can be assessed, and (3) illustrating the proposed procedures with empirical data. The aim is to enhance researchers' understanding of formative measures and assist them in their index construction efforts.",1
American Girl and the Brand Gestalt: Closing the Loop on Sociocultural Branding Research,Journal of Marketing,2009,"This article describes an investigation of the American Girl brand that provides a more complete and holistic understanding of sociocultural branding. Recent research on emotional branding, together with prior work on brands? symbolic nature and their role as relationship partners, represents a significant shift in the way marketers think about brands and brand management. However, a full understanding of powerful and emotionally resonant brands has been elusive, in part because sociocultural branding knowledge has accumulated in a piecemeal way and lacks coherence and integrity. In addition, powerful brands are extraordinarily complex and multifaceted, but in general they have been studied from a single perspective in a single setting. On the basis of a qualitative exploration of the American Girl brand that is both deep and broad, the authors posit that an emotionally powerful brand is best understood as the product of a complex system, or gestalt, whose component parts are in continuous interplay and together constitute a whole greater than their sum. Studying American Girl from the perspectives of various stakeholder groups in many of the venues in which the brand is manifest, the authors attempt to close the sociocultural branding research loop and identify implications for brand management.",0
When Two Rights Make a Wrong: Searching Too Much in Ordered Environments,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In electronic shopping, screening tools are used to sort through many options, assess their fit with a consumer's utility function, and recommend options in a list ordered from predicted best to worst. When the most promising options are at the beginning of the list, even seemingly advantageous factors (e.g., lower search cost, greater selection) that prompt consideration of more options degrade choice quality by (1) lowering the average quality of considered options and (2) lowering customers' selectivity in focusing attention on the more mediocre rather than the better options from the actively considered set. Study 1 shows that lowering search costs diminishes choice quality in an ordered environment. Study 2 shows that presenting consumers with the top 50 rather than the top 15 recommendations has the same effect. Study 3 shows that greater accuracy motivation in combination with lower search cost diminishes choice quality because consumers are encouraged to consider a wider range of options (lower-quality consideration sets), which ultimately leads to worse choices.",1
"Great Expectations?! Assortment Size, Expectations, and Satisfaction",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Recent research challenges the idea that greater choice is always desirable, showing that larger assortments can increase choice deferral and switching. The current research demonstrates that even when consumers make a purchase, the same item may generate lower satisfaction when chosen from a larger rather than a smaller assortment. The authors explain this effect in terms of an expectation-disconfirmation mechanism. When assortments are small, consumers have low expectations about their ability to match their preferences. As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers? expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set. Either less positive or more negative disconfirmation leads to lower choice satisfaction. The results from three studies support this expectation-based process and establish this mechanism in addition to alternative explanations, such as choice overload.",1
A Sales Force?Specific Theory-of-Mind Scale: Tests of Its Validity by Classical Methods and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The goal of this article is to develop a new theory-driven scale for measuring salespeople's interpersonal-mentalizing skills?that is, a salesperson's ability to ?read the minds? of customers in the sense of first recognizing customer intentionality and processing subtle interpersonal cues and then adjusting volitions accordingly. Drawing from research on autism and neuroscience, the authors develop a model of brain functioning that differentiates better-skilled from less-skilled interpersonal mentalizers. They establish the convergent, discriminant, concurrent, predictive, and nomological validities of measures of the scale using four methods in four separate studies: confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, multitrait?multimethod matrix procedures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The study is one of the first to test the validity of measures of a scale not only in traditional ways but also by adopting procedures from neuroscience.",1
Understanding What's in a Brand Rating: A Model for Assessing Brand and Attribute Effects and Their Relationship to Brand Equity,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Although brand ratings capture the favorability of brand associations, they often do not enable marketing managers to disentangle brand-specific associations from other effects. In this article, the authors present a decompositional model for analyzing brand ratings that addresses this nagging problem and provide insights for understanding the sources of brand equity. Starting with consumers' perceived level of a brand on an attribute, the authors decompose the rating into two components: brand-specific associations and general brand impressions. Brand-specific associations refer to features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand and that differentiate it from the competition. General brand impressions refer to general impressions about the brand that are based on a more holistic view of the brand. In this article, the authors focus on two principal issues: (1) How can the sources of bias that may be present in brand ratings be disentangled? and (2) Do these putatively biasing effects, if present, have any managerial implications for brand equity? The authors demonstrate the properties and advantages of the model in the context of three empirical applications.",1
Global Brands in the United States: How Consumer Ethnicity Mediates the Global Brand Effect,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Previous cross-cultural research has demonstrated a consistently positive effect of brand globality on consumer perceptions, attitudes, and purchase intentions. The authors evaluate these effects on three ethnic segments of U.S. consumers. Drawing on survey data analysis and the estimates of a structural equation model, the research shows that associations with global brands as a general category vary across ethnic groups. Caucasian consumers show less of an appreciation of global brands, whereas African Americans and Hispanics show patterns similar to those in prior research. Although the average consumer views brand globality as an attribute of little importance, the structural equation findings show a direct effect of globality on attitudes and purchases. Overall, mainstream consumers in the United States are less favorable toward global brands than minority groups but patronize them at the same overall rate.",0
Cognitive and Affective Reactions of U.S. Consumers to Global Brands,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors find that U.S. consumers hold contradictory notions of what characterizes a global brand beyond its wide recognition, availability, and standardization across markets. In particular, they find that the association of brand globality with higher quality is not as strong as the literature has proposed and that affect directly influences how people perceive global brands. The initial results imply that previous research on globality effects may have confounded brand globality and brand strength and that the latter is responsible for the quality effect. A follow-up study shows that for most consumers, brand globality is associated with positive affect and that this affect is also reflected among consumers who are explicitly against global brands. The authors conclude that response to global brands is driven more by affect and less by cognition.",0
"Control, Conflict, and Performance: A Study of U.S.-Chinese Joint Ventures",Journal of International Marketing,1997,"This study was designed to test empirically the linkages between control, conflict, and performance using a sample of U.S.-Chinese joint ventures established in China during the period of 1979?1989. Data were gathered through a questionnaire survey among U.S. managers and personal interviews with both U.S. and Chinese general managers in the selected joint ventures. Results showed that dominant managerial control exercised by the foreign partner had a positive impact on the perceived joint venture performance. The study identified major areas in which conflict between joint venture partners occurred. Empirical evidence was found that conflict between joint venture partners significantly hindered joint venture performance.",0
A Theory of Intraperson Games,Journal of Marketing,2007,"A wide variety of theories across disciplines posit the existence of multiple inner preferences (selves, drives, or agents) within each person, whose conflicts must be resolved for a person to reach a decision. Despite their strong validity, these theories have not been incorporated into mainstream management science literature because of their qualitative nature. In this article, the author proposes a theory of intraperson games (TIG) to fill this important gap. Building on social welfare literature and standard (multiperson) game theory, the TIG defines two types of intraperson players, and each has a unique strategy set. The first type, the efficiency agent, attempts to maximize the total utility for the entire set of selves that reside in a person's mind. The second type, the equity agent, strives to balance the utilities that each of these selves receives. The TIG states that an individual decision is the outcome of the strategic interaction between the efficiency agent and the equity agent. Thus, standard consumer utility theory is a special case of the TIG if the role of the equity agent is ignored. A mathematical apparatus is provided for the TIG and is defined in a way similar to standard (multiperson) game theory. As a general quantitative theory, the TIG can be applied to many different contexts across disciplines, including, but not limited to, management science. The author demonstrates one such application for variety-seeking behavior and shows that stochastic variety seeking is a mixed-strategy equilibrium in an intraperson game. Key theoretical insights from this applied model are subsequently validated in an empirical study.",0
An Incentive-Aligned Mechanism for Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article specifies, analyzes, and validates a rigorous and practical truth-telling mechanism (game) for conjoint applications. The mechanism requires only one real product variation and has truth telling in conjoint as its Bayesian Nash equilibrium, thus making it possible to incentive align participants in most conjoint applications. Using the iPod package as the context, the author shows empirically that the mechanism substantially improves purchase prediction compared with a standard conjoint procedure.",1
Incentive-Aligned Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Because most conjoint studies are conducted in hypothetical situations with no consumption consequences for the participants, the extent to which the studies are able to uncover ?true? consumer preference structures is questionable. Experimental economics literature, with its emphasis on incentive alignment and hypothetical bias, suggests that more realistic incentive-aligned studies result in stronger out-of-sample predictive performance of actual purchase behaviors and provide better estimates of consumer preference structures than do hypothetical studies. To test this hypothesis, the authors design an experiment with conventional (hypothetical) conditions and parallel incentive-aligned counterparts. Using Chinese dinner specials as the context, the authors conduct a field experiment in a Chinese restaurant during dinnertime. The results provide strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice conjoint analysis, in that incentive-aligned choice conjoint outperforms hypothetical choice conjoint in out-of-sample predictions. To determine the robustness of the results, the authors conduct a second study that uses snacks as the context and considers only the choice treatments. This study confirms the results by providing strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice analysis in out-of-sample predictions. The results provide a strong motivation for conjoint practitioners to consider conducting studies in realistic settings using incentive structures that require participants to ?live with? their decisions.",1
Unstructured Direct Elicitation of Decision Rules,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors investigate the feasibility of unstructured direct elicitation (UDE) of decision rules consumers use to form consideration sets. They incorporate incentives into the tested formats that prompt respondents to state noncompensatory, compensatory, or mixed rules for agents who will select a product for the respondents. In a mobile phone study, two validation tasks prompt respondents to indicate which of 32 mobile phones they would consider from a fractional design of features and levels. The authors find that UDE predicts consideration sets better, across both profiles and respondents, than a structured direct-elicitation method. It predicts comparably to established incentive-aligned compensatory, noncompensatory, and mixed decompositional methods. In a more complex automotive study, noncompensatory decomposition is not feasible and additive-utility decomposition is strained, but UDE scales well. The authors align incentives for all methods using prize indemnity insurance to award a chance at $40,000 for an automobile plus cash. They conclude that UDE predicts consideration sets better than either an additive decomposition or an established structured direct-elicitation method (CASEMAP).",1
Hiding Gifts Behind the Veil of Vouchers: On the Effect of Gift Vouchers Versus Direct Gifts in Conditional Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"To boost sales, marketers often conduct promotions that offer gifts conditional on the purchase of a focal product. Such promotions can present gifts in different formats: customers could be informed that they will receive a gift directly or that they will receive a voucher entitling them to a gift. Normatively speaking, the two formats are equivalent, as a voucher?s value is identical to that of the gift it represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs. direct gift) influences consumers? intention to purchase the focal product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that, compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts. This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between the focal product and the gift, reducing people?s tendency to compare the gift?s value with the focal product?s value. The effect observed can be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value.",1
"Driving Online and Offline Sales: The Cross-Channel Effects of Traditional, Online Display, and Paid Search Advertising",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The current marketing environment is characterized by a surge in multichannel shopping and increasing choice of advertising channels. This situation requires firms to understand how advertising in one channel (e.g., online) influences sales in another channel (e.g., offline). This article studies the presence, magnitude, and carryover of these cross-channel effects for online advertising (display and search) and traditional media. The analysis considers how these advertising expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly through intermediate search advertising metrics?namely, impressions and click-through rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities. Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising. Notably, the authors find that traditional advertising decreases paid search click-through rates, thus reducing the net cross effect of traditional advertising.",1
Managing Status: How Luxury Brands Shape Class Subjectivities in the Service Encounter,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Although a large body of research has investigated how consumers use goods to signal their status, little is known about how brands manage status. The very few studies that have examined this topic are grounded in the traditional conception of status and focus on the possession and display of status signals. The authors offer an alternative understanding of status management by investigating the role of interactions in the service encounter. Drawing from extensive ethnographic work in luxury stores, they investigate how brands (re)configure the status games that surface in the service encounter. They show that through the material and social cues of the servicescape, brands shape consumers? class subjectivities?that is, they make consumers behave as class subjects who have a specific understanding of their position in the social hierarchy. Thus, managing status requires the active creation and management of consumers as class subjects. There is a shift from managing branded goods that signal status to managing customer experiences that make consumers enact status positions. This research helps identify new ways to manage status brands, especially luxury brands.",0
"Need for Cognitive Closure, Risk Aversion, Uncertainty Changes, and Their Effects on Investment Decisions",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Investment decisions play a crucial role in the way consumers manage their wealth, and therefore, it is important to understand how consumers make these decisions. This research contributes to this attempt by examining consumers? investment decisions in response to new information about changes in uncertainty in financial markets. The authors identify possible conditions under which consumers, despite having new information about changes in market uncertainty, are less likely to assimilate the new information and consequently do not make investment decisions that are in line with their risk-aversion levels. Specifically, in a series of studies, the authors show that high rather than low need for cognitive closure can lead to a lack of openness to new information and therefore may dilute consumers? tendency to update their investment portfolios in a way that reflects their risk preferences. In addition, the authors address possible ways to influence consumers? assimilation of new information, to help even those with high need for cognitive closure make investment decisions that are in line with their levels of risk aversion.",1
Learning and Exit Behavior of New Entrant Discount Airlines from City-Pair Markets,Journal of Marketing,2007,"In this research, the authors investigate firms' exit behaviors. On the basis of extant literature in economics, strategy, and marketing, the authors identify market- and firm-specific factors that influence exit behavior. They account for firms' uncertainty about a market's true attractiveness after entry on the probability of exiting a market. To evaluate exit decisions, they propose a Bayesian belief-updating model of learning embedded in a logit model that incorporates market- and firm-specific factors. The estimated evolution of beliefs over time enables the authors to determine whether firms use market information to update their prior beliefs about market attractiveness. The authors empirically investigate the market exits of new entrant discount airlines from city-pair markets. The results suggest that a combination of several market and firm factors influences exit behavior. Airlines' prior beliefs about market attractiveness are not necessarily consistent with the market's intrinsic attractiveness, and firms learn about the true market attractiveness over time. The authors also provide model comparisons with extant approaches to studying market exit and find that the proposed approach provides a better fit and predictive ability.",0
Successful and Unsuccessful Sales Calls: Measuring Salesperson Attributions and Behavioral Intentions,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Applying attribution theory to consumer behavior issues is quite common. In the managerial arena, previous research suggests that salespeople's attribution processes affect their expectancies for success and future behavior. However, no published research has developed adequate measures that might be used to examine the full range of attributional responses for sales success or failure and the behaviors that are likely to follow such attributions. The goal of this research is to develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral scales for sales success and failure and validate such scales in a real-world context?among field sales representatives. Following Churchill's (1979) recommended process, the authors develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral intention scales that is applicable to a field sales force setting. The authors then measure 228 financial services representatives' performance attributions for a previous sales interaction; their intended behaviors for a future, similar selling situation; and their personal characteristics. The authors test the validities of the scales and examine the usefulness of applying the scales within a theoretically justified nomological network of relationships.",0
"Internal Benefits of Service-Worker Customer Orientation: Job Satisfaction, Commitment, and Organizational Citizenship Behaviors",Journal of Marketing,2004,"Implementation of the marketing concept in service firms is accomplished through individual service employees and their interactions with customers. Although prior research has established a link between service-worker customer orientation and performance outcomes, little research has addressed other potentially important outcomes of customer orientation. Drawing from the literature on person?situation interaction and fit theory, the authors develop and test a model that explains how service-worker customer orientation affects several important job responses, including perceived job fit, job satisfaction, commitment to the firm, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Across three field studies in two distinct services industries, the results indicate that the positive influence of customer orientation on certain job responses is stronger for service workers who spend more time in direct contact with customers than for workers who spend less time with customers. The authors discuss the implications of the results for services marketing managers and researchers.",0
Factors that Influence Multinational Corporations? Control of Their Operations in Foreign Markets: An Empirical Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Multinational corporations? (MNCs?) control over their foreign operations plays an important role in implementing their global marketing strategy. In the past, transaction cost analysis and bargaining power theory have been widely cited to explain the degree of control MNCs exert over their foreign operations. However, research explicitly combining these two perspectives has been limited. To address the gap in the literature, the authors present a joint model that combines the two alternative theories to explain MNCs? control, and they compare their relative explanatory power. Using primary survey data, they perform an empirical test of the relative explanatory power of these two theories. The results suggest that three factors, two drawn from bargaining power theory and one from transaction cost analysis, are key factors in explaining MNCs? degree of control over their foreign operations. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications.",0
Do Business and Political Ties Differ in Cultivating Marketing Channels for Foreign and Local Firms in China?,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Despite the prominence of social ties in emerging economies, it remains unclear whether and how social ties matter in cultivating marketing channels for both local and foreign firms in China. Moreover, few studies have explicitly distinguished and examined the roles of business versus political ties. Drawing on the resource-based view and social network theory, the authors propose and test the moderating effects of political ties and business ties on channel capability?performance relationships. The findings from a survey of 342 firms indicate that the value of channel capability is conditional on political and business ties, but in opposite directions: business ties impede and political ties strengthen the effect of channel capability on firm performance. Furthermore, the moderating role of social ties is stronger for local, nonleading firms than for foreign, leading firms.",0
"Effective Distributor Governance in Emerging Markets: The Salience of Distributor Role, Relationship Stages, and Market Uncertainty",Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Effective governance of distributors represents a critical success factor for firms operating in emerging markets such as China. To increase understanding of this issue, the authors adopt a role theory framework to delineate the effect of fit between governance strategies and distributor role orientations on channel outcomes. They also examine the way two contingency factors (relationship stages and market uncertainty) may moderate the impact of this fit. Using a four-industry survey of distributors in China, the authors confirm the salience of strategic fit between the manufacturer's governance strategy and the distributor's role orientation (in short, governance fit), in support of propositions postulated in recent channel governance research. The findings also indicate that the effects of this governance fit are dependent on the stages of the channel relationship (buildup versus mature) but not market uncertainty. This study extends the current literature and suggests the need for finer, phase-oriented dynamic governance strategies in the Chinese market.",0
Quantifying the Benefits of Individual-Level Targeting in the Presence of Firm Strategic Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors develop a method to quantify the benefits of individual-level targeting when the data reflect firm strategic behavior?that is, when firms (1) are engaged in targeting and (2) take into account the actions of competing firms. This article studies a pharmaceutical firm's decision on the allocation of detailing visits across individual physicians. For this analysis, the authors develop, at the individual level, a model of prescriptions and a model of detailing. Using physician panel data, they estimate, at the physician level, the parameters of the prescription and detailing models jointly using full-information Bayesian methods. The results suggest that accounting for firm strategic behavior improves profitability by 14%?23% compared with segment-level targeting. In addition, ignoring firm strategic behavior underestimates the benefit of individual-level targeting significantly. The authors provide reasons for this finding. They also carry out several robustness checks to test the validity of the modeling assumptions.",1
Preference Dynamics in Sequential Consumer Choice with Defaults,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research examines the impact of defaults on product choice in sequential-decision settings. Whereas prior research has shown that a default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer preferences may evolve across choices due to ?spillover? effects from one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects. The findings show that firms? setting of high-price defaults with the aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can backfire through the attenuation of spillover. In addition to advancing the understanding of the interplay between defaults and preference dynamics, insights from this research have important practical implications for firms applying defaults in sequential choices.",1
Selective Sampling for Binary Choice Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Marketing problems sometimes pertain to the analysis of dichotomous dependent variables, such as ?buy? and ?not buy? or ?respond? and ?not respond.? One outcome can strongly outnumber the other, such as when many households do not respond (e.g., to a direct mailing). In such situations, an efficient data-collection strategy is to sample disproportionately more from the smaller group. However, subsequent statistical analysis must account for this sampling strategy. In this article, the authors put forward the econometric method that can correct for the sample selection bias, when this method does not lead to a loss in precision. The authors illustrate the method for synthetic and real-life data and document that reductions of more than 50% in sample sizes can be obtained.",1
Seeding as Part of the Marketing Mix: Word-of-Mouth Program Interactions for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Seeded marketing campaigns (SMCs) have become part of the marketing mix for many fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. In addition to making large investments in advertising and sales promotions, these firms now encourage seed agents or microinfluencers to discuss brands with friends and acquaintances to create further value. It is thus critical to understand how an FMCG seeding program interacts with traditional marketing tools when estimating the effectiveness of such efforts. However, the issue is still underexplored. The authors present the first empirical analysis of this question using a rich data set collected on four brands from various European FMCG markets. They combine advertising and sales promotion data from FMCG brand managers with sales and retail variables from market research companies as well as firm-created word-of-mouth variables from SMC agencies. The authors analyze the data using several approaches, confronting challenges of endogeneity and multicollinearity. They consistently find that firm-created word of mouth through SMC programs interacts negatively with all tested forms of advertising but positively with promotional activities. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding the utility of SMCs and how they should be managed. The analysis implies that SMCs may increase total sales by approximately 3%?18% throughout the campaigns.",0
A Probit Model with Structured Covariance for Similarity Effects and Source of Volume Calculations,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Distributional assumptions for random utility models play an important role in relating observed product attributes to choice probabilities. Choice probabilities derived with independent errors have the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives, which often does not match observed substitution behavior and leads to inaccurate calculations of source of volume when new entrants are introduced. In this article, the authors parameterize the covariance matrix for a probit model so that similar brands in the preference space have higher correlation than dissimilar brands, resulting in higher rates of substitution. They find across multiple data sets that similarity based on overall utility, not just attributes, defines products as similar with heightened rates of substitution. The proposed model results in better in-sample and predictive fits to the data and more realistic measures of substitution for a new product introduction.",1
The Relative Effects of Business-to-Business (vs. Business-to-Consumer) Service Innovations on Firm Value and Firm Risk: An Empirical Analysis,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs? effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.",0
Service Innovativeness and Firm Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Service innovativeness, or the propensity to introduce service innovations to satisfy customers and improve firm value at acceptable risk, has become a critical organizational capability. Service innovations are enabled primarily by the Internet or people, corresponding to two types of innovativeness: e- and p-innovativeness. The authors examine the determinants of service innovativeness and its interrelationships with firm-level customer satisfaction, firm value, and firm risk and investigate the differences between e- and p-innovativeness in these relationships. They develop a conceptual model and estimate a system of equations on a unique panel data set of 1049 innovations over five years, using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and seemingly unrelated regression approaches. The results reveal important asymmetries between e- and p-innovativeness. Whereas e-innovativeness has a positive and significant direct effect on firm value, p-innovativeness has an overall significantly positive effect on firm value through its positive effect on customer satisfaction but only in human-dominated industries. Both e- and p-innovativeness are positively associated with idiosyncratic risk, but customer satisfaction partially mediates this relationship for p-innovativeness to lower this risk in human-dominated industries. The findings suggest that firms should nurture e-innovativeness in most industries and p-innovativeness in human-dominated industries.",1
Executive Insights: Global Portfolio Planning and Market Interconnectedness,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Previous approaches to portfolio analysis in international markets focused on the country as the basic portfolio unit and relied on an assessment of market attractiveness and competitive strength to determine how to allocate resources. This article proposes an approach to international portfolio analysis based on an examination of the interconnectedness of geographic markets and product businesses. This enables management to identify strategic portfolio units (SPUs) based on market interconnectedness, as well as competitive strength, and market attractiveness. SPUs incorporating market interconnectedness enable management to establish directions for future growth and determine how expansion or retraction of the portfolio in a given direction impacts other portfolio units. Opportunities to leverage core competencies across portfolio units in international markets and to reconfigure portfolio units and operations so as to achieve greater synergies can also be identified.",0
On Improving the Conceptual Foundations of International Marketing Research,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"International marketing research plays a vital role as firms expand globally. Yet limited attention has been paid to the conceptual underpinnings of research needed to guide expansion. This article focuses on these issues and specifically examines the conceptual framework that guides research, the geographic units of analysis, and the constructs. The authors suggest two alternative approaches to organizing cross-cultural research: the adapted etic and the linked emic.",0
Collaborative and Iterative Translation: An Alternative Approach to Back Translation,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Back translation is the technique most commonly used to check the accuracy of translation in survey research. Although it results in a direct or literal translation, it does not address issues of conceptual equivalence. Furthermore, if it is not combined with pretesting, it does not address issues of comprehension and meaning to the respondent. This article discusses some of the problems of relying exclusively on back translation in isolation. It suggests the use of a collaborative, iterative approach for translating questionnaires for international marketing research.",0
Convergence and Divergence: Developing a Semiglobal Marketing Strategy,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Many markets are converging, as communications and logistic networks become more integrated and firms from all parts of the world are expanding operations on a global scale. At the same time, other markets are becoming more diverse, and marketers are increasingly encountering economic and cultural heterogeneity. The authors examine the implications of these trends and the extent to which they necessitate rethinking and refocusing global marketing strategy. First, they examine the perspective of global marketing strategy as an evolutionary process. Next, they divide markets into five major spheres, examining the economic and cultural diversity of markets in each. Next, they discuss the resultant need to develop and implement different strategies for markets in each of these spheres. Some conclusions are drawn relating to the difficulties involved in developing a coherent strategy in international markets. The authors advocate developing a semiglobal marketing strategy, which involves following different directions in different parts of the world, resulting in greater autonomy at the local level.",0
Executive Insights: Integrating Branding Strategy across Markets: Building International Brand Architecture,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Brands play a critical role in establishing a firm's visibility and position in international markets. Building a coherent international brand architecture is a key component of the firm's overall international marketing strategy, because it provides a structure to leverage strong brands into other markets, assimilate acquired brands, and integrate strategy across markets. The authors examine the way firms have developed international brand architecture and the drivers that shape the architecture. The authors discuss implications for the design and management of the firm's international brand architecture.",0
A Note on Psychological Distance and Export Market Selection,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"The concept of psychological distance, or psychic distance, was first proposed by Beckerman (1956) and later popularized by Johanson and Vahlne (1977). However, efforts to test the impact of psychological distance on export market selection have been sporadic and flawed. The author calibrates a single-item indicator of psychological distance using an independent panel of experts. The predictive ability of the resulting instrument is then tested on the order in which Australian exporters select their first five foreign markets. The author then compares this instrument with three other scales that are commonly employed as indicators of psychological distance. Scales based on Sethi's (1971) and Hofstede's (1980) work prove to be inferior predictors of early market selection. Geographic distance is found to be a significant predictor, but its effect is largely independent of psychological distance. The author also explores the dynamic nature of psychological distance. The impact of psychological distance on market selection appears to decrease substantially after the first market entry decision but remains a significant predictor.",0
The Adaptation of Host Market Positioning Strategies: Empirical Evidence on Australian Exporters,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The author explores how and why the content of an exporter's host market positioning strategy differs from the content of its home market strategy. The research is significant for two reasons: (1) It uses a more comprehensive and rigorous definition and measurement of firm strategy than previous adaptation research, and (2) it systematically measures the magnitude and direction of the adaptation. Previous research has concentrated only on the need to adapt. This approach opens up an entirely new debate about what patterns of adaptation should be expected. The author uses a large-scale survey of Australian exporters to test the emerging hypotheses, which are strongly supported. Domestically based Australian exporters tend to have a narrower focus and rely more heavily on operations-based differentiation in foreign markets.",0
Challenging the Conceptualization and Measurement of Distance and International Experience in Entry Mode Choice Research,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Although international entry mode choice has been extensively studied, the empirical results regarding two key antecedents?various forms of distance and international experience?have been equivocal. The authors argue that the conceptualization and measurement of these variables may be contributing to the ambiguous results. They demonstrate that a broader conceptualization of the underlying factors driving the distance construct substantially increases the ability to predict entry mode. Furthermore, when a refined interpretation of international experience is employed, only experience in similar countries affects entry mode selection. Experience in dissimilar countries seems to have no predictive power. These results call for a radical change in how these two key constructs should be operationalized in further entry mode research.",0
Internet versus Television Advertising: A Brand-Building Comparison,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Many advertisers are reluctant to shift a large proportion of their advertising budgets to the Internet because they still view television advertising as the main vehicle for building a brand. Using a unique and rich data set comprising 20 campaigns across a variety of industries, this study demonstrates that Internet ads perform on par with television ads on the brand-building metrics that advertisers use and trust. The authors extend traditional brand?message recall measurements to facilitate comparisons between Internet formats and television by supplementing brand?message surveys conducted during the campaign with a set of precampaign surveys to control for preexisting brand knowledge. They find that accounting for differences in preexisting brand knowledge is paramount in obtaining valid comparisons across advertising formats because people who are exposed to Internet display ads have significantly lower levels of preexisting brand knowledge than television viewers. Without considering the differences in these ?initial conditions,? television advertising seems to be more effective than advertising on the Internet, but when the preexisting differences among media formats are taken into account, the brand recall lift measures for Internet ads are statistically indistinguishable from comparable television lift measures.",1
Choice Set Heterogeneity and the Role of Advertising: An Analysis with Micro and Macro Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors show how to use microlevel survey data from a tracking study on brand awareness in conjunction with data on sales and advertising expenditures to improve the specification, estimation, and interpretation of aggregate discrete choice models of demand. In a departure from the commonly made full information assumption, they incorporate limited information in the form of choice sets to reflect that consumers may not be aware of all available brands at purchase time. They find that both the estimated brand constants and the price coefficient are biased downward when consumer heterogeneity in choice sets is ignored. These biased estimates can lead firms to make costly price-setting mistakes. In addition, the tracking data enable the authors to identify separately two processes by which advertising influences market shares. They find that advertising has a direct effect on brand awareness (inclusion in choice set) in addition to its effect on consumer preferences (increase in utility). This improved understanding of how advertising works enhances researchers? ability to make policy recommendations.",1
Using Combined-Currency Prices to Lower Consumers? Perceived Cost,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The increasing popularity of loyalty programs and related marketing promotions has resulted in the introduction of several new currencies (e.g., frequent flier miles, Diner's Club ?Club Rewards?) that consumers accumulate, budget, save, and spend much as they do traditional paper money. As consumers are increasingly able to pay for goods and services such as airline travel, hotel stays, and groceries in various combinations of currencies, an understanding of how shoppers respond to ?combined-currency pricing? is important for marketers. This research is the first to explore how consumers evaluate transactions that involve combined-currency prices, or prices issued in multiple currencies (e.g., $39 and 16,000 miles). The authors present a formal mathematical proof that outlines the conditions under which a price that comprises payments delivered in different currencies can be superior to a standard, single-currency price, either by lowering the psychological or perceived cost associated with a particular revenue objective (i.e., price) or by raising the amount of revenue collected given a particular perceived cost. Three studies, in which respondents evaluate and choose among prices issued in single and combined currencies, offer both experimental and empirical support.",1
Product Standardization and Attribute Saliency: A Three-Country Empirical Comparison,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Standardizing the marketing mix across different countries is limited by numerous factors. Focusing specifically on the scope for product standardization in the car industry, this paper empirically investigates the extent to which consumer preferences may act as barriers to standardization. Consumers from Korea, Spain and France?three countries at different stages of development and with distinct socio-cultural characteristics?are compared in terms of the importance they attach to various product attributes with particular emphasis on country-of-origin information and ?green ? features. The results reveal a large number of significant differences between the three subsamples and illustrate the substantial barriers to standardization that can exist even for such relatively culture-free products as cars.",0
Leveraging Trends in Online Searches for Product Features in Market Response Modeling,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.",0
Household Life Cycles and Lifestyles in the United States,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Household life cycle has been widely used as a determinant of consumer behavior and a basis for market segmentation. However, there is considerable disagreement about how life stages should be defined and how households progress through these stages. Existing studies use a priori definitions, which are tested on a cross-sectional survey of households collected at a single point in time and thus cannot reveal the real dynamics of the household life cycle. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have followed since 1968. They develop a hidden Markov model in which the stages of the household life cycle are taken as latent, unobservable states that are uncovered from the manifest household demographic profiles over the 34 years, assuming that households evolve through these latent stages following a first-order Markov process. The authors apply their results to classify members of another panel (Consumer Expenditure Survey) into life stages, which enables them to study the impact of the household life cycle on households' budgetary allocations, providing a comprehensive analysis of lifestyles (through expenditure patterns) over the household life cycle.",1
Where did all that Money Go? Understanding how Consumers Allocate their Consumption Budget,Journal of Marketing,2008,"All types of consumer expenditures ultimately vie for the same pool of limited resources?the consumer's discretionary income. Consequently, consumers? spending in a particular industry can be better understood in relation to their expenditures in others. Although marketers may believe that they are operating in distinct and unrelated industries, it is important to understand how consumers, with a given budget, make trade-offs between meeting different consumption needs. For example, how much would escalating gas prices affect consumer spending on food and apparel? Which industries would gain most in terms of extra consumer spending as a result of a tax rebate? Answers to these questions are also important from a public policy standpoint because they provide insights into how consumer welfare would be affected as consumers reallocate their consumption budget in response to environmental changes. This study proposes a structural demand model to approximate the household budget allocation decision, in which consumers are assumed to allocate a given budget across a full spectrum of consumption categories to maximize an underlying utility function. The authors illustrate the model using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the United States, covering 31 consumption categories over 22 years. The calibrated model makes it possible to draw direct inferences about the trade-offs individual households make when they face budget constraints and how their relative preferences for different consumption categories vary across life stages and income levels. The study also demonstrates how the proposed model can be used in policy simulations to quantify the potential impacts on consumption patterns due to shifts in prices or discretionary income.",0
Measuring Contagion in the Diffusion of Consumer Packaged Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This study measures the degree of contagion or interpersonal influence in the diffusion of new consumer packaged goods (CPGs). The authors demonstrate that when an individual-level trial hazard model is properly specified to account for potential sources of biases, substantial contagion effects may be detected in the diffusion of many CPGs. Using longitudinal panel data on individual-level trial and repeat purchases of 67 newly introduced CPGs, they show that standard diffusion models fail to detect contagion. However, after extending the model to allow for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in contagion and controlling for various cross-sectional and temporal confounds, they find statistically significant contagion effects in 33 to 40 of the 67 sample products. The empirical evidence of contagion in the diffusion of many CPGs has important implications because most new product trial models for CPGs have assumed a priori that there is no contagion in the diffusion of these products. Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into the unobservable network of influences among consumers. Such analysis allows a vendor to identify the most influential early adopters among its customers, who could help diffuse a new product more effectively in the market.",1
Quantitative Trendspotting,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Trendspotting has become an important marketing intelligence tool for identifying and tracking general tendencies in consumer interest and behavior. Currently, trendspotting is done either qualitatively by trend hunters, who comb through everyday life in search of signs indicating major shifts in consumer needs and wants, or quantitatively by analysts, who monitor individual indicators, such as how many times a keyword has been searched, blogged, or tweeted online. In this study, the authors demonstrate how the latter can be improved by uncovering common trajectories hidden behind the coevolution of a large array of indicators. The authors propose a structural dynamic factor-analytic model that can be applied for simultaneously analyzing tens or even hundreds of time series, distilling them into a few key latent dynamic factors that isolate seasonal cyclic movements from nonseasonal, nonstationary trend lines. The authors demonstrate this novel multivariate approach to quantitative trendspotting in one application involving a promising new source of marketing intelligence?online keyword search data from Google Insights for Search?in which they analyze search volume patterns across 38 major makes of light vehicles over an 81-month period to uncover key common trends in consumer vehicle shopping interest.",1
Size and Share of Customer Wallet,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Many companies collect substantial information about their interactions with their customers. Yet information about their customers' transactions with competing firms is often sparse or nonexistent. As a result, firms are often compelled to manage customer relationships from an inward view of their customers. However, the empirical analysis in this study indicates that (1) the volume of customers' transactions within a firm has little correlation with the volume of their transactions with the firm's competitors and (2) a small percentage of customers account for a large portion of all the external transactions, suggesting the considerable potential to increase sales if these customers can be correctly identified and incentivized to switch. Thus, the authors argue for a more outward view in customer relationship management and develop a list augmentation?based approach to augment firms' internal records with insights into their customers' relationships with competing firms, including the size of each customer's wallet and the firm's share of it.",0
Capturing Marketing Information to Fuel Growth,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Marketing is the functional area primarily responsible for driving the organic growth of a firm. In the age of digital marketing and big data, marketers are inundated with increasingly rich data from an ever-expanding array of sources. Such data may help marketers generate insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made ?capturing information to fuel growth? a top research priority. The authors begin by discussing the streetlight effect?an overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application?as contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention. The authors highlight challenges that obstruct firms from realizing such data-driven growth opportunities and how future research may help overcome those challenges.",0
Immediate Responses of Online Brand Search and Price Search to TV Ads,Journal of Marketing,2019,"This study aims to deepen the understanding of evaluating TV ad spots by their immediate effects on important online activities. The authors merged minute-by-minute brand search and price search data with spot-level TV advertisement data for the three leading pickup truck brands in the United States over an 11-month period. They presented a generalizable modeling framework and used it to estimate the size and variation of immediate online responses to TV ads. The average elasticity of brand search to a brand?s own national ads is .09, and the average elasticity of price search to a brand?s own national ads is .03. Given ad audience size, immediate search responses vary with ad creative characteristics, audience category interest, slot of the break, program genre, and time factors. Overall, the results show that ordinary TV ads lead to a variety of immediate online responses and that advertisers can use these signals to enrich their media planning and campaign evaluations.",0
The Role of Spatial Demand on Outlet Location and Pricing,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"In this article, the authors consider the problem of outlet pricing and location in the context of unobserved spatial demand. The analysis constitutes a scenario in which capacity-constrained firms set prices conditional on their location, demand, and costs. This enables firms to develop maps of latent demand patterns across the market in which they compete. The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95% spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability by 66% over a model that ignores these effects.",1
Do Switching Costs Make Markets Less Competitive?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The conventional wisdom in economic theory holds that switching costs make markets less competitive. This article challenges this claim. The authors formulate an empirically realistic model of dynamic price competition that allows for differentiated products and imperfect lock-in. They calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased packaged goods markets. These data are ideal in the sense that they have the necessary variation to identify switching costs separately from consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes the results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching costs. More important, equilibrium prices do not increase even in the presence of switching costs that are of the same order of magnitude as product price.",1
Executive Insights: The Super Sales Force?Politicians in the World Market,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Exporting has become a popular means for businesses to augment sales and profitability and for countries to improve their gross domestic product and balance of trade. As a complement to export selling, high-level government officials increasingly are providing export promotional assistance to their nations? industries. Much of what is known about this ?high-level government selling, ? however, is based on conventional wisdom and anecdotal evidence. This article reports the results of a study that examined non-U.S. politicians? export selling efforts. Data were obtained from surveys of foreign embassy diplomats in the United States. Findings offer insights into what government officials are doing to stimulate sales of their countries? exports.",0
Sharing with Friends versus Strangers: How Interpersonal Closeness Influences Word-of-Mouth Valence,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"How does interpersonal closeness (IC)?the perceived psychological proximity between a sender and a recipient?influence word-of-mouth (WOM) valence? The current research proposes that high levels of IC tend to increase the negativity of WOM shared, whereas low levels of IC tend to increase the positivity of WOM shared. The authors hypothesize that this effect is due to low versus high levels of IC triggering distinct psychological motives. Low IC activates the motive to self-enhance, and communicating positive information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating negative information. In contrast, high IC activates the motive to protect others, and communicating negative information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating positive information. Four experiments provide evidence for the basic effect and the underlying role of consumers? motives to self-enhance and protect others through mediation and moderation. The authors discuss implications for understanding how WOM spreads across strongly versus weakly tied social networks.",1
"From Rumors to Facts, and Facts to Rumors: The Role of Certainty Decay in Consumer Communications",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"How does a rumor come to be believed as a fact as it spreads across a chain of consumers? This research proposes that because consumers? certainty about their beliefs (e.g., attitudes, opinions) is less salient than the beliefs themselves, certainty information is more susceptible to being lost in communication. Consistent with this idea, the current studies reveal that though consumers transmit their core beliefs when they communicate with one another, they often fail to transmit their certainty or uncertainty about those beliefs. Thus, a belief originally associated with high uncertainty (certainty) tends to lose this uncertainty (certainty) across communications. The authors demonstrate that increasing the salience of consumers? uncertainty/certainty when communicating or receiving information can improve uncertainty/certainty communication, and they investigate the consequences for rumor management and word-of-mouth communications.",1
Understanding the Impact of In-Process Promotional Messages: An Application to Online Auctions,Journal of Marketing,2016,"In-process promotions focus on promotional activities during marketing events such as auctions, crowdfunding, or fund-raising. Firms can observe consumers? responses to these promotions and use this information to adjust future promotions sent during the same events. The authors study the impact of promotions on market outcomes and focus on one use of such promotions: messages sent during online auctions, in which the outcome is the final auction price. They propose that the effect of these messages can be understood by observing their aggregate impact on final auction prices and by examining how messages affect behaviors at the bid level, namely, new-bidder entry and jump bidding. These bid-level behaviors can, when summed at the auction level, affect auction prices. Besides examining the messages? impact on bidder behavior, the authors study the auctioneer's strategy in issuing these messages. They distinguish between informative messages, which focus on product attributes, and persuasive messages, which try to motivate the message recipients to bid. They test hypotheses derived from their framework using data from online auctions of Air France airline tickets. The authors also conduct ?what-if? simulations to help auctioneers identify the optimal number of messages to send during an auction.",0
"Guilt versus Shame: Coping, Fluency, and Framing in the Effectiveness of Responsible Drinking Messages",Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This article presents three studies on how the negative emotions of guilt and shame differentially influence the effectiveness of health messages framed as gains or losses. Guilt appeals are more effective when paired with gain frames, whereas shame appeals are more effective when paired with loss frames. These framing effects occur because gain frames facilitate the use of problem-focused coping strategies favored by guilt, whereas loss frames facilitate the use of emotion-focused coping strategies favored by shame. Frames that fit with the emotion facilitate the activation of coping strategies consistent with that emotion and consequently lead to greater fluency and message effectiveness. These effects manifest on intentions to binge drink and time spent viewing alcohol advertising.",1
Channel Bargaining with Retailer Asymmetry,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Manufacturers of consumer products often complain of lower profits in light of the growing channel dominance of retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and other ?power retailers.? The authors argue that this complaint might not be valid. In an analytical model of competing manufacturers and competing multiproduct retailers, the authors show that manufacturers may actually experience increased profits when a retailer gains an exogenous cost advantage over its rival retailer. Potential channel efficiencies exist when retailing costs are reduced. The authors illustrate that channel transactions based on bilateral bargaining capture these efficiencies by transferring market share to the more efficient retailer, thus increasing channel profits. In a bargaining relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer, the manufacturer realizes some of these enhanced efficiencies. The authors discuss the managerial implications for pricing in channels.",1
Self-Threat and Product Failure: How Internal Attributions of Blame Affect Consumer Complaining Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Previous research in complaining behavior has focused on product or service failures in which the organization is responsible for the failure. In these cases, researchers have found that consumers feel better about the product failure after complaining about it. In contrast, the authors show that when consumers are to blame for product failure, complaining has a detrimental effect on consumer reactions to the product. In this context, self-threat from the product failure is shown to motivate defensive processing in both the content of complaints and the subsequent downstream product evaluations. The authors establish the role of self-threat in product failure in two ways: (1) by varying the intensity of the threat from product failure and (2) through mitigating negative outcomes through self-affirmation. The article concludes with discussion on how these findings can benefit companies and where this research could seed opportunities for subsequent investigation.",1
Psychic Distance and Country Image in Exporter?Importer Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Conflicting evidence on the issue of psychic distance (PD) in international business relationships has suggested the existence of misunderstood boundary conditions to its effect. This article argues that country image (CI) is a contingent factor to the effect of PD. Expectancy?value theory provides the theoretical foundations, and structural equation modeling analyses for a sample of 358 exporter?importer relationships in the global wine industry provide empirical support for this argument. Product-related CI mitigates the negative impact of PD on the relational exchange orientation (REO) between firms. Specifically, a high level of PD dampens REO when product-related CI is poor, whereas a strong product-related CI helps firms facing such PD conditions to build REO. People-related CI has an indirect effect on REO through product-related CI. This study helps explain the ?paradox of distance? and offers a fresh perspective on how to handle the issue of PD when relevant.",0
"Money, Status, and the Ovulatory Cycle",Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Each month, millions of women experience an ovulatory cycle that regulates fertility. Previous consumer research has found that this cycle influences women's clothing and food preferences. The authors propose that the ovulatory cycle actually has a much broader effect on women's economic behavior. Drawing on theory in evolutionary psychology, the authors hypothesize that the week-long period near ovulation should boost women's desire for relative status, which should alter their economic decisions. Findings from three studies show that women near ovulation seek positional goods to improve their social standing. Additional findings reveal that ovulation leads women to pursue positional goods when doing so improves relative standing compared with other women but not compared with men. When playing the dictator game, for example, ovulating women gave smaller offers to a female partner but not to a male partner. Overall, women's monthly hormonal fluctuations seem to have a substantial effect on consumer behavior by systematically altering their positional concerns, a finding that has important implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers.",1
The Effect of Stress on Consumer Saving and Spending,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"In examining how stress influences consumer saving and spending, the authors propose that consumers who experience a stressful situation allocate their resources strategically to gain control of their environment. A series of studies shows that this strategic allocation of resources occurs in two ways. Consumers experiencing stress may show increased saving behavior, which assures them that monetary resources will be available when needed. Alternatively, consumers experiencing stress may show increased spending behavior, directed specifically toward products that the consumer perceives to be necessities and that allow for control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. This conceptualization and the related findings can inform assessments of when stress will lead to beneficial or impulsive consumer behaviors.",1
Regret from Postpurchase Discovery of Lower Market Prices: Do Price Refunds Help?,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Consumer regret can result in unfavorable outcomes for marketers. To prevent regret, many retailers promise to refund money to consumers who discover lower prices after purchase. The authors show that a refund's effect on felt regret depends on how consumers view these promises. If consumers mainly view them as protective tools (i.e., adopt a protection focus), postrefund regret is minimal. If consumers primarily view such promises as sources of information about the retailer's price status (i.e., adopt an information focus), regret persists even after refund. The authors show that regret persists with these consumers because finding a lower price results in a perception of trust violation. They find that subject to boundary conditions, using a disclaimer that states that the retailer does not claim to offer the lowest prices helps avoid this negative outcome for information-focused consumers. The authors contribute to the literature on outcome reversibility and regret by showing that outcome reversal does not necessarily obviate regret. In addition, they show that regulatory focus serves as the motivational basis for how consumers view refund promises.",0
An Exploratory Examination of the Influence of National Culture on Cross-National Product Diffusion,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"This study examines the direct influence of national culture on the cross-national diffusion of innovations. Focusing on seven technological innovations across 13 European countries, the authors use Hofstede's multidimensional approach to culture to investigate this relationship. They find support linking four cultural dimensions?individualism, masculinity, power distance, and long-term orientation?to cross-national product diffusion. The findings suggest that national culture explains a relatively sizable amount of variation in cross-national diffusion rates. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of these results, including prescriptive guidance with respect to product launch strategy and tactics.",0
Local Branding in a Foreign Product Category in an Emerging Market,Journal of International Marketing,2005,It is unclear how local brands competing in product categories that consumers perceive as foreign should be managed in emerging markets. An interpretive research approach investigating consumer perceptions and managerial development of a local pizza brand in India reveals that consumers experience these brands as foreign. The author discusses implications for brand management.,0
Marketing in the Sharing Economy,Journal of Marketing,2019,"The last decade has seen the emergence of the sharing economy as well as the rise of a diverse array of research on this topic both inside and outside the marketing discipline. However, the sharing economy?s implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy?s impact on marketing?s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy?s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.",0
"Cultural Paradoxes Reflected in Brand Meaning: McDonald's in Shanghai, China",Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Brands are powerful symbols that reflect not only the image with which marketers hope to imbue them but also the cultural milieu in which they are imbedded. If that milieu is in a state of flux, brands can come to represent some surprising ideas and values to which marketing efforts must be sensitive. In this research, the authors relate the nature of societal change, a common occurrence in many developing markets and especially China, to evaluation of a brand by a broad cross-section of urban Chinese consumers. Using the methodology of scenario completion, the authors reveal that the McDonald's brand is evaluated in the context of societal norms and values that are brought up in various usage situations. Brand evaluations can be inconsistent and often paradoxical depending on the context. The results suggest that marketers should be closely involved with the way their brand is interacting with cultural values in transitional markets.",0
Marketing's Impact on Firm Value: Generalizations from a Meta-Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The interest in the value relevance of marketing investments has given rise to numerous studies on the marketing?finance interface. This study integrates extant research findings and establishes empirical generalizations on marketing's impact on firm value. Specifically, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of prior econometric elasticity estimates of the stock market impact of marketing actions and marketing assets. Analyses based on 488 elasticities drawn from 83 studies reveal a mean elasticity of .04 for advertising expenditure variables and of .54 for marketing asset variables. Among marketing assets, customer-related assets show a higher mean elasticity of .72, compared with .33 for brand-related assets. Further analyses show that advertising elasticities are lower in more concentrated industries and that marketing asset elasticities are higher during recession times. Researchers should also be aware that characteristics of the research design (e.g., the type of firm value metric used, the omission of control variables, or not accounting for endogeneity) may affect the estimation results.",1
When Does Market Share Matter? New Empirical Generalizations from a Meta-Analysis of the Market Share?Performance Relationship,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The impact of market share on financial firm performance is one of the most widely studied relationships in marketing strategy research. However, since the meta-analysis by Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and Varadarajan (1993), substantial environmental (e.g., digitization) and methodological (e.g., accounting for endogeneity) developments have occurred. The current work presents an updated and extended meta-analysis based on all available 863 elasticities drawn from 89 studies and provides the following new empirical generalizations: (1) The average raw market share?financial performance elasticity is .132, which is substantially lower than the effectiveness of other intermediate marketing metrics. This result challenges a widely used strategy that solely focuses on increasing market share. (2) Elasticities differ significantly between contextual settings. For example, they are lower for business-to-business firms than for business-to-consumer firms, for service firms than for manufacturing firms, and for U.S. markets than for emerging and Western European markets. The authors also observe differences between countries with respect to a general time trend (e.g., lower elasticities in recent times for Western European markets) and recessionary periods (e.g., lower elasticities in the United States, higher elasticities in non-Western economies).",0
"Risk, Information, and Incentives in Online Affiliate Marketing",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors examine online affiliate marketing programs in which merchants oversee thousands of affiliates they have never met. Some merchants hire outside specialists to set and enforce policies for affiliates, whereas other merchants ask their marketing staff to perform these functions. For clear violations of applicable rules, the authors find that outside specialists are the most effective at excluding the responsible affiliates, which can be interpreted as a benefit of specialization. However, in-house staff are more successful at identifying and excluding affiliates whose practices are viewed as ?borderline? (albeit still contrary to merchants? interests), forgoing the efficiencies of specialization in favor of the better incentives of a company's staff. The authors consider the implications for marketing of online affiliate programs and for online marketing more generally.",1
Design of Search Engine Services: Channel Interdependence in Search Engine Results,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors examine prominent placement of search engines? own services and effects on users? choices. Evaluating a natural experiment in which different results were shown to users who performed similar searches, they find that Google's prominent placement of its Flight Search service increased the clicks on paid advertising listings by more than half while decreasing the clicks on organic search listings by about the same quantity. This effect appears to result from interactions between the design of search results and users? decisions about where and how to focus their attention: users who decide what to click on the basis of relevance were more likely to select paid listings, whereas users who are influenced by visual presentation and page position were more likely to click on Google's own Flight Search listing. The authors consider implications of these findings for competition policy and for online marketing strategies.",1
Multivariate Analysis of Multiple Response Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Multiple response questions, also known as a pick any/J format, are frequently encountered in the analysis of survey data. The relationship among the responses is difficult to explore when the number of response options, J, is large. The authors propose a multivariate binomial probit model for analyzing multiple response data and use standard multivariate analysis techniques to conduct exploratory analysis on the latent multivariate normal distribution. A challenge of estimating the probit model is addressing identifying restrictions that lead to the covariance matrix specified with unit-diagonal elements (i.e., a correlation matrix). The authors propose a general approach to handling identifying restrictions and develop specific algorithms for the multivariate binomial probit model. The estimation algorithm is efficient and can easily accommodate many response options that are frequently encountered in the analysis of marketing data. The authors illustrate multivariate analysis of multiple response data in three applications.",1
Gift Purchases as Catalysts for Strengthening Customer?Brand Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Gift giving is an effective means to strengthen interpersonal relationships; it also may initiate and enhance customer?brand relationships. Through a field study conducted with an international monobrand retailer of beauty products, a combination of propensity score matching with difference-in-differences estimations, and two experimental scenario studies, this research demonstrates that gift buyers spend 63% more in the year following a gift purchase than a matched sample of customers who purchase for their personal use. Specifically, gift buyers increase their purchase frequency (25%), spend more per shopping trip (41%), and engage in more cross-buying (49%). The sales lift is particularly pronounced among new customers. Identity theory suggests customer gratitude and public commitment as mediating mechanisms. Gift purchase design characteristics (i.e., assistance during gift purchase and branded gift wrapping) influence the strength of the mediating mechanisms.",0
Willful Ignorance in the Request for Product Attribute Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Attribute information is not always readily available to consumers. This is especially true for ethical attributes, such as labor practices, environmental friendliness, and so forth. Intuitively, it might be expected that consumers who would use an attribute in their decision making should seek attribute information, especially if it is easily obtainable. In three studies, the authors measure discrepancies between requests for available ethical attribute information and actual use of the same attribute in a conjoint task. In both between-subjects and within-subjects designs, the authors show that consumers (1) underrequest ethical attribute information and (2) are especially likely to show request/use inconsistency if they care about the underlying ethical issue. Negative emotions, especially the avoidance of anger, appear to drive this willful ignorance. These results add to the growing literature on avoidance mechanisms and consumer decision making and may shed light on when ethical attributes do (and do not) play a role in actual purchase behavior.",1
Making Business-to-Business International Internet Marketing Effective: A Study of Critical Factors Using a Case-Study Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The recent phenomenal growth in business activities dependent on the Internet has demonstrated that various potential advantages could be derived from using information and communication technology platforms. The Internet has enabled firms to reach out to global markets and has provided them with the opportunity to customize their strategies and offerings in an unprecedented way. These recent developments provide an exciting opportunity for research to study the dynamics involved in international Internet marketing (IIM) and, in particular, to examine closely the factors that could influence success in using this new technology for IIM activities. Using a business-to-business context and a multiple-case-study approach, this article focuses on two main areas of study: (1) the critical examination of the literature and identification of the most important factors that have a significant influence on business-to-business IIM and (2) the first-hand verification of how the identified factors are implemented in various organizational contexts.",0
Does it Pay to Recall your Product Early? An Empirical Investigation in the Automobile Industry,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Defective products are often recalled to limit harm to consumers and damage to the firm. However, little is known about why the timing of product recalls varies after an investigation is opened. Likewise, there is little evidence on whether recall timing affects stock markets. This study tests the effect of problem severity on time to recall, the role of brand characteristics in moderating this relationship, and the stock market impact of time to recall. The authors test the hypotheses on a sample of 381 recall investigations in the automobile industry between 1999 and 2012. The results show that although problem severity increases time to recall, this relationship is weaker when the brand under investigation (1) has a strong reputation for reliability and (2) has experienced severe recalls in the recent past. However, the relationship between problem severity and time to recall is stronger when the brand is diverse. Importantly, the results reveal that stock markets punish recall delays. The study suggests that time to recall has significant implications for managers and policy makers.",0
Have We Progressed Marketing Knowledge? A Meta-Meta-Analysis of Effect Sizes in Marketing Research,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This study measures the value and progress of knowledge produced in marketing research by using meta-analytic effect sizes as a measure of scientific knowledge. The author combines the results of 176 meta-analyses that include data from more than 7,500 primary studies published between 1918 and 2012. The 1,841 meta-analytic effect sizes show that a considerable body of marketing knowledge has been developed, as expressed by a meta-meta-analytic correlation of .24. This medium-sized effect is as strong or stronger than effects that have been found in compilations of meta-analyses in other, more basic fields of inquiry (e.g., psychology), which shows that marketing is a successful academic discipline. The effect sizes vary across subject areas, with pricing showing the strongest effects, followed by consumer behavior; methods and new product development show the weakest effects. This finding reveals different degrees of knowledge production and varying benchmarks to assess the contribution of future research outcomes in these subject areas. Marketing knowledge follows a discontinuous model of progress: knowledge has increased over time, but at a decreasing rate; the marketing field, which is currently characterized by fragmentation and specialization, has reached a stage of maturity. The findings provide implications for further research regarding how to measure, evaluate, and progress knowledge in marketing.",0
The Relative Advantage of Marketing over Technological Capabilities in Influencing New Product Performance: The Moderating Role of Country Institutions,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Marketing and technological capabilities are major drivers of new product performance. Prior research has suggested that marketing capabilities outperform technological capabilities. This study shows that the relative advantage of marketing over technological capabilities for new product performance depends on the institutional context in a country. Meta-analytic data of 341 effect sizes of the relationship between capabilities and new product performance taken from 50 articles with 57 independent samples and collected in 17 different countries reveal new contingencies to the capabilities framework. Although in general, marketing capabilities have a stronger influence than technological capabilities on new product performance, this effect is moderated by institutional context factors. The relative advantage decreases and even reverses with increasing growth rates; it further decreases with increasingly stronger rules of law in a country; and it increases in societies that put emphasis on self-expression values over survival values. These findings contribute to research on the utility of different capabilities, inform the institution-based view of firms in international marketing, and provide implications for international marketing managers.",0
Who Buys Counterfeit Luxury Brands? A Meta-Analytic Synthesis of Consumers in Developing and Developed Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Although numerous previous studies have investigated consumer demographics and psychographics as determinants of counterfeit purchases, their findings are diverse and fragmented. In conceptually referring to the brand signals that help consumers build their identities, the present meta-analysis synthesizes the influence of consumer demographics and psychographics on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors with regard to branded counterfeit luxury products. It empirically summarizes 610 effect sizes from 98 independent studies and shows that whereas demographics have little impact, some psychographics greatly influence counterfeit purchases, with these influences differing between developed and developing countries. In the former, risk propensity and reduced integrity are stronger determinants of counterfeit purchases and are related to brand signals that refer to identities that consumers attempt to avoid. In developing countries, consumers are more influenced by psychographics, such as status seeking, which are related to positive brand signals for consumer identities. The findings lead to a profile of consumers of counterfeit luxury items that provides guidance for future research and for improved consumer targeting with regard to international anticounterfeiting measures.",0
Action-Based Learning: Goals and Attention in the Acquisition of Market Knowledge,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this article, the authors examine the costs and benefits of action-based learning (i.e., learning that occurs as a by-product of making repeated decisions with outcome feedback). The authors report the results of three experiments that investigate the effects of different decision goals on what is learned and how transferable that learning is across related decision tasks. Contrary to popular wisdom, compared with traditional learning, experiential learning is likely to be a risky proposition because it can be either accurate and efficient or errorful and biased.",1
Drivers of Brand Commitment: A Cross-National Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Firms increasingly employ global brand management strategies for the effective coordination of their global activities. Effective coordination requires adapting global brand management strategies to cultural nuances. This study examines the influence of culture on the impact of four key brand management elements (i.e., brand innovativeness, brand customer orientation, brand self-relevance, and social responsibility) on customer commitment to a brand. Using responses from 167 U.K. and 230 Chinese consumers, the authors empirically demonstrate that brand innovativeness and brand self-relevance have a greater effect on brand commitment in cultures that are individualist, short-term oriented, and low on power distance (i.e., the United Kingdom), while brand customer orientation and social responsibility have a greater impact on brand commitment in cultures that are collectivist, long-term oriented, and high on power distance (i.e., China). Furthermore, the findings reveal that in collectivist, long-term-oriented, and high-power-distance cultures, the four brand management activities equally contribute to brand commitment. The research informs global brand managers wanting to optimize brand positioning and strengthen customers? brand commitment across cultures.",0
The Impact of E-Commerce on Entry-Mode Strategies of Service Firms: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This article focuses on the role of e-commerce on the entry-mode choice of service firms. On the basis of recent calls for the reconceptualization of marketing theories and concepts with services as a key component, the authors focus on the interface of e-commerce, services marketing, and foreign market entry-mode choice. The authors offer an integrative conceptual framework that explicates the role of e-commerce on the entry-mode choice of service firms, and they propose that several internal and external factors moderate this relationship. The authors derive several research propositions and offer managerial implications and directions for further research in the timely and exciting domain of services marketing.",0
The Power of Stars: Do Star Actors Drive the Success of Movies?,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Is the involvement of stars critical to the success of motion pictures? Film studios, which regularly pay multimillion-dollar fees to stars, seem to be driven by that belief. This article sheds light on the returns on this investment using an event study that considers the impact of more than 1200 casting announcements on trading behavior in a simulated and real stock market setting. The author finds evidence that the involvement of stars affects movies' expected theatrical revenues and provides insight into the magnitude of this effect. For example, the estimates suggest that, on average, stars are worth approximately $3 million in theatrical revenues. In a cross-sectional analysis grounded in the literature on group dynamics, the author also examines the determinants of the magnitude of stars' impact on expected revenues. Among other things, the author shows that the stronger a cast already is, the greater is the impact of a newly recruited star with a track record of box office successes or with a strong artistic reputation. Finally, in an extension to the study, the author does not find that the involvement of stars in movies increases the valuation of film companies that release the movies, thus providing insufficient grounds to conclude that stars add more value than they capture. The author discusses implications for managers in the motion picture industry.",0
Bye-Bye Bundles: The Unbundling of Music in Digital Channels,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Fueled by digital distribution, unbundling is prevalent in many information and entertainment industries. What is the effect of this unbundling on sales, and what bundle characteristics drive this effect? The author empirically examines these questions in the context of the music industry, using data on weekly digital-track, digital-album, and physical-album sales from January 2005 to April 2007 for all titles released by a sample of more than 200 artists. The modeling framework, a system of an ?album-sales? and a ?song-sales? equation estimated with the seemingly unrelated regression method, explicitly accounts for the interaction between sales for the bundle and its components. The findings reveal that revenues decrease significantly as digital downloading becomes more prevalent, but the number of items included in a bundle (a measure of its ?objective? value) is not a significant moderator of this effect. Instead, bundles with items that are more equal in their appeal and bundles offered by producers with a strong reputation suffer less from the negative impact of the shift to mixed bundling in online channels.",0
Executive Insights: The Russian Aerospace Industry?Survey with Implications for American Firms in the Global Marketplace,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article highlights the factors that have made the global expansion of Russian aerospace enterprises possible and the importance of ?relational networks? as key strategic assets of these companies. Russian aerospace organizations appear to have developed some distinct core competencies, such as state-of-the-art technology, capacity to manufacture high-performance products and systems at relatively low costs, and pragmatic management. These companies also pursue strategies leading to the use of a variety of different types of international strategic partnerships, including joint ventures, joint R&D agreements, co-production agreements, co-marketing alliances, and cross-licensing agreements.The article concludes with a section on the implications for American companies in the global marketplace. It is argued that international networking, technology sharing, co-marketing, cross-licensing, and the other forms of international strategic partnerships represent an important change in the ways that companies do business. These arrangements necessitate a different approach to corporate management and organization. The potential advantages of value-driven superstructures, cross-functional teams, cross-organizational task forces, and improved understanding of foreign cultures have been specified.",0
Product Launches with New Attributes: A Hybrid Conjoint?Consumer Panel Technique for Estimating Demand,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors propose and empirically evaluate a new hybrid estimation approach that integrates choice-based conjoint with repeated purchase data for a dense consumer panel, and they show that it increases the accuracy of conjoint predictions for actual purchases observed months later. The key innovation lies in combining conjoint data with a long and detailed panel of actual choices for a random sample of the target population. By linking the actual purchase and conjoint data, researchers can estimate preferences for attributes not yet present in the marketplace, while also addressing many of the key limitations of conjoint analysis, including sample selection and contextual differences. Counterfactual product and pricing exercises illustrate the managerial relevance of the approach.",1
Repositioning Dynamics and Pricing Strategy,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors measure the revenue and cost implications to supermarkets of changing their price positioning strategy in oligopolistic downstream retail markets. Their approach formally incorporates the dynamics induced by the repositioning in a model with strategic interaction. They exploit a unique data set containing the price format decisions of all U.S. supermarkets in the 1990s. The data contain the format change decisions of supermarkets in response to a large shock to their local market positions: the entry of Wal-Mart. The authors exploit the responses of retailers to Wal-Mart entry to infer the cost of changing pricing formats using a revealed-preference argument. The interaction between retailers and Wal-Mart in each market is modeled as a dynamic game. The authors find evidence that entry by Wal-Mart had a significant impact on the costs and incidence of switching pricing strategy. Their results add to the marketing literature on the organization of retail markets and have implications for long-term market structure in the supermarket industry. Their approach, which incorporates long-term dynamic consequences, strategic interaction, and sunk investment costs, may be used to empirically model firms? positioning decisions in marketing more generally.",1
Consumer Perception of Product Quality and the Country-of-Origin Effect1,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Consumer attitudes to local and foreign products and the likely ?country-of-origin? effect in ?Buy Local? and ?Made In ?? campaigns are surveyed. First, the importance of country of origin in relation to other product attributes is considered. Second, country of origin is assessed as a surrogate indicator of product quality. Third, the likely effect of country of origin on consumer choice across a range of product categories is studied with brand name and price held constant.Across the product categories studied, respondents rated country of origin as significantly less important as a choice determinant than product quality and price. In addition, clear country-of-origin effects are identified. Consumers rate products as being of significantly different quality when the only variation between products is stated country of origin. Further, consumers express a marked preference for locally made products when price, technical features, and brand name are invariant, and where the locally made product is perceived to be superior or, at least, not significantly inferior to an overseas-made product. Where the locally made product is perceived to be of inferior quality to the imported product, consumers generally prefer an imported product.Thus, while consumers rate country of origin after product quality and price, when these other factors are equivalent, the fact that the product is promoted as locally made is a positive influence on product choice.",0
Are International Trade Intermediaries Catalysts in Economic Development? A New Research Agenda,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"International trade intermediaries (ITIs) represent a valuable conduit for market information and marketing technology for the international neophyte firm. However, aware that their intermediary role can become redundant over time, ITIs may adopt survival strategies that are suboptimal from the manufacturer's point of view. This article identifies the catalytic and sometimes ambiguous role of ITIs in the economic development of host nations. The author identifies some propositions and proposes a research agenda.",0
Social Factors Influencing Export Initiation in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,The authors examine the influence of antecedent social ties on export behavior in an exploratory cross-case investigation of a sample of small and medium-sized exporters drawn from different industries. Data pertaining to 31 export market entries support the view that decision makers' cosmopolitanism has a significant influence on the initiation of exports.,1
Why Do Consumers Stop Viewing Television Commercials? Two Experiments on the Influence of Moment-to-Moment Entertainment and Information Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,This research demonstrates the positive effects of moment-to-moment entertainment and the negative effects of moment-to-moment information value on consumers' likelihood to continue watching during a television commercial. A notable finding is that both the entertainment and the information value have a strong multiplicative effect on the probability to stop viewing.,1
Thin Slice Impressions: How Advertising Evaluation Depends on Exposure Duration,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This research demonstrates the importance of thin slices of information in ad and brand evaluation, with important implications for advertising research and management. Three controlled experiments, two in the behavioral lab and one in the field, with exposure durations ranging from very brief (100 msec) to very long (30 sec), demonstrate that advertising evaluation critically depends on the duration of ad exposure and on how ads convey which product and brand they promote, but in surprising ways. The experiments show that upfront ads, which instantly convey what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief but also after longer exposure durations. Mystery ads, which suspend conveying what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively after longer exposure durations. False front ads, which initially convey another identity than what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief exposures but negatively after longer exposure durations. Bayesian mediation analysis demonstrates that the feeling of knowing what the ad promotes accounts for these ad-type effects on evaluation.",1
A Cross-Cultural Perspective of Marketing Departments? Influence Tactics,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Recent marketing literature has shown that an influential marketing department is a driver of an organizationwide market orientation and, in some studies, of firm performance. Recognizing the importance of a strong marketing department, this study develops a theoretical model of the levers of marketing departments? influence and examines the degree to which the effects of the levers are subject to national cultural variations. The authors empirically validate the theoretical model using 740 firms from six Western and Asian countries. The findings reveal both culturally dependent and independent effects. For example, although a great degree of innovativeness in the marketing department has a positive impact on the department's influence across cultures, a high level of accountability and integration with other departments shows cultural dependencies. Global marketing managers learn whether they should advise their local marketing department to use standardized influence tactics or make necessary adaptations to local circumstances.",0
How can chief Marketing Officers Strengthen their Influence? A Social Capital Perspective across Six Country Groups,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"This article examines the effect of the chief marketing officer's (CMO) social capital along the dimensions of utilization of managerial ties, trust, and solidarity on his or her influence in the top management team (TMT) in a multicultural context. The study uses primary survey data from 412 CMOs across six country groups (Australia and New Zealand; Austria; Germany; China, including Hong Kong; Singapore; and the United States) to investigate the moderating effects of national culture on the relationship between social capital and the influence of CMOs in the TMT. The findings show that the social capital dimensions of managerial tie utilization and trust are strong drivers of a CMO's influence in the TMT and that these relationships are culturally dependent. Trust tends to be more effective when the national cultural dimensions of collectivism and uncertainty avoidance are high, and solidarity in the CMO's network relationship increases his or her influence only in collectivistic cultures.",0
Designing Solutions around Customer Network Identity Goals,Journal of Marketing,2011,"When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms? solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints. The authors conclude with recommendations for how firms can use this information to improve solution design, identify new network partners, and revise value propositions.",0
The Role of Brands and Mediating Technologies in Assembling Long-Distance Family Practices,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Increasingly, circumstances such as divorce, employment commuting, and military service have resulted in the geographic dispersion of family networks, and this reality holds both risks and opportunities for brands, products, and services embedded in family life. The authors leverage a longitudinal design including group interviews (initial/follow-up) and participant diaries to track how families? consumption practices shift in response to separation, morphing across time and place to retain and strengthen family bonds. Their findings generate a framework that explains how and when colocated consumption practices reassemble through technologies across distances. The framework considers practice dimensions, separation type, motivation, potential/realized capacities, and mobilized technologies to forecast potential practice trajectories under conditions of extended separation. Five potential trajectories emerge: no trial, heroic quests, failed trial, easy translations, and sacred pieces. The authors? discussion of managerial implications provides suggestions to enable companies to anticipate trajectories and take action to enhance brand use and loyalty to ensure that their brands survive reassembly within existing family practices or become integral to new family practices that feature the brand.",0
Understanding Reference-Price Shoppers: A Within- and Cross-Category Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors attempt to draw profiles of reference-price shoppers. Specifically, the authors study how selected factors that affect brand choice are correlated with consumer sensitivity to gains and losses with respect to internal reference prices. They also study the interaction between sociodemographics and gain and loss sensitivity. Furthermore, the authors analyze cross-category correlations in gain and loss sensitivity to shed light on their individual- and category-specific characters. In three categories, the results show significant heterogeneity in loss sensitivity among consumers and indicate that loss sensitivity is greater and more heterogeneous than gain sensitivity. Across categories, the results show that loss-sensitive shoppers are less influenced by past brand use and that both loss- and gain-sensitive shoppers more sensitive to price, display, and feature than the average consumer. Loss-sensitive households tend to be larger, and their heads are less likely to be fully employed, whereas gain-sensitive households have no clear demographic profile. The authors also discuss the limitations of latent-class models in profiling consumer segments and show how these problems are overcome using models with continuous, correlated multivariate distributions.",1
An Empirical Investigation of the Spillover Effects of Advertising and Sales Promotions in Umbrella Branding,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,The authors investigate and find evidence for advertising and sales promotion spillover effects for umbrella brands in frequently purchased packaged product categories. The authors also capture the impact of advertising (as well as use experience) on both utility mean and variance across two categories. They show that variance of the random component of utility declines over time on the basis of advertising (and use experience) in either category. This constitutes the first empirical evidence for the uncertainty-reducing role of advertising across categories for umbrella brands.,1
Brands as Signals: A Cross-Country Validation Study,Journal of Marketing,2006,"This article tests how well the information economics view of brand equity explains consumer brand choice in countries that represent different cultural dimensions. In this empirical analysis, the authors use survey and experimental data on orange juice and personal computers collected from respondents in Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. The results provide strong empirical evidence across countries for the role of brands as signals of product positions. In addition, the positive effect of brand credibility on choice is greater for consumers who rate high on either collectivism or uncertainty avoidance. Credible brands provide more value to collectivist consumers because such consumers perceive these brands as being of higher quality (i.e., reinforcing group identity). Credible brands provide more value to high-uncertainty-avoidance consumers because such brands have lower perceived risk and information costs.",0
"Performance of Store Brands: A Cross-Country Analysis of Consumer Store-Brand Preferences, Perceptions, and Risk",Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"This article empirically studies consumer choice behavior with respect to store brands in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain. Store-brand market shares differ by country and are usually much higher in Europe than in the United States. The authors study the notion that the differential success of store brands in the United States and Europe is the higher brand equity that store brands command in Europe than in the United States. They use a framework based on consumer brand choice under uncertainty and brands as signals of product positions to conduct their analysis. More specifically, they examine whether uncertainty about quality (or the positioning of the brand in the product space); perceived quality of store brands versus national brands; consistency in store-brand offerings over time; and consumer attitudes toward risk, quality, and price underlie the differential success of store brands at least partially in the United States and Europe. The authors? model is estimated on scanner-panel data on laundry detergent in the U.S., U.K., and Spanish markets and on toilet paper and margarine data in the U.S. and Spanish markets. The authors find that consumer learning and perceived risk (and associated brand equity), as well as consumer attitude toward risk, quality, and price, play an important role in consumers? store-brand and national-brand choices and contribute to the differences in relative success of store brands across the countries studied.",1
"Sales, Marketing, and Research-and-Development Cooperation across New Product Development Stages: Implications for Success",Journal of Marketing,2010,"Prior research has identified the integration of marketing with research and development (R&D) as a key success factor for new product development (NPD). However, prior work has not distinguished the sales and marketing functions, even though they are distinctive departments within an organization. Therefore, the authors extend prior research and examine the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on NPD performance across multiple stages of the NPD process. The authors use multiple-informant data from 424 sales, marketing, and R&D managers as well as project leaders of 106 NPD projects to test several hypotheses. The results show that the cooperation between sales and R&D and between sales and marketing has a significant, positive effect on overall NPD project performance beyond marketing?R&D cooperation. The authors also find that the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on overall NPD project performance varies across stages of the NPD process. More specifically, the authors find that sales?R&D cooperation in the concept and product development stages is critical for greater new product success. Sales?marketing cooperation is important in the concept development stage but has surprisingly less impact in the implementation stage.",0
Hands off my Brand! The Financial Consequences of Protecting Brands through Trademark Infringement Lawsuits,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Well-known brands are frequently imitated, misused, or tampered with. Firms facing these threats routinely turn to the legal system and file trademark infringement lawsuits in an attempt to prevent revenue losses and brand equity dilution. In this article, the authors address the largely unexplored issue of brand protection. First, they categorize all major types of trademark infringement. Second, using signaling and prospect theories, they present a conceptual model that outlines the financial consequences of defending a brand in court. The authors test the predictions of this framework using a large sample of trademark infringement lawsuits and find that although investors react negatively in the short term to firms? filing and even to firms? winning such cases, the long-term performance of firms that successfully leverage the legal system to protect their brands is positive.",0
Navigating the Institutional Logics of Markets: Implications for Strategic Brand Management,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Adopting an institutional theoretic framework, this article examines the evolution and competitive dynamics of markets composed of multiple practices, beliefs, and rule systems. The 30-year historical analysis of the U.S. yoga market illustrates the coexistence of spirituality, medical, fitness, and commercial logics. Using data gathered through archival sources, netnography, in-depth interviews, and participant observations, the authors link shifting emphases on institutional logics and their sustenance to institutional entrepreneurs? accumulation and transmission of cultural capital, strategies to legitimize plural logics, distinct branding practices, and contestations among the pervading logics. The study offers a managerial framework for managing conflicting demands of logics, conveying brand legitimacy, and creating a coherent brand identity in plural logic markets; in addition, it develops a theoretical account of links between institutional logics, competitive dynamics, and market evolution.",0
Choosing Variety for Joint Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers often make choices for joint consumption with committed relationship partners, and these choices may include more or less variety. When planning a weekend for oneself and one's spouse, for example, a person could choose more varied activities (e.g., going out to dinner, to a movie, and to a concert) or less varied activities (e.g., seeing several different movies). What might affect how much variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner. The findings demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on personal or situational factors but also on aspects of consumers? social relationships.",1
"Pressed for Time? Goal Conflict Shapes how Time is Perceived, Spent, and Valued",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Why do consumers often feel pressed for time? This research provides a novel answer to this question: consumers? subjective perceptions of goal conflict. The authors show that beyond the number of goals competing for consumers? time, perceived conflict between goals makes them feel that they have less time. Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as well as how much they are willing to pay to save time. The authors identify two simple interventions that can help consumers mitigate goal conflict's negative effects: slow breathing and anxiety reappraisal. Together, the findings shed light on the factors that drive how consumers perceive, spend, and value their time.",1
How Experience Variety Shapes Postpurchase Product Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Product usage experiences have a significant impact on postpurchase evaluation and subsequent behavior. Consumers look to their own experiences, as well as those of others, when deciding what to buy and what to recommend. Contrary to the intuition that varied experiences should enhance evaluation, five studies demonstrate that in some situations, perceiving usage experiences as less?not more?varied improves postpurchase product evaluation. Less varied usage experiences make consumers think that products are used more frequently. As a result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more likely to recommend it. In addition to their practical implications, the findings make important theoretical contributions to the variety literature and toward understanding frequency and numerosity judgments.",1
Prominence versus Dominance: How Relationships between Alternatives Drive Decision Strategy and Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"This article argues that the structure of a choice set can influence the extent to which consumers weight a given attribute. The results of seven experiments suggest that the relationship between options under consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which respondents evaluate options in the choice set. This article has theoretical implications for research on context effects, contingent decision behavior, and choice architecture as well as practical implications for product-line management.",1
The Asymmetric Impact of Context on Advantaged versus Disadvantaged Options,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Despite substantial prior research regarding the effect of context on choices, uncertainty remains regarding when particular context effects will be observed. In this article, the authors advance a new perspective on context-dependent choices, according to which context effects are a function of the relative advantage of one option over another and of the different strategies that decision makers evoke when making a choice. They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the ?disadvantaged? alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set. The authors conduct a series of studies to analyze the occurrence of context effects and find support for predictions related to asymmetric dominance and extremeness aversion.",1
Points of (Dis)parity: Expectation Disconfirmation from Common Attributes in Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Whereas many theories of decision making predict that presenting or not presenting common features of choice alternatives should not affect choice, in this research, the authors show that common features can be a powerful driver of choice behavior. They conjecture that consumers often hold expectations about the features that choice alternatives have in common, and they demonstrate that presenting (vs. omitting information about) a common feature increases the choice probability of the alternative that would have been expected to perform worse on the common feature, given its performance on differentiating features. This effect occurs because performance on the common feature is judged not at face value but relative to an expectation about which product should perform best on that feature. The effect holds even though performance on the common feature is clearly the same when alternatives are presented side by side. Finally, the authors demonstrate four boundary conditions of this effect.",1
"Psychic Distance: Antecedents, Retail Strategy Implications, and Performance Outcomes",Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors propose a conceptual model of the psychic distance?organizational performance relationship that incorporates organizational factors (international experience and centralization of decision making), entry strategy, and retail strategy implications. The findings suggest that when entering psychically distant markets, retailers should adopt low-cost/low-control entry strategies and adapt their retail strategy to a greater extent than in psychically close markets. However, the authors find that such strategic responses have an adverse effect on performance. They find that international experience, psychic distance, entry strategy, and retail strategy adaptation are significant drivers of organizational performance and factors that determine critical success in international retailing.",0
"Stakeholders and Marketing Capabilities in International New Ventures: Evidence from Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark",Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Few studies have examined the dynamic capabilities perspective in the context of international new ventures (INVs) and, in particular, toward their marketing activities. Using a cross-country case approach, this article explores the role of stakeholders in the marketing capability?building processes of INVs in Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark. The study reveals that different stakeholders play a critical role in influencing how INVs build their marketing capabilities to respond effectively to the dynamic nature of international markets in which they operate. The results show that different stakeholder groups (allied, cooperative, neutral, and entrepreneur) can influence the learning processes (single-, double-, and triple-loop) of the firm and can determine the nature of dynamic marketing capabilities (incremental, renewing, and regenerative) needed to create and sustain international competitive advantage. Furthermore, ?effectuation logic? can explain how entrepreneurs manage and leverage stakeholder relationships in marketing capability processes to cocreate value for the firm. By incorporating dynamic capabilities, stakeholder, and learning theories, this study offers a dynamic, process-oriented model for INV research and provides much-needed qualitative insights into the dynamic capabilities theory of the firm.",0
Quasi-Darwinian Selection in Marketing Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2007,"This article introduces quasi-Darwinian selection as a new explanatory paradigm for marketing relationships. In this paradigm, established relationships are viewed as survivors of a selection process whose parameters are the conduct of the partners, dependencies between the partners, and external adversities in the markets. Selection has the effect of culling certain combinations of these parameters, such as attempts at unilateral control when the partner is not dependent. The effect of selection is to carve out patterns that appear as associations between parameters, for example, between unilateral control and dependence. Traditionally, such associations have been interpreted as causal effects of one parameter on the other. This study shows that quasi-Darwinian selection may sometimes be the more correct explanation of an observed association. The guiding principle can be summarized by the motto ?selection creates association.? As an explanatory paradigm, selection may rival causation. The quasi-Darwinian framework applies to any type of marketing relationships in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. Examples include all relationships in the supply chain, relationships between service providers and customers, and relationships between sales representatives and customers. The article develops the quasi-Darwinian framework in generality, but it emphasizes applications to business-to-business relationships. When associations between relationship parameters are carved out by selection, they can be interpreted as adaptations, and their descriptive meaning has normative implications; if partners in a relationship pattern their conduct according to these associations, on average, they may enhance the longevity of their relationship.",0
RFM and CLV: Using Iso-Value Curves for Customer Base Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors present a new model that links the well-known RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary value) paradigm with customer lifetime value (CLV). Although previous researchers have made a conceptual link, none has presented a formal model with a well-grounded behavioral ?story.? Key to this analysis is the notion of ?iso-value? curves, which enable the grouping of individual customers who have different purchasing histories but similar future valuations. Iso-value curves make it easy to visualize the interactions and trade-offs among the RFM measures and CLV. The stochastic model is based on the Pareto/NBD framework to capture the flow of transactions over time and a gamma-gamma submodel for spend per transaction. The authors conduct several holdout tests to demonstrate the validity of the model's underlying components and then use it to estimate the total CLV for a cohort of new customers of the online music site CDNOW. Finally, the authors discuss broader issues and opportunities in the application of this model in actual practice.",1
Toward an Optimal Donation Solicitation: Evidence from the Field of the Differential Influence of Donor-Related and Organization-Related Information on Donation Choice and Amount,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The present research decomposes consumer donation behavior into two components: donation choice (i.e., whether to donate) and donation amount (i.e., how much to donate). It then considers how information related to the donor and information related to characteristics of the soliciting organization may differentially influence the two decisions. Results from four field experiments suggest that donor-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation choice decision (vs. organization-related appeals), whereas organization-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation amount decision (vs. donor-related appeals). This might lead one to conclude that presenting both types of appeals in a solicitation is ideal. However, the studies presented herein also suggest that this strategy may backfire. The simultaneous presentation of donor- and organization-related appeals can hamper both donation response rates and average contribution amounts. To address this issue, the authors identify and test an alternative solicitation strategy for maximizing solicitation effectiveness. This strategy involves a multistep request process that capitalizes on an understanding of the differential influence of donor- and organization-related information on donation choice and amount decisions.",0
Customer Participation and the Trade-Off between New Product Innovativeness and Speed to Market,Journal of Marketing,2008,"To address the trade-off between new product innovativeness and speed to market caused by customer participation activities, the author differentiates two dimensions of customer participation?customer participation as an information resource (CPI) and customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC)?and explores the moderating effects of downstream customer network connectivity and new product development process interdependence and complexity. Matched data collected from 143 customer?component manufacturer dyads indicate that CPI has a negative influence on innovativeness when downstream customer network connectivity is high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has a positive effect on speed to market when downstream customer network connectivity is high and no significant effect when it is low. In addition, CPC undermines new product speed to market when process interdependence is high. In contrast, CPC can improve new product speed to market but hurt new product innovativeness when process interdependence is low. The results of this article provide specific managerial guidelines as to how to manage customer participation to improve new product innovativeness and speed to market.",0
Understanding the Effects of Plural Marketing Structures on Alliance Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"A plural alliance structure involving multiple downstream partners has become increasingly popular, yet investigations of marketing alliances continue to address mainly dyadic structures. The authors present learning and dependence balancing as key mechanisms to understand the relative performance differences between plural and dyadic structures, as well as the determinants of effective collaboration in a plural structure. Two complementary studies test the performance of plural and dyadic structures in a wide range of high-tech industries. The analysis of both plural and dyadic structure alliances in an event study shows that plural structures outperform dyadic structures for the upstream firm when marketing alliances extend to product-related tasks, the upstream firm has more alliance experience, or the industry is growing fast; however, dyadic structures perform better when the upstream market is more competitive. A second study, focusing only on plural structure alliances, shows that horizontal relationship factors (i.e., market overlap and prior relationship between downstream partners) interact with the upstream firm's greater alliance experience and reputation to lead to better returns for the upstream firm.",1
"If It Takes a Village to Foster Innovation, Success Depends on the Neighbors: The Effects of Global and Ego Networks on New Product Launches",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Launching breakthrough and incremental new products is vital to firm performance; it also resonates with both ego (i.e., directly connected partners) and global (i.e., interconnected ties in an industry) network perspectives. Prior research has listed several ego network? and global network?level factors that affect innovations, but this study goes a step further, to reveal the interactions of these factors as critical product launch mechanisms. An analysis of alliance networks in the consumer packaged goods industry from 1990 to 2010 shows that a central position in a global network represents a double-edged sword: it improves a firm's incremental new product launches but harms its breakthrough new product launches. Furthermore, a firm's ego network (manifested as density and diversity) and R&D capability enable it to leverage its global network position by enhancing the benefits for incremental new products and mitigating its hazards for breakthrough new products. This study's findings thus offer new insights into the role of ego and global networks in facilitating or hindering new product launches.",1
The Timing of Codevelopment Alliances in New Product Development Processes: Returns for Upstream and Downstream Partners,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Upstream biotech firms (i.e., upstream partners) and downstream pharmaceutical firms (i.e., downstream partners) often form alliances to cope with performance uncertainty and to exploit product specificity in new product development. Although the performance implications of such alliances have been investigated, research has not offered insight into how the timing of such codevelopment alliances influences partner returns. The authors develop and test predictions that timing changes the costs and benefits accruing to upstream and downstream partners and that the effect of timing is influenced by a set of alliance, firm, and market conditions. An event study of 276 codevelopment agreements between biotech and pharmaceutical firms during 1998?2010 reveals that alliance governance structure, partner technological capability, and the competitiveness of market environments change the abnormal returns achieved by partners entering these relationships in important ways.",0
Direct and Indirect Effects of Buyers and Sellers on Search Advertising Revenues in Business-to-Business Electronic Platforms,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Platform companies such as Alibaba.com increasingly rely on search advertising as a revenue source. This study examines (1) the direct effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance variables (buyer's click rate and seller's click price), and (3) how the effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage. Finally, using cost data from the platform, this article examines the economic returns of attracting new and existing buyers and sellers with respect to advertising revenue.",1
Effects of Customer and Innovation Asset Configuration Strategies on Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Both customer and innovation assets are important to firm performance. Prior research has mostly examined these assets at the firm level and has not distinguished between the effects of asset depth relative to competitors and asset breadth across different segments. Using configuration theory and the resource-based view of the firm, the authors propose that how these assets interact to influence performance depends on both depth and breadth because these features reflect whether the assets are likely to create and/or appropriate value when deployed. Empirical results from two studies?one using secondary data and another using primary data from a survey of senior managers?indicate that performance is highest when firms employ configurations using deep customer and broad innovation assets or deep innovation and broad customer assets. In contrast, firm performance variability decreases in the presence of deep?deep and broad?broad asset configurations. The effect of configuration strategies on firm performance also is typically greater in dynamic than in stable environments.",1
Trust at Different Organizational Levels,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors explore the effects of trust at three distinct organizational levels in a marketing collaboration: interorganizational trust between collaborating firms, each firm's agency trust in its own representatives assigned to a collaborative entity (coentity), and intraentity trust among the representatives assigned to the coentity. Dyadic survey and longitudinal objective performance data from 114 international joint ventures indicate that trust at each level has unique effects but similarly influences the collaborating firms' resource investments or the coentity's use of those resources. Interorganizational and agency trust motivate resource investments in the coentity, particularly in the context of a differentiation strategy, whereas intraentity trust promotes coordination within the coentity, and interorganizational trust and a differentiation strategy magnify that effect. Intraentity trust can also undermine coentity responsiveness to environmental change, especially when joined by interorganizational trust between collaborating firms and formalized decision making within the coentity. These findings demonstrate that managing and building trust at multiple levels is critical to the success of interorganizational marketing collaborations.",0
Effect of Service Transition Strategies on Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors investigate the effectiveness of service transition strategies for generating shareholder value by evaluating secondary data pertaining to 477 publicly traded manufacturing firms during 1990?2005. The impact of a firm's transition to services on firm value (as measured by Tobin's q) remains relatively flat or slightly negative until the firm reaches a critical mass of service sales (20%?30%), after which point they have an increasingly positive effect. Furthermore, the effect of service sales on firm value depends on both firm and industry factors. Service transition strategies are more effective at enhancing value when the service offerings are related more to the firm's core business and when firms have more available resources (i.e., resource slack). The impact of adding services to core products on firm value amplifies as industry turbulence increases but diminishes when the firm's core products are in high-growth industries.",0
Do we care what others Get? A Behaviorist Approach to Targeted Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Increased access to individual customers and their purchase histories has led to a growth in targeted promotions, including the practice of offering different pricing policies to prospective, as opposed to current, customers. Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs, though with intriguing differences, even when only part of the market is aware of firms? differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in the long run, as information spreads and the proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.",1
Fusing Aggregate and Disaggregate Data with an Application to Multiplatform Media Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"As firms collect greater amounts of data about their customers from an ever broader set of ?touchpoints,? a new set of methodological challenges arises. Companies often collect data from these various platforms at differing levels of aggregation, and it is not clear how to merge these data sources to draw meaningful inferences about customer-level behavior patterns. In this article, the authors provide a method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms over time). The authors conclude with a discussion of how this method can be used in a variety of marketing contexts for which data have become readily available, such as gauging the interplay between online and brick-and-mortar purchasing behavior.",1
Executive Insights: Market Orientation of Mexican Companies,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"This study suggests that companies from a sample in an industrialized region in northern Mexico are confident about their level of overall market orientation but that differences in their customer and competitor orientation exist. The authors test market orientation for its relationship to several other variables, such as company size, type of product, and use of a marketing plan, and they discuss the implications for marketing theory and practice.",0
Marketing Department Power and Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This study empirically investigates marketing department power in U.S. firms throughout 1993?2008 and assesses its impact on firm performance. Using a new objective measure of marketing department power and a cross-industry sample of 612 public firms in the United States, the results reveal that, in general, marketing department power increased during this time period. Furthermore, the analyses show that a powerful marketing department enhances firms' longer-term future total shareholder returns beyond its positive effect on firms' short-term return on assets (ROA). The findings also reveal that a firm's long-run market-based-asset-building and short-run market-based- asset-leveraging capabilities partially mediate the effect of a firm's marketing department power on its longer-term shareholder value performance and fully mediate the effect on its short-term ROA performance. This research provides new insights for marketing scholars and managers with regard to both marketing's influence within the firm and how investments in building a powerful marketing department affect firm performance.",0
A Conjoint Approach for Consumer- and Firm-Level Brand Valuation,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article develops and tests a reduced-form, conjoint methodology for measuring brand equity. The proposed approach (1) provides objective dollar-metric values for brand equity without the need to collect perceptual or brand association data, (2) captures the effects of awareness and availability in the marketplace as sources of brand equity, (3) accounts for competitive reaction, (4) allows the mix of branded and unbranded firms to affect industry size, and (5) uses consideration set theory to project market share estimates from the conjoint experiment to the marketplace. Managers can use the approach to develop customized strategies for targeting customers, monitoring brand ?health,? allocating resources, and determining the values of brands in a merger or acquisition. The empirical results suggest that the proposed metric for measuring consumer-level brand equity has convergent validity; in addition, the magnitudes and strengths of brand equity vary considerably across consumers and brands. At the firm level, the results show that previous methods are likely to overstate brand equity, especially for products with low market shares. Finally, the results show that the external validity for the proposed brand equity measures is high.",1
"Look at Me! Look at Me! Conspicuous Brand Usage, Self-Brand Connection, and Dilution",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Conspicuous brand usage, defined as attention-getting use of a brand, causes brand dilution under certain conditions. This research examines changes in observers' attitudes toward a brand after seeing a brand user engaged in conspicuous use of the brand. The authors propose that observers infer that a consumer engaged in conspicuous brand usage is driven by an ulterior motive of impression management. When observers have low self-brand connection, they exhibit less favorable attitudes toward both the brand user and the brand. In contrast, observers with high self-brand connection maintain their favorable view of the brand in the face of a conspicuous brand user. Three studies demonstrate the brand dilution effect of conspicuous brand usage.",1
Technological Innovation and Exports: Unpacking Their Reciprocal Causality,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"The authors aim to advance extant understanding of the dynamics of firms operating abroad by considering the effects of innovation (research-and-development intensity, product and process innovations) on exports (breadth and depth), and vice versa. The study analyzes a panel data set of 696 Spanish manufacturing firms during 1994?2005 using Tobit and logit regressions and the Granger test of causality to offer a more complete picture of this complex relationship. They find broad support for the notion that innovation and exports have a reciprocal causal relationship, although the findings are partly nuanced by positive but nonsignificant associations between product innovation and exports and between export depth and process innovation. Furthermore, both export and innovation processes Granger-cause each other, demonstrating that there is a double causal relationship.",0
Educator Insights: Globalization of Fragmentation?A Framework for Understanding Contemporary Global Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"The article presents several arguments and evidence that the globalization process, which has become of great interest to many scholars, is not a uniform and universalizing process, but a fragmented one. The characteristics of this globalization of fragmentation are discussed and some reasons for its development are provided. Four major reasons discussed are: (1) the nature of the modern market, (2) the transforming consumers, (3) global communications, and (4) increasing multilayeredness of cultures. Implications of these factors for globalization of fragmentation and for international marketing are briefly discussed.",0
Patient-or Physician-Oriented Marketing: What Drives Primary Demand for Prescription Drugs?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors analyze primary demand effects of marketing efforts directed at the physician (detailing and professional journal advertising) versus marketing efforts directed at the patient (direct-to-consumer advertising). The analysis covers 86 categories, or approximately 85% of the U.S. pharmaceutical market, during the 2001?2005 period. Primary demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand. The suggested brand-level method does not suffer from these limitations.",1
"How Important Are Brands? A Cross-Category, Cross-Country Study",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article focuses on the measurement of the overall importance of brands for consumer decision making?that is, brand relevance in category, or BRiC?across multiple categories and countries. Although brand equity measures for specific brands have attracted a large body of literature, the questions of how important brands are within an entire product category and the extent to which BRiC differs across categories and countries have been neglected. The authors introduce the concept of BRiC (a category-level measure, not a brand-level measure). They develop a conceptual framework to measure BRiC and the drivers of BRiC, test the framework empirically with a sample of more than 5700 consumers, and show how the construct varies across 20 product categories and five countries (France, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The results suggest a high validity of the proposed BRiC measure and show substantial differences between categories and countries. A replication study two-and-a-half years later confirms the psychometric properties of the suggested scale and shows remarkable stability of the findings. The findings have important implications for the management of brand investments.",1
The Value of Rapid Delivery in Omnichannel Retailing,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors study how faster delivery in the online channel affects sales within and across channels in omnichannel retailing. The authors leverage a quasi-experiment involving the opening of a new distribution center by a U.S. apparel retailer, which resulted in unannounced faster deliveries to western U.S. states through its online channel. Using a difference-in-differences approach, the authors show that online store sales increased, on average, by 1.45% per business-day reduction in delivery time, from a baseline of seven business days. The authors also find a positive spillover effect to the retailer?s offline stores. These effects increase gradually in the short-to-medium run as the result of higher order count. The authors identify two main drivers of the observed effect: (1) customer learning through service interactions with the retailer and (2) existing brand presence in terms of online store penetration rate and offline store presence. Customers with less online store experience are more responsive to faster deliveries in the short run, whereas experienced online store customers are more responsive in the long run.",1
"Internationalization Knowledge: What, Why, Where, and When?",Journal of International Marketing,2013,"The acquisition of relevant knowledge plays a critical role in the internationalization process. Yet a complete understanding of internationalization knowledge (IK) remains largely unexplored in the international marketing literature. The authors develop a framework that distinguishes three categories of IK necessary for internationalizing firms to gain market entry, localize strategies, and organize international enterprise procedures. Employing a longitudinal qualitative analysis of ten internationalizing firms, this study examines (1) why firms need these IK categories, (2) where they source them, and (3) at what stage of international growth they are needed. The authors conclude by addressing implications for practice and recommend that managers should source the specific IK needed before it becomes critical.",0
Exploring the Phenomenon of Customers' Desired Value Change in a Business-to-Business Context,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Increasingly, organizations are pushed to adopt customer value strategies in order to grow profits and ensure long-term survival. Yet little is known about the dynamic nature of how customers perceive value from suppliers. The authors present findings from a grounded theory study conducted in a business-to-business context that sheds light on the nature of customers' desired value change and related contextual conditions. The authors discover that the phenomenon of customers' desired value change typically occurs in an emotional context, as managers try to cope with feelings of tension. The phenomenon extends well past the change itself into strategies customers use to motivate suppliers to meet their changed needs. Customers' value change provides a reason for customers to seek, maintain, or move away from relationships with suppliers.",0
A Hierarchical Bayes Error Correction Model to Explain Dynamic Effects of Price Changes,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors put forth a sales response model to explain the differences in immediate and dynamic effects of promotional prices and regular prices on sales. The model consists of a vector autoregression that is rewritten in error correction format, which allows the authors to disentangle the immediate effects from the dynamic effects. In a second level of the model, the immediate price elasticities, the cumulative promotional price elasticity, and the long-term regular price elasticity are correlated with various brand-specific and category-specific characteristics. The model is applied to seven years of data on weekly sales of 100 different brands in 25 product categories. The authors find many significant moderating effects on the elasticity of price promotions. Brands in categories that are characterized by high price differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find significant effects for the cumulative elasticity. The immediate effect of a regular price change is often close to zero. The long-term effect of such a regular price decrease usually amounts to an increase in sales. This is especially true in categories that are characterized by a large price dispersion and frequent price promotions and for hedonic, nonperishable products.",1
"Consumer Animosity, Country of Origin, and Foreign Entry-Mode Choice: A Cross-Country Investigation",Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Drawing on the perspective of country of origin, this study provides evidence regarding how entry-mode choice and postentry branding strategy affect foreign product purchase intentions in an animosity context. The authors conduct two studies in two host country markets, one with high animosity (China) and the other with low animosity (Taiwan) toward a target country (Japan). The results of Study 1 reveal that in a high-animosity host country, consumers prefer the foreign products launched through an acquisition joint venture to those that are imports or the derivatives of full acquisition. The findings of Study 2 indicate that in a high-animosity host country, consumers prefer the foreign products launched through an acquisition joint venture mode that adopts a local brand or a local-foreign cobrand to one that adopts a foreign-local cobrand. In contrast, in a low-animosity host country, entry modes and postentry branding strategies have no effect on foreign product purchase intentions.",0
"Targeted Promotions on an E-Book Platform: Crowding Out, Heterogeneity, and Opportunity Costs",Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Targeted promotions based on individual purchase history can increase sales. However, the opportunity costs of targeting to optimize promoted product sales are poorly understood. A series of randomized field experiments with a large e-book platform shows that although targeted promotions increase promoted product sales and purchases of similar products, they can crowd out purchases of dissimilar products (i.e., e-books from nontargeted genres) by decreasing search activities of nontargeted goods on the same platform. The effects on total sales are heterogeneous, ranging from net decreases to insignificant drops, motivating a targeting exercise comparing strategies that optimize promoted product sales versus total sales. Targeting for promoted product sales tends to assign promotions to customers who purchased similar products, whereas targeting for total sales assigns promotions on the basis of other user characteristics. Targeting for promoted product sales generated incremental total sales that amounted to approximately 29% of the optimal incremental total sales when targeting for total sales (an opportunity cost of 71%). The optimal targeting exercise highlights how maximizing promotional lift can incur opportunity costs in terms of other forgone sales.",1
Geo-Conquesting: Competitive Locational Targeting of Mobile Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"As consumers spend more time on their mobile devices, a focal retailer's natural approach is to target potential customers in close proximity to its own location. Yet focal (own) location targeting may cannibalize profits on inframarginal sales. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of competitive locational targeting, the practice of promoting to consumers near a competitor's location. The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal, and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to generate incremental sales without cannibalizing profits. Although the experiment focuses on the effects of unilateral promotions, it represents an initial step in understanding the competitive implications of mobile marketing technologies.",1
Moral Judgment and Market Negotiations: A Comparison of Chinese and American Managers,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Given the potential of the trading relationship between the People's Republic of China and the United States, insight into the Sino-American market negotiation process has never been more important. This exploratory study compares the Cognitive Moral Development (CMD) and negotiation style of international business people from mainland China with their direct American counterparts. In so doing, insight is gained concerning the cultural underpinnings of the market negotiation process with this very important, yet very foreign, Asian trading partner.",0
What We See Makes Us who We are: Priming Ethnic Self-Awareness and Advertising Response,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors propose that ?ethnic self-awareness??a temporary state during which a person is more sensitive to information related to his or her own ethnicity?moderates consumer response to targeted advertising. Ethnic self-awareness occurs when a person engages in a process of self-categorization and uses ethnic criteria as the basis for this categorization. The authors hypothesize that ?ethnic primes??visual or verbal cues that draw attention to ethnicity?direct self-categorization and increase ethnic self-awareness. To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct two experiments. Using 109 Asian and Caucasian participants, Experiment 1 assessed the impact of exposure to an Asian ethnic prime on ethnic self-awareness and on response to targeted television advertising. Exposure to an ethnic prime increased the rate at which participants spontaneously mentioned their ethnicity in self-descriptions (a measure of ethnic self-awareness) and caused participants to respond more favorably to same-ethnicity spokespeople and advertising that targeted their ethnicity. Experiment 2 tested the theory in a print advertising context and extended the design by manipulating the type of ethnic prime participants saw (Asian or Caucasian) and the market that the focal advertisement targeted (Asian or Caucasian). Experiment 2 replicated the findings of Experiment 1 when the focal advertisement targeted Asians, but not when it targeted Caucasians.",1
"Customer Satisfaction and Stock Prices: High Returns, Low Risk",Journal of Marketing,2006,"Do investments in customer satisfaction lead to excess returns? If so, are these returns associated with higher stock market risk? The empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically, the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), is significantly related to market value of equity. Yet news about ACSI results does not move share prices. This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested, and the second is an actual case. At low systematic risk, both outperform the market by considerable margins. In other words, it is possible to beat the market consistently by investing in firms that do well on the ACSI.",0
Stock Returns on Customer Satisfaction Do Beat the Market: Gauging the Effect of a Marketing Intangible,Journal of Marketing,2016,"A debate about whether firms with superior customer satisfaction earn superior stock returns has been persistent in the literature. Using 15 years of audited returns, the authors find convincing empirical evidence that stock returns on customer satisfaction do beat the market. The recorded cumulative returns were 518% over the years studied (2000?2014), compared with a 31% increase for the S&P 500. Similar results using back-tested instead of real returns were found in the United Kingdom. The effect of customer satisfaction on stock price is, at least in part, channeled through earnings surprises. Consistent with theory, customer satisfaction has an effect on earnings themselves. In addition, the authors examine the effect of stock returns from earnings on stock returns from customer satisfaction. If earnings returns are included among the risk factors in the asset pricing model, the earnings variable partially mitigates the returns on customer satisfaction. Because of the long time series, it is also possible to examine time periods when customer satisfaction returns were below market. The reversal of the general trend largely resulted from short-term market idiosyncrasies with little or no support from fundamentals. Such irregularities have been infrequent and eventually self-correcting. The authors provide reasons why irregularities may occur from time to time.",0
An Abnormally Abnormal Intangible: Stock Returns on Customer Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Sorescu and Sorescu (2016) and Bharadwaj and Mitra (2016) have made a number of insightful observations and suggestions for future research regarding stock returns on customer satisfaction. They have also provided a series of assessments of a study by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016) that focus on abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. Building on the original study, as well as the two commentaries and previous research, the study's authors argue that the published empirical evidence is quite consistent in favor of abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. These findings are also supported by the new analysis of Sorescu and Sorescu, who make several important contributions, not only regarding the persistence of abnormal returns over and beyond the technology sector but also with respect to the critical importance of industry classification in the context of customer satisfaction?something that definitely calls for more research attention. In fact, there are many avenues for future research on the economic and financial impact of customer satisfaction, as laid out in the commentaries, the authors? original article, and this response.",0
The Effect of Customer Satisfaction on Consumer Spending Growth,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Predicting aggregate consumer spending is vitally important to marketing planning, yet traditional economic theory holds that predicting changes in aggregate consumer spending is not possible. Previous attempts to predict consumer spending growth using standard macroeconomic predictor variables have met with little success. The authors show that the lagged change in customer satisfaction, which contributes to future demand, has a significant impact on spending growth. However, this impact is moderated by increases in consumers? debt service ratio, a key budget constraint that affects consumers? ability to spend. Using an asymmetric growth model, more than 23% of the variation in the one-quarter-ahead spending growth is explained, which represents a notable improvement over prior specifications.",1
Shopper Response to Bundle Promotions for Packaged Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Bundle promotions?the practice of granting consumers a discount when they buy a certain number of units from a designated range of stockkeeping units?have gained popularity among manufacturers and retailers. In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the basis of the model estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines for optimal bundle design.",1
Putting the Person Back in Person-Brands: Understanding and Managing the Two-Bodied Brand,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article provides insight into the management of brands that are also people by unpacking the interdependencies that exist between people and brands and focusing on the qualities that make person-brands human rather than on the qualities that make them brands. Using the extended case method to examine 20 years of public data about the Martha Stewart brand, the authors highlight the interdependent relationship between the person and the brand?in particular, consistency and balance?and identify four aspects of the person that can upset these interdependencies: mortality, hubris, unpredictability, and social embeddedness. Mortality and hubris can cause imbalance, but with the right skills and structures, these factors can be proactively managed. Inconsistency in the meanings of the person versus the brand can derive from the person?s unpredictability and social embeddedness and compromise brand value, but it may also enhance brand value by adding needed intimacy and authenticity. This two-bodied conceptualization suggests renewed management principles and contributes to branding theory through identification of the doppelgnger within, new brand strength facets, and emphasis on risk versus returns.",1
Cherry-Picking,Journal of Marketing,2005,"The authors analyze cherry-picking in the context of grocery shopping, comparing the behavior of consumers who visit two grocery stores on the same day (8% of shopping trips) with single-store shoppers. The authors find cherry-picking to be consistent with rational economic behavior. Cherry pickers benefit by saving 5% more per item while buying systematically (67%) larger market baskets.",0
The Impact of Firms? Export Orientation on the Export Performance of High-Tech Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,Journal of International Marketing,2000,The authors provide empirical support for the importance of a proactive export orientation in driving export success in the uncertain high-tech environment. Regression analysis demonstrates that proactive and conservative export strategies and motivations produce opposite effects on multiple measures of export performance for these small and medium-sized Canadian high-tech firms in the information technology and telecommunications sector.,0
Executive Insights: The Impact of Linguistic Differences on International Brand Name Standardization: A Comparison of English and Chinese Brand Names of Fortune-500 Companies,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The authors investigate the brand name standardization/adaptation strategies used by consumer goods Fortune-500 companies in China and Hong Kong. The authors compare English brand names with Chinese brand names on several dimensions. The vast majority of firms localize their brand names, and transliteration of the brand name is the strategy used most often. Firms also appear to be successful in avoiding unfortunate brand name mistakes and add features to the brand names, such as cultural symbols, additional product benefits, and more positive connotations, when localizing the brand name for the Chinese market.",0
Salesperson Adaptive Selling Behavior and Customer Orientation: A Meta-Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors combine findings from 155 samples of more than 31,000 salespeople to test alternative models of antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling behavior (ASB) and customer orientation (CO). A random-effects meta-analysis yields average values for 28 different correlations ranging from -.16 to .35, 19 of which are significant. Controlling for salesperson gender and selling experience, structural equation modeling indicates that ASB increases self-rated, manager-rated, and objective measures of performance, whereas CO increases only self-rated performance. Both ASB and CO increase job satisfaction. Tests of reciprocal relationships indicate that ASB increases CO and job satisfaction increases performance rather than vice versa. Selling experience increases performance but not job satisfaction, and saleswomen rate their performance and satisfaction slightly higher than salesmen do. The magnitudes of the relationships indicate that ASB and selling experience have greater effects than CO and gender on salesperson performance.",1
Testing the Value of Customization: When Do Customers Really Prefer Products Tailored to Their Preferences?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Recently, researchers have paid increasing attention to the marketing strategy of customization. A key assumption is that customized products create higher benefits for customers than standard products because they deliver a closer preference fit. The prerequisite for this effect is the ability to obtain precise information on what customers actually want. But are customers able to specify their preferences that precisely? Several theoretical arguments raise doubts about this, implicitly challenging the value of customization. The authors conduct two studies in which they find that products customized on the basis of expressed preferences bring about significantly higher benefits for customers in terms of willingness to pay, purchase intention, and attitude toward the product than standard products. The benefit gain is higher if customers have (1) better insight into their own preferences, (2) a better ability to express their preferences, and (3) greater product involvement. This suggests that customization has the potential to be a powerful marketing strategy if these conditions are met. In the opposite case, firms willing to serve heterogeneous customer preferences need to adapt their customization systems in such a way that they explicitly address the customers? inability to provide valid preference information.",0
On the Use of Econometric Models for Policy Simulation in Marketing,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In this article, the author discusses the properties of useful econometric models for marketing phenomena, with particular attention on models for policy simulations.

Distributor Sharing of Strategic Information with Suppliers,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Distributor sharing of strategic information with suppliers is an important but underresearched issue within the marketing discipline. The authors develop and test a conceptual framework based on exchange theory that focuses on the degree to which distributors share external and internal strategic information with associated suppliers. Relying on survey data collected from 479 distributors across three industries, the authors find that distributors share strategic information with suppliers according to factors that affect the perceived benefits, costs, and risks of such behavior. The sharing of internal strategic information has distinct determinants compared with those of external strategic information. The interrelationships between environmental uncertainty and the sharing of internal strategic information, including both main and interactive effects, are especially notable.",0
The Limits of Attraction,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the introduction of an ?irrelevant? third option affects preferences between the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles?a phenomenon known as the ?attraction effect.? In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.",1
Toward a Typology of Commitment States among Managers of Born-Global Firms: A Study of Accelerated Internationalization,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Substantial scholarly work has shed much light on the development of a contemporary global environment?namely, the phenomenon of born-global firms. These young entrepreneurial firms, which take on internationalization early in their evolution, are now found in large numbers in most economies, especially in smaller, saturated, developed markets. In this article, the authors advance some theoretical explanations regarding the behavior of these firms. In the current Australian case-based study, rather than engaging in a firm-level analysis, the authors focus on the attitudinal orientations of senior management in this new breed of internationally active firms. In contrast to an incremental approach, the authors offer a theoretical explanation that integrates the network perspective and resource-based view with international entrepreneurship. Their exploration of the managerial mind-set of these smaller born-global firms leads to the identification of four states of commitment to accelerated internationalization by top management. Delineating these states should assist managers in achieving their accelerated internationalization objectives. Any of the four attitudinal mind-sets facilitates internationalization, but the strategist state adopts a more benevolent, collaborative behavioral stance designed to preserve key relationships. The strategist also avoids the short-term orientation, competitiveness, and self-interest of the responder, the opportunist, and the experimentalist.",0
How Smaller Born-Global Firms Use Networks and Alliances to Overcome Constraints to Rapid Internationalization,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The authors identify the following key constraints that smaller born-global firms face: lack of economies of scale, lack of resources (financial and knowledge), and aversion to risk taking. The authors explore how such firms overcome these constraints by using technology to achieve competitive advantage and by networking competencies to develop a range of alliances and collaborative partnerships. Thus, the article focuses on a particular aspect of business-to-business marketing, namely, how small firms achieve rapid growth internationally through alliances with suppliers, distributors, and joint-venture partners and how these relationships change over time to meet the changing needs of the partners.",0
The Integrated Networks Model: Explaining Resource Allocations in Network Markets,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The last decade has witnessed a shift from a focus on the value created by a single firm and product to an examination of the value created by networks of firms (or product ecosystems) in which assets are comingled with external entities. The authors examine these market-based assets in the context of network markets and propose an Integrated Networks model in which three types of networks?user, complements, and producer?add value or enhance the attractiveness of the associated focal product. The authors empirically test the proposed model by surveying information technology professionals on their resource allocation decisions regarding the Unix and Windows NT operating systems. The findings suggest that the value added by these three networks is significantly and positively associated with resources allocated by business customers to competing products. The results also show that the three networks mediate the relationship between stand-alone product performance and resource allocation.",0
Value Appropriation and Firm Shareholder Value: Role of Advertising and Receivables Management,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Value-appropriation activities enable a firm to extract more profits from existing customers. The authors examine how investments in two types of value-appropriation activities?advertising and receivables?are jointly associated with abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. Using data from 1,375 firms over the period of 2003?2015, the authors find that advertising investments and receivables investments interact as substitutes, such that increasing advertising (receivables) investments is detrimental to the beneficial effect of receivables (advertising) investments on firm shareholder value. They find that this association is contingent on firm business scope, such that the joint effect of advertising investments and receivables investments becomes weaker when firms have a broader business scope compared with a narrower business scope.",1
What Counts versus what can be Counted: The Complex Interplay of Market Orientation and Marketing Performance Measurement,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Market orientation (MO) and marketing performance measurement (MPM) are two of the most widespread strategic marketing concepts among practitioners. However, some have questioned the benefits of extensive investments in MO and MPM. More importantly, little is known about which combinations of MO and MPM are optimal in ensuring high business performance. To address this research gap, the authors analyze a unique data set of 628 firms with a novel method of configurational analysis: fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. In line with prior research, the authors find that MO is an important determinant of business performance. However, to reap its benefits, managers need to complement it with appropriate MPM, the level and focus of which vary across firms. For example, whereas large firms and market leaders generally benefit from comprehensive MPM, small firms may benefit from measuring marketing performance only selectively or by focusing on particular dimensions of marketing performance. The study also finds that many of the highest-performing firms do not follow any of the particular best practices identified.",0
"Motivating Salespeople to Sell New Products: The Relative Influence of Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and Self-Efficacy",Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research explores the relative influence of salespeople's attitudes toward selling a new product, perceptions of subjective norms, and self-efficacy on the development of selling intentions and, ultimately, the success of a new product launch. The longitudinal study employs a nonlinear growth curve model that leverages survey data from industrial salespeople and objective performance records of their daily sales during the first several months in the market of two new products: a new-to-market product and a line extension. By examining salesperson-level variance on new product performance, the authors suggest that managers should focus on increasing salesperson self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward selling the product to build selling intentions and quickly grow new product performance. They also suggest that sales managers should resist the temptation to rely on normative pressure during a new product introduction. Not only are subjective norms less effective in building selling intentions, but they also diminish the positive impact of attitudes and self-efficacy on salesperson intentions and constrain the positive relationships between intentions and performance and self-efficacy and performance.",0
The Psychological Effects of Empowerment Strategies on Consumers? Product Demand,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Companies have recently begun to use the Internet to integrate their customers more actively into various phases of the new product development process. One such strategy involves empowering customers to cooperate in selecting the product concepts to be marketed by the firm. In such scenarios, it is no longer the company but rather its customers who decide democratically which products should be produced. This article discusses the first set of empirical studies that highlight the important psychological consequences of this power shift. The results indicate that customers who are empowered to select the products to be marketed show stronger demand for the underlying products even though they are of identical quality in objective terms (and their subjective product evaluations are similar). This seemingly irrational finding can be observed because consumers develop a stronger feeling of psychological ownership of the products selected. The studies also identify two boundary conditions for this ?empowerment?product demand? effect: It diminishes (1) if the outcome of the joint decision-making process does not reflect consumers? preferences and (2) if consumers do not believe that they have the relevant competence to make sound decisions.",0
All That is Users Might Not be Gold: How Labeling Products as User Designed Backfires in the Context of Luxury Fashion Brands,Journal of Marketing,2013,"An emerging literature stream posits that drawing on users rather than internal designers in new product creation may benefit firms because the resulting products effectively satisfy consumer needs. Four studies conducted in the context of the luxury fashion industry uncover an important conceptual boundary condition of this positive user-design effect. Contrary to extant research, the results show that being ?close? to users does not help but rather harms luxury fashion brands. Specifically, the authors find that user design backfires because consumer demand for a given luxury fashion brand collection is reduced if the collection is labeled as user (vs. company) designed. The results further reveal the underlying rationale for this reversal: user-designed luxury products are perceived to be lower in quality and fail to signal high status, which results in a loss of agentic feelings for the consumer. The authors explore several strategies luxury brands can pursue to overcome this negative user-design effect. Finally, they find that negative outcomes of user design are attenuated for luxury fashion products that are not used for status signaling?that is, product categories of a luxury brand that are characterized by lower status relevance for the consumer.",0
The Handmade Effect: What's Love Got to Do with It?,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Despite the popularity and high quality of machine-made products, handmade products have not disappeared, even in product categories in which machinal production is common. The authors present the first systematic set of studies exploring whether and how stated production mode (handmade vs. machine-made) affects product attractiveness. Four studies provide evidence for the existence of a positive handmade effect on product attractiveness. This effect is, to an important extent, driven by perceptions that handmade products symbolically ?contain love.? The authors validate this love account by controlling for alternative value drivers of handmade production (effort, product quality, uniqueness, authenticity, and pride). The handmade effect is moderated by two factors that affect the value of love. Specifically, consumers indicate stronger purchase intentions for handmade than machine-made products when buying gifts for their loved ones but not for more distant gift recipients, and they pay more for handmade gifts when purchased to convey love than simply to acquire the best-performing product.",0
Organizational Multichannel Differentiation: An Analysis of Its Impact on Channel Relationships and Company Sales Success,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This article examines whether and how a company's division of segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels affects the relationships in the multichannel (MC) system and, ultimately, the company's sales success. Building on open systems theory, the authors develop an overarching framework of organizational MC differentiation that distinguishes between two generic approaches: segment differentiation and task differentiation. They predict that these two approaches affect key relationship and performance outcomes of an MC system, but do so differently and contingent on key characteristics of the company's customers. Drawing on a multi-informant survey in a business-to-business context as well as on objective performance data, the authors find that segment differentiation tends to mitigate horizontal conflict and inhibit cooperation, while task differentiation reduces primarily vertical conflict and promotes cooperation. Moreover, depending on customer characteristics, segment differentiation may damage channel relationships overall and, in turn, limit company sales success, whereas task differentiation unambiguously promotes channel relationships and thus drives company sales success. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship and performance impact of MC systems? organizational structure and provide useful guidance on how managers should allocate segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels.",0
P2V-MAP: Mapping Market Structures for Large Retail Assortments,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors propose a new, exploratory approach for analyzing market structures that leverages two recent methodological advances in natural language processing and machine learning. They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.",1
Multiple Channel Strategies in the European Personal Computer Industry,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The authors examine sales channel strategies for international expansion as a means of compensating for constantly decreasing unit prices and margins in the personal computer (PC) industry operation in the European Union market. The authors describe and analyze the development from single (direct or indirect) to multiple (dual or hybrid) sales channel strategy for international expansion on the basis of four theoretical approaches. The methodology used is a qualitative research strategy. The authors conduct a longitudinal multiple case study consisting of 20 top management interviews related to four cases. They examine the development of the sales channel strategies of selected large companies in the European PC business. Multiple sales channels, especially the hybrid ones, are an optimal solution for expanding sales volumes. The results contribute to the relatively underresearched area of multiple channels, and the managerial implications drawn should be helpful not only to PC companies but also to other firms, such as ?born globals.?",0
Marketing Strategies for Foreign Expansion of Companies Originating in Small and Open Economies: The Consequences of Strategic Fit and Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"This study examines the marketing strategies of companies originating in small and open economies as they expand into foreign markets. It distinguishes two major globalization paths (that of born globals and that of globalizing internationals), contrasts them with traditional internationalizers, and describes their characteristics. It then outlines a framework and hypotheses regarding the marketing strategies used in foreign expansion and examines them empirically in the information and communication technology field. The authors examine two important strategic marketing issues: the breadth of product offering and the standardization of marketing strategies across countries. The empirical results show that foreign expansion path, foreign business experience, and external globalization pressure have an impact on the selection of marketing strategies. The study also finds that the fit between these contextual factors and the standardization of marketing strategy has a positive effect on performance. The novel results regarding the importance of foreign expansion paths in the selection of marketing strategies have important implications for both academicians and practitioners in the field of international marketing.",0
Making Recommendations More Effective Through Framings: Impacts of User- Versus Item-Based Framings on Recommendation Click-Throughs,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Companies frequently offer product recommendations to customers, according to various algorithms. This research explores how companies should frame the methods they use to derive their recommendations, in an attempt to maximize click-through rates. Two common framings?user-based and item-based?might describe the same recommendation. User-based framing emphasizes the similarity between customers (e.g., ?People who like this also like??); item-based framing instead emphasizes similarities between products (e.g., ?Similar to this item?). Six experiments, including two field experiments within a mobile app, show that framing the same recommendation as user-based (vs. item-based) can increase recommendation click-through rates. The findings suggest that user-based (vs. item-based) framing informs customers that the recommendation is based on not just product matching but also taste matching with other customers. Three theoretically derived and practically relevant boundary conditions related to the recommendation recipient, the products, and other users also offer practical guidance for managers regarding how to leverage recommendation framings to increase recommendation click-throughs.",0
Can Small Victories Help Win the War? Evidence from Consumer Debt Management,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The question of how people should structure goal-directed activity to maximize the likelihood of goal attainment is one of theoretical and practical significance. In particular, should people begin by attempting relatively easy tasks or more difficult ones? How might these differing strategies affect the likelihood of completing the overarching goal? The authors examine this question in the context of an important goal for a large number of consumers?getting out of debt. Using a data set obtained from a debt settlement firm, they find that (1) closing debt accounts is predictive of debt elimination regardless of the dollar balance of the closed accounts, whereas (2) the dollar balance of closed accounts is not predictive of debt elimination when controlling for the fraction of accounts closed. These findings suggest that completing discrete subtasks might motivate consumers to persist in pursuit of a goal. The authors discuss implications for goal pursuit generally and for consumer debt management specifically.",1
Answering the Unasked Question: Response Substitution in Consumer Surveys,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Researchers and practitioners alike frequently survey consumers to gain insights into their attitudes, preferences, and beliefs. The authors propose a potentially pervasive, but as of yet unidentified, source of bias in survey responding. Specifically, they propose that respondents? answers to questions might sometimes reflect attitudes that respondents want to convey but that the researcher has not asked about, a phenomenon termed ?response substitution.? The authors examine this proposition in a series of three experiments that demonstrate the phenomenon, provide support for the process account, and identify boundary conditions. They also discuss general theoretical, methodological, and practical implications as well as specific implications for research on attitudes and contingent valuation.",1
The Impact of Advertising on Media Bias,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"In this study, the authors investigate the role of advertising in affecting the extent of bias in the media. When making advertising choices, advertisers evaluate both the size and the composition of the readership of the different outlets. The profile of the readers matters because advertisers want to target readers who are likely to be receptive to their advertising messages. The authors demonstrate that when advertising supplements subscription fees, it may serve as a polarizing or moderating force, contingent on the extent of heterogeneity among advertisers in appealing to readers having different political preferences. When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet relies on subscription fees only for revenues. In contrast, when heterogeneity is small, each advertiser chooses to place advertisements in multiple outlets (multihoming) and reduces polarization results.",1
Microfinance Decision Making: A Field Study of Prosocial Lending,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Microfinancing, or small uncollateralized loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world, has recently emerged as a leading contender to cure world poverty. Our research investigates the characteristics of borrowers that engender lending through Kiva, a popular organization that connects individual lenders to borrowers through online microfinance. Lenders favor individual borrowers over groups or consortia of borrowers, a pattern consistent with the identifiable victim effect. They also favor borrowers that are socially proximate to themselves. Across three dimensions of social distance (gender, occupation, and first name initial), lenders prefer to give to those who are more like themselves.",1
Buffering and Amplifying Effects of Relationship Commitment in Business-to-Business Relationships,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Using an assimilation and contrast framework, the authors assess the buffering and amplifying effects of relationship commitment on organizational buyers? intentions to switch suppliers when a relationship is strained by the incumbent's own misbehavior. The results of three studies show that both calculative and affective commitment buffer incumbent suppliers against minor incidences of their own misbehavior but that affective commitment also reliably amplifies the adverse effects of an incumbent supplier's flagrant opportunism. Process tests indicate that buyer perceptions of supplier conformance to normative standards account for (completely mediate) the observed buffering and amplification effects in a manner consistent with the underlying assimilation and contrast framework.",1
Does Distance Still Matter? Geographic Proximity and New Product Development,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Many firms rely on external organizations to acquire knowledge that is useful for developing creative new products and reducing the time needed to bring these products to market. Cluster theory suggests that this knowledge is often obtained from organizations located in close geographic proximity. Specifically, proximity is assumed to foster heightened face-to-face communication, strengthened relational ties, increased knowledge acquisition, and enhanced new product outcomes. The authors identify the limitations of these assumptions and offer an enriched model of the influence of geographic proximity on new product development, which they test using both a cross-sectional survey of 155 firms in the U.S. optics industry and a longitudinal follow-up survey of 73 of these firms. They find that firms located in close proximity engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this communication has little effect on the acquisition of the types of knowledge that lead to enhanced new product outcomes. In contrast, they find that e-mail communication leads to both enhanced new product creativity and development speed. In addition, they find that relational ties moderate rather than mediate the path connecting geographic proximity and new product outcomes. These findings imply that the new product development outcomes typically ascribed to close geographic proximity may actually be attributed to strong relational ties.",0
Converging Trends within the European Union: Insights from an Analysis of Diffusion Patterns,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"The unification of Europe offers major opportunities for firms providing products and services to the consumer market of nearly 400 million people. To capitalize effectively on these opportunities, firms must comprehend fully the changing macroenvironmental and consumer behavior trends in the European Union (EU). Recent research indicates that, though individual member countries differ substantially, convergence is increasing in the EU market. This observation requires a major revision in the marketing strategies of most firms; Pan-European marketing may be the name of the game for the future. This study empirically investigates changing consumer trends in the EU by comparing diffusion rates for new products introduced during the first and second half of the unification process. Managerial implications are drawn on the basis of the research findings.",0
Understanding the Customer Base of Service Providers: An Examination of the Differences between Switchers and Stayers,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Creating and maintaining customer loyalty has become a strategic mandate in today's service markets. Recent research suggests that customers differ in their value to a firm, and therefore customer retention and loyalty-building efforts should not necessarily be targeted to all customers of a firm. Given these sentiments, it is becoming increasingly necessary for firms to have a thorough understanding of their customer base. Yet current knowledge is limited in providing insights to firms regarding the differences within their customer base. This research comprises two studies in which the authors examine the differences among internal customer groups in a service industry. As theory suggests and as is empirically validated here, customers who have switched service providers because of dissatisfaction seem to differ significantly from other customer groups in their satisfaction and loyalty behaviors. The findings offer some interesting implications for both marketing theory and practice.",0
Market Share Performance of Foreign and Domestic Brands in China,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"In this study, the authors examine market share performance of foreign and domestic brands in China. Drawing on the resource-based view and brand management literature, they investigate the impacts of three sets of factors: brands? competitive advantages, external market environments, and the length of brand existence. The authors also examine the different influences of these factors on foreign versus domestic brands. The empirical testing is based on a survey of senior executives of 408 brands in 52 product categories in China. This study offers new findings on what drives the market share performance in transition economies.",0
The Differential Effect of Local?Global Identity Among Males and Females: The Case of Price Sensitivity,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors examine how gender identity and local?global identity?two important consumer identities and segmentation bases?affect consumer price sensitivity. These identities may be associated with similar behavioral norms such that a female identity and a local identity are associated with the norms of small groups and intimate relationships, whereas a male identity and a global identity are associated with the norms of large groups and broad relationships. Thus, a female identity and a global (vs. local) identity, as is the case with a male identity and a local (vs. global) identity, results in identity incongruence (vs. congruence). The authors argue that identity incongruence depletes cognitive resources and induces affective processing, which in turn activates a sacrifice mindset and results in lower price sensitivity. Five studies with different research designs, divergent measures of key constructs, and diverse samples support the theories and identify boundary conditions of the focal relationship. The findings expand the literature on multiple consumer identities and price sensitivity and provide useful guidelines for global companies? pricing strategies.",1
Toward a Yin-Yang Balancing Perspective of Relational (Guanxi) Gatekeeping in International Exchange Relationships in China,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"China is an extremely complex and ?insider-controlled? market for foreign businesses. This study offers a yin-yang balancing perspective of international exchange relationships in China. The authors investigate how ?relational gatekeepers? play a key role in achieving a dynamic balance between Western companies and local partners in international exchange relationships. In-depth interviews are conducted with 41 business managers based in China, Australia, and New Zealand. Guided by the yin-yang balancing frame, the authors develop four key constructs of relational gatekeeping: the gatekeeper resources of mianzi (insider status) and renqing (insider favor) and the gatekeeper capabilities of zao shi (creating favorable momentum) and ying shi (leveraging favorable momentum). The yin-yang frame provides a process view of business relationships that accepts paradoxical conditions and embraces dynamic network momentum, resources, and capabilities. The study concludes by showing the theoretical implications for network theory and for the field of dynamic balancing and suggests the managerial implications for an international company aiming to engage relational gatekeepers to break into insider (guanxi)-controlled local business networks.",0
Social Media Ties Strategy in International Branding: An Application of Resource-Based Theory,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Despite the prominence of social media (SM) in global branding, no prior studies have evaluated an international brand's strategy of establishing market-based relational ties with SM users in local markets. This study draws from the resource-based theory to conceptualize SM ties as latent relational resources and evaluate an international brand's SM ties strategy on the basis of three resource attributes: value, inimitability, and rarity. Whereas value is the initial basis for a relational resource in SM, inimitability and rarity are the foci of an international brand's strategy in local SM networks. The authors interviewed brand managers and SM users in China and New Zealand and conducted direct observations on brands? SM sites. They develop two theoretical frameworks (one initial; one advanced) to offer insights into the development of brand?user ties as a relational resource in the context of an international brand's global or foreign consumer culture positioning in a host-country market. The authors conclude that combined incentives offered in SM must be tailored to the type of brand?user tie.",0
Should Ad Spending Increase or Decrease before a Recall Announcement? The Marketing?Finance Interface in Product-Harm Crisis Management,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Product recalls tend to damage the stock price of the recalling firm. This article proposes and empirically demonstrates that adjustments to prerecall advertising spending can be used as a tool to moderate this financial damage. Using data on automobile recalls and detailed advertising expenditures from 2005 to 2012, the authors show that adjustments to a firm's prerecall advertising expenditure can either mitigate or amplify the negative effect of the recall on stock market value, depending on the direction of advertising adjustment and the recall characteristics. Boosting ad spending before a recall announcement softens the stock price loss when the recall involves a newly introduced product with a minor hazard but sharpens the loss when the recalled product is an established model with a major hazard. Cutting prerecall advertising worsens the stock price loss when the recall involves a new product, regardless of the hazard. This research also reveals that in product-harm crisis management, profit maximization and shareholder value maximization can conflict with each other, underscoring the importance of developing an integrated crisis management strategy.",0
Spillover of Distrust from Domestic to Imported Brands in a Crisis-Sensitized Market,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Spillover of distrust from domestic brands to foreign brands during an industry-wide scandal is an important but overlooked issue in the international marketing domain. Drawing on assimilation/contrast and attribution theories, the authors develop a general model of trust erosion in a multibrand product-harm crisis involving three brand categories: focal (domestic) brands, contrasting (imported) brands, and hybrid (manufactured domestically but with foreign brand names) brands. Assimilative associations in an epidemic-like crisis erode trust throughout the entire product category, whereas contrastive associations protect or even benefit a competing brand category from the brand damage. A survey of 2,156 consumers in nine metropolitan centers in China measured trust in brands of dairy products after the 2008 milk contamination crisis. This study reveals the roles of category distinctness, focal versus contrasting categories, category hybridity, brand prototypicality, perceived crisis severity, and perceived category typicality in moderating the assimilation/contrast effects in such a crisis. These findings have important managerial implications: international marketers should be wary of the risks in having their brand associated with products manufactured domestically in a market such as China.",0
How Does Local?Global Identity Affect Price Sensitivity?,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The authors propose that when consumers? local identity is accessible, they are less likely to be price sensitive because of a sacrifice mindset. Six studies using divergent measures of the independent and dependent variables as well as diverse samples (students and nonstudents, U.S. and Chinese residents, primary and secondary data) produce consistent results. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the mediating role of a sacrifice mindset by both measuring and manipulating this construct; they also identify boundary conditions of the association between a consumer's local identity and price sensitivity. Previous research has shown that consumers with a local identity display lower price sensitivity to brands with a local origin. In contrast, the results from this research show that consumers with a local identity display lower price sensitivity even to products with an ambiguous origin. Firms using a globalization strategy can try to activate consumers? local identity to make them less price sensitive to their brands, without having to position the brands as local.",0
The Influence of Initial Possession Level on Consumers' Adoption of a Collection Goal: A Tipping Point Effect,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Previous research has typically treated collection as a top-down process and focused on its later stages. However, collections may start by accident and are often triggered by incidental, bottom-up factors. The authors propose that a small number of possessions (i.e., a few more than one) represent an unjustified and, thus, unstable possession level that prompts a status change. They examine the collection tipping point at which obtaining items belonging to a series (e.g., a couple of collectible Coke cans) often gives rise to a decision to start a collection. Consumers then seek additional items to fulfill their emerging goal. In six lab studies and one field study, the authors investigate the tipping point at which a collection ?project? begins and explore the psychological processes underlying that tipping point. In addition, they discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of this research.",0
How Do Multinational Suppliers Formulate Mechanisms of Global Account Coordination? An Integrative Framework and Empirical Study,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Existing global account management (GAM) studies mostly focus on multinational suppliers? decision on which customers to serve with GAM programs, while paying limited attention to how to formulate mechanisms of global account coordination to best serve a chosen account. The issue of making optimal choices on specific coordination modes is pressing to global account managers because GAM programs are both costly and consequential. First, building on prior research that suggests the existence of two modes of global account coordination?namely, interorganizational coordination (IOC) and intercountry coordination (ICC)?the authors propose a formal framework that delineates their similarities and differences along the domain (internal vs. external), level (horizontal vs. vertical), and foci (strategic execution vs. relationship maintenance). Second, following the resource-based view and power-dependency theory, the authors propose an integrative framework on how various supplier, interorganizational, and customer factors influence global marketing managers? coordination mechanism choices. They further advance several hypotheses on the curvi-linear nature of influences of several antecedents on coordination mode choices and examine the impacts of forms of global account coordination modes on suppliers? market and relational performance. They test the conceptual model using data collected from a cross-national sample of more than 200 global account managers. The findings show that the two coordination modes have different sets of antecedents and exert independent, different influences on supplier performance. Therefore, they should be treated separately in research as well as practice.",0
Branding Cultural Products in International Markets: A Study of Hollywood Movies in China,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Cultural products are a major component of the world economy and are responsible for a growing share of U.S. exports. The authors examine brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign countries. Incorporating the unique characteristics of these products, the authors develop a theoretical framework that integrates similarity, which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name translations. The authors analyze Hollywood movies shown in China from 2011 to 2018. The results show that higher similarity leads to higher Chinese box office revenue, and this effect is stronger for movies that perform better in the home market (i.e., the United States). When the translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for Hollywood movies with greater cultural gap in the Chinese market. Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest when the movie is released and reduce over time. This research provides valuable guidance to companies, managers, and policy makers in cultural product industries as well as those in international marketing.",0
EXPRESS: Popping the Positive Illusion of Financial Responsibility Can Increase Personal Savings: Applications in Emerging and Western Markets,Journal of Marketing,2020,"People around the world are not saving enough money. We propose that one reason people under-save is because they hold the positive illusion of being financially responsible. If this conjecture is correct, then deflating this inflated self-view may increase saving, as people should become motivated to restore perceptions of financial responsibility. After establishing that people do hold the illusion of financial responsibility, we developed an intervention that combats this self-enhancing bias by triggering people to recognize their frequent engagement in superfluous spending. This superfluous-spender intervention increased saving by enhancing people?s motivation to restore their diminished perceptions of financial responsibility. Consistent with theorizing, the intervention increased saving only when superfluous spending was under one?s control and among those who were motivated to perceive themselves as financially responsible. In addition to increasing saving in Western countries, the superfluous-spender intervention increased saving of earned income and a financial windfall over time amongst chronically poor coffee growers in rural Uganda. Collectively, this work shows that people view their financial responsibility through rose-colored glasses which, in turn, can undermine their financial well-being. It also endows stakeholders with a simple, practical, and inexpensive intervention that offsets this bias to increase personal savings.",0
Social Effects in the In-Flight Marketplace: Characterization and Managerial Implications,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This article investigates the in-flight marketplace, using detailed data of in-flight purchases to understand social effects in purchase behavior and determine their potential for designing marketing promotions. On average, a passenger is approximately 30% more likely to buy an item after being exposed to a lateral purchase. Analyses on the underlying mechanisms reveal that the classical social influence theories do not suffice to explain all the patterns in the data. The author proposes omission neglect, product contagion, and goal balancing as complementary theories. Finally, consumers? willingness to buy is shown to be positively correlated with responsiveness to social influence. This finding indicates that homophily and social feedback effects?classically viewed in the literature as nuisances?can provide targeting value for the firm. By taking these factors into account during behavior-based targeting, firms can double the social spillovers of marketing actions.",1
The Influence of Incidental Affect on Consumers? Food Intake,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Although incidental affect has been shown to influence both attitude and purchase behavior, it has not been extended to actual consumption. This research investigates whether specific affective states influence food consumption and whether this influence is moderated by factors such as information and the nature of the product (hedonic versus less hedonic). The authors show that an integrative mood management and mood evaluation framework accounts for this relationship more effectively than a self-regulation explanation. A preliminary test and two lab studies show that people eat larger amounts of hedonic foods (buttered popcorn and M&M's) when they are in a sad state than when they are in a happy state and that this effect is attenuated when nutritional information is present. In contrast, they tend to eat larger amounts of a less hedonic product (raisins) when they are in a happy state than when they are in a sad state. The authors discuss implications for responsible marketers, health professionals, and health conscious consumers in the context of campaigns and individual efforts.",0
Growing Existing Customers? Revenue Streams through Customer Referral Programs,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Customer referral programs are an effective means of customer acquisition. By assessing a large-scale customer data set from a global cellular telecommunications provider, the authors show that participation in a referral program also increases existing customers? loyalty. In a field experiment, recommenders? defection rates fell from 19% to 7% within a year, and their average monthly revenue grew by 11.4% compared with a matched control group. A negative interaction between referral program participation and customer tenure reveals that the loyalty effect of voicing a recommendation is particularly pronounced for newer customer?firm relationships. A laboratory experiment further demonstrates that referral programs with larger rewards strengthen attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, whereas smaller rewards affect only the behavioral dimension. This article contributes to our theoretical understanding of the roles played by the commitment?consistency principle and positive reinforcement theory as mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of customer referral programs.",0
The Role of Spokescharacters as Advertisement and Package Cues in Integrated Marketing Communications,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Marketers often use verbal claims to highlight brand benefits in marketing communication campaigns. However, spokescharacters may also be incorporated into campaigns and are often featured both in advertisements and on product packages. The authors use three studies to examine various integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategic combinations, including the effects related to the use of spokescharacters versus verbal attributes; advertisement?package coordination; character relevancy; and the presence of new, favorable brand information that may compete for cognitive resources on packages. Based on conceptual rationales drawn from encoding specificity, network associations, and the elaboration likelihood model, the findings offer empirical evidence that pertains to the potential benefits of including spokescharacters in IMC campaigns. Specifically, the use of spokescharacters results in more favorable brand attitudes, even when brand attribute recall is affected adversely by deviations from the primary message conveyed in the IMC campaigns. The authors offer some implications of these and other findings for marketers attempting to affect consumer evaluations favorably with spokescharacters in IMC campaigns.",0
"The Jilting Effect: Antecedents, Mechanisms, and Consequences for Preference",Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This research explores how the experience of a jilt?the anticipation and subsequent inaccessibility of a highly desirable, aspirant option?influences preference for incumbent and non-incumbent options. The authors conceptualize jilting as a multi-stage process, which consists of a pre-jilt anticipatory phase that is initiated on the introduction of an aspirant option and a post-jilt phase that is initiated when the aspirant option becomes inaccessible. They show that during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response. During the affectively charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect. In four field and laboratory studies, the authors establish this jilting effect, rule out alternative accounts, and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.",1
Marketing Complex Financial Products in Emerging Markets: Evidence from Rainfall Insurance in India,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Recent financial liberalization in emerging economies has led to the rapid introduction of new financial products. Lack of experience with financial products, low levels of education, and low financial literacy may slow adoption of these products. This article reports on a field experiment that offered an innovative new financial product, rainfall insurance, to 600 small-scale farmers in India. A customized financial literacy and insurance education module communicating the need for personal financial management and the usefulness of formal hedging of agricultural production risks was offered to randomly selected farmers in Gujarat, India. The authors evaluate the effect of the financial literacy training and three marketing treatments using a randomized controlled trial. Financial education has a positive and significant effect on rainfall insurance adoption, increasing take-up from 8% to 16%. Only one marketing intervention, the money-back guarantee, has a consistent and large effect on farmers? purchase decisions. This guarantee, comparable to a price reduction of approximately 40%, increases demand by seven percentage points.",1
The Temporal and Spatial Dimensions of Price Search: Insights from Matching Household Survey and Purchase Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Price promotions are pervasive in grocery markets. A household can respond to price promotions by effectively cherry-picking through (1) spatial price search across stores and (2) temporal price search across time. However, extant research has analyzed these two dimensions of price search only separately and therefore underestimates both the consumer response to price promotions and the impact of promotions on retail profit. In this article, the authors introduce an integrated analysis of spatial and temporal price search. They seek answers to three questions: First, what are the predictors of household decisions to perform either spatial or temporal price search? Second, how effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with observed purchase data to address these questions. Their key results are as follows: Geography (the spatial configuration of store and household locations) and opportunity costs are useful predictors of a household's price search pattern. Households that claim to search spatiotemporally avail approximately three-quarters of the available savings on average. Households that search only temporally save about the same as those that search only spatially. The negative effect of cherry-picking on retailer profits is not as high as is typically believed.",1
"Creating a Market Orientation: A Longitudinal, Multifirm, Grounded Analysis of Cultural Transformation",Journal of Marketing,2006,"Market orientation is a foundation of marketing and is increasingly important in other fields, such as strategic management. Research in marketing has identified the characteristics of market-oriented organizations. However, how organizations change to become more market oriented has received less attention. In this article, the authors conduct an in-depth, longitudinal, multifirm investigation of firms that have successfully created a market orientation. Grounded by this in-depth understanding, they develop a theoretical model to explain how firms create a market orientation. The model identifies four path-dependent stages of change. In contrast to current conceptualizations, the authors find that creating a market orientation requires dramatic changes to an organization's culture and the creation of organizationally shared market understandings. The findings offer new insights into how organizations develop a greater market orientation, organizational change, and the nature of market orientation, including the role of intraorganizational power and organizational learning in creating and sustaining a market orientation.",0
Market Intelligence Dissemination Practices,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Market intelligence is a cornerstone of the marketing concept and essential to market-focused strategic planning and implementation. Although the importance of market intelligence is widely accepted, how managers can ensure the organization-wide generation, dissemination, and responsiveness to market intelligence remains a persistent challenge. In this article, the authors investigate market intelligence dissemination practices and their resulting managerial responses. Using qualitative methods, the authors identify five market intelligence dissemination practices that either update and reinforce organization members? existing schemas (mental models) of the market or create new, shared schemas of the market. Specifically, they find that the creation, existence, or absence of organizationally shared market schemas is crucial in explaining the effectiveness of different market intelligence dissemination practices. Thus, in addition to being experts on market intelligence, intelligence directors must be authorities on organizational learning and ways to create shared meaning structures that enable disseminated intelligence to be understood and used within their organizations. The authors conclude with suggestions for practitioners on how to manage intelligence dissemination across their organizations more effectively and efficiently.",0
Talk Bursts: The Role of Spikes in Prerelease Word-of-Mouth Dynamics,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Before their launch, many new products generate word of mouth (WOM) on social media. Such WOM typically increases toward the release date and contains sudden spikes. These spikes capture manifestations of peak consumer attention and are therefore of managerial importance, yet they have not received research attention. This article is the first to provide a comprehensive descriptive treatment of WOM spikes. The authors propose a conceptual framework to present spikes as a standalone WOM dimension and explain their emergence. They employ a robust filtering procedure to detect spikes and apply it in a data set of 90,000 prerelease online WOM messages on 157 Hollywood movies. The results indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details than is WOM outside spikes. Prerelease WOM spikes also contribute significantly to the predictability of future product sales.",1
"International Marketing Involvement: The Construct, Dimensionality, and Measurement",Journal of International Marketing,1995,"The growing importance of international marketing operations for the survival and success of an increasing number of businesses underscores the need to understand their involvement in these activities. To this end, this article proposes an eclectic and multidimensional definition as well as a new measure of international marketing involvement where equity, administrative, and operational components represent the three distinct behavioral means that can be utilized by a business to perform foreign marketing activities. Based upon a field study conducted in the United States of 45 firms and 78 product market units, evidence is supportive of the internal consistency and construct validity of the proposed measure of international marketing involvement (IMI).",0
Norms- and Control-Based Governance of International Manufacturer?Distributor Relational Exchanges,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This study contributes to an understanding of plural forms of governance by integrating research on norms-based and control-based mechanisms in managing interorganizational relationships. The authors develop a model of structural antecedents and performance consequences of these two distinct governance forms. Based on data from 129 relationships between U.S. manufacturers and foreign-based independent distributors, the empirical results show a differential effect of relationship structures on the use of control-based and norms-based governance. Furthermore, the results show that these governance forms have distinct performance implications, and the nature of their influence on the effectiveness of the relationship varies by the environmental uncertainty in the foreign markets.",0
The Effect of Export Assistance Program Usage on Export Performance: A Contingency Explanation,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"On the basis of a synthesis of prior research, the authors develop a model, which integrates export marketing involvement and the use of government export promotion assistance programs as critical variables affecting export performance, and subject it to empirical evaluation. In this context, the authors also investigate organizational and managerial differences among the firms involved in export marketing to ascertain the robustness of and replicate the observed differences in firms? export marketing involvement behavior. The results indicate that export marketing involvement of firms and firms? usage of government export assistance programs are important export success factors. However, the relevance of export assistance programs and the role they play vary depending on the dimension of export performance being considered.",0
Profiting from Partial Allowance of Ticket Resale,Journal of Marketing,2007,"For a seller that markets event tickets both in advance and on spot, a concern is that ticket resale may hurt its profitability. The conventional wisdom is for the seller to consider completely banning resale if possible. This article considers an alternative strategy in which resale is only partially restricted; specifically, resale is banned on spot but still allowed in advance. Using a two-period model in which buyers have discreet valuations, the authors show that it is possible for partial resale to outperform no resale (and also unrestricted resale at the other extreme) in terms of seller profitability when the following conditions hold: when the seller has limited capacity, when the number of high-valuation buyers is small enough, and when the number of early arrivers is not too large. An implication of this research is that when consumers conduct advance and spot resale in different channels, such as advance resale online and spot resale offline, the seller may be better off adopting different resale policies for different channels.",0
The Chief Marketing Officer Matters!,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Marketing academics and practitioners alike remain unconvinced about the chief marketing officer's (CMO's) performance implications. Whereas some studies propose that firms benefit financially from having a CMO in the C-suite, other studies conclude that the CMO has little or no effect on firm performance. Accordingly, there have been strong calls for additional academic research regarding the CMO's performance implications. In response to these calls, the authors employ model specifications with varying identifying assumptions (i.e., rich data models, unobserved effects models, instrumental variable models, and panel internal instruments models) and use data from up to 155 publicly traded firms over a 12-year period (2000?2011) to find that firms can indeed expect to benefit financially from having a CMO at the strategy table. Specifically, their findings suggest that the performance (measured in terms of Tobin's q) of the sample firms that employ a CMO is, on average, approximately 15% greater than that of the sample firms that do not employ a CMO. This result is robust to the type of model specification used. Marketing academics and practitioners should find the results intriguing given the existing uncertainty surrounding the CMO's performance implications. The study also contributes to the methodology literature by collating diverse empirical model specifications that can be used to model causal effects with observational data into a coherent and comprehensive framework.",0
What Makes It Green? The Role of Centrality of Green Attributes in Evaluations of the Greenness of Products,Journal of Marketing,2015,"An increasing body of research addresses consumers' green product purchasing behavior, and yet little work has examined how consumers form perceptions of the greenness of products in the first place. Drawing on theories of attribute centrality (the degree to which an attribute is integral in defining an object), the authors argue that products with identical environmental benefits will be judged more or less green depending on whether the benefit stems from a central versus a peripheral attribute. They present four studies that support the hypotheses and explore factors that influence the effect of central attributes, including product category membership and integration of the green attribute with other elements of the product. They include controls for firm motivations and importance of the attribute to the individual consumer. The authors conclude the article with managerial and public policy implications, such as advice for firms on where to make green investments for maximum consumer impact and insight for public policy makers on the need for consumer assistance in objectively evaluating products with identical environmental benefits that achieve those benefits in different ways.",0
Why Prosocial Referral Incentives Work: The Interplay of Reputational Benefits and Action Costs,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Selfish incentives typically outperform prosocial incentives, and customer referral programs frequently use such ?selfish? (i.e., sender-benefiting) incentives to incentivize current customers to recruit new customers. However, in two field experiments and a fully incentivized lab experiment, this research finds that ?prosocial? (i.e., recipient-benefiting) referral incentives recruit more new customers. Five subsequent experiments test a process account for this effect, identifying two key psychological mechanisms: reputational benefits and action costs. First, at the referral stage, senders (existing customers) anticipate reputational benefits for referring recipients (potential new customers), who receive a reward for signing up. These reputational benefits render recipient-benefiting referrals just as effective as sender-benefiting referrals at the relatively low-cost referral stage. Second, at the uptake stage, recipient-benefiting referrals are more effective than sender-benefiting referrals: recipient-benefiting referrals directly incentivize recipients to sign up, providing a clear reward for an otherwise costly uptake decision. The preponderance of selfish, or sender-benefiting, referral incentives in the marketplace suggests these effects are unanticipated by marketers who design incentive schemes.",1
The Market Valuation of Internet Channel Additions,Journal of Marketing,2002,"The emergence of the Internet has pushed many established companies to explore this radically new distribution channel. Like all market discontinuities, the Internet creates opportunities as well as threats?it can be performance-enhancing as readily as it can be performance-destroying. Making use of event-study methodology, the authors assess the net impact of adding an Internet channel on a firm's stock market return, a measure of the change in expected future cash flows. The authors find that, on average, Internet channel investments are positive net-present-value investments. The authors then identify firm, introduction strategy, and marketplace characteristics that influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. The results indicate that powerful firms with a few direct channels are expected to achieve greater gains in financial performance than are less powerful firms with a broader direct channel offering. In terms of order of entry, early followers have a competitive advantage over both innovators and later followers, even when time of entry is controlled for. The authors also find that Internet channel additions that are supported by more publicity are perceived as having a higher performance potential.",0
Proliferating Private-Label Portfolios: How Introducing Economy and Premium Private Labels Influences Brand Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Three-tiered private-label (PL) portfolio strategies (low-quality tier: economy PLs, mid-quality tier: standard PLs, and top-quality tier: premium PLs) are gaining interest around the world. Drawing on the context-effects literature, the authors postulate how the introduction of economy and premium PLs may affect the choice of mainstream-quality and premium-quality national brands (NBs) and the choice of the retailer's existing PL offering. The authors use the natural experiment offered by Asda's and Sainsbury's introduction of economy and premium PL tiers in the corn flakes and canned soup categories in the United Kingdom to test their framework. Using brand choice models that accommodate context (compromise, similarity, and attraction) effects, the authors find that both economy and premium PLs cannibalize incumbent PLs. Economy PL introductions benefit mainstream-quality NBs because these NBs become a compromise or middle option in terms of quality in the retailer's assortment. The effects of premium PL introductions on premium-quality NBs are mixed: Their share improves in two of four cases but decreases in the other two cases.",1
United We Stand: The Impact of Buying Groups on Retailer Productivity,Journal of Marketing,2015,"In diverse industries, from grocery retailing to health care, retailers join buying groups to achieve better terms with suppliers. The authors track the buying group membership of Europe's largest grocery retailers over a 15-year period and evaluate why some buying groups are better than others in increasing retailer performance and why different members belonging to the same group do not always benefit equally from their membership. They find that, on average, buying groups indeed generate scale advantages for their members: group scale increases group members' productivity and sales and decreases their cost of goods sold. Still, bigger is not always better. Retailers benefit less from buying group scale when the group is more heterogeneous in terms of member size and when it extends its scope across too many markets. Moreover, the smaller a member is within the group and the more it overlaps with fellow members, the less it benefits.",0
EXPRESS: Mobilizing the Temporary Organization: The Governance Roles of Selection and Pricing,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Many marketing transactions between buyers and suppliers involve short-term collaborations or so-called temporary organizations. Such organizations have considerable value-creation potential, but also face challenges, as evidenced by their mixed performance records. One particular challenge involves relationship governance, and in this respect, temporary organizations represent a conundrum: On the one hand, they pose significant governance problems, due to the need to manage numerous independent specialists under time constraints. At the same time, temporary organizations lack the inherent governance properties of other organizational forms like permanent organizations. The authors conduct an empirical study of 429 business-to-business (B2B) construction projects designed to answer two specific questions: First, how are particular selection and pricing strategies deployed in response to monitoring and coordination problems? Second, does the joint alignment between the two mechanisms and their respective attributes help mitigate cost overruns? We follow up our formal hypotheses tests with a series of in-depth interviews to explore and to gain insight into the validity of our key constructs, explanatory mechanisms, and outcomes. Managerially, the authors answer the long-standing question of how to mobilize a temporary organization. Theoretically, they develop an augmented ?discriminating alignment? heuristic for relationship management involving multiple governance mechanisms and attributes.",0
Customizing Complex Products: When Should the Vendor Take Control?,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Casual observation suggests that firms use contrasting practices and procedures when offering customized products to individual customers. Some firms take a ?hands-off? approach and let customers self-select their desired product. In contrast, other firms are proactively involved in designing customized solutions to individual customer needs. The authors call the former ?low vendor customization control? and the latter ?high vendor customization control.? Despite the strategic importance of customization, no research has shed light on the rationale for using these contrasting approaches to customization and their normative consequences. The authors develop a conceptual model that contends that the appropriate level of vendor control over the customization decision is a function of technology and knowledge considerations. They use data on 304 procurement arrangements for customized products to test their hypotheses and to explore the normative ramifications for three key measures of performance: closeness of the delivered product to customer needs, delivery performance, and the vendor's operating profits. The results show that contracting parties choose the level of vendor control over customization in a strategic and discriminating way to enhance the benefits from customization for both parties. The authors discuss implications for both theory and practice.",1
Strategic Fit in Industrial Alliances: An Empirical Test of Governance Value Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The exclusion of firm-specific considerations in the standard (economizing calculus) approach to buyer?supplier ties makes the large variations in the types of contracts used within the same industry unexplainable. This article tests Ghosh and John's (1999) strategizing calculus model that purports to close this gap. The core organizing principle of this model is a three-way fit among firm resources, investments, and governance that yields the highest net receipts. From this principle, the authors derive predictions and test them using data from 193 original equipment manufacturers that engage independent component suppliers. The data show that investments must be aligned with more complete contract terms (e.g., fixed prices, ?hard? designs) to yield cost reduction outcomes for all firms. However, investments must be aligned with more incomplete contracts (e.g., cost-plus prices, ?soft? designs) to yield end-product enhancement outcomes, but only for firms with relatively small downstream market margins. Firms with larger downstream market margins find that the previous alignment reduces end-product enhancements. These results are robust to checks for common method bias and alternative estimation procedures. The authors discuss practical guidelines for the desired tightness of supplier contract terms from the three-way fit principle.",1
When Should Original Equipment Manufacturers Use Branded Component Contracts with Suppliers?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Branded components are becoming increasingly popular in industrial markets; yet extant research provides limited understanding of the use of such arrangements in the real world. The authors use the governance lens of transaction cost economics to propose that leveraging the vendor's brand reputation and safeguarding the vendor's customization investments are key motivators for choosing branded component contracts. Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and when the component supplier has made significant component customization investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the ?wrong? contract form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in nature. In particular, choosing a ?white box? contract when the theory argues for a branded component contract leads to more adverse outcomes than choosing a branded component contract when the theory predicts a ?white box? contract. Finally, the authors draw key conclusions for theory and managerial practice.",1
Multiple Reference Points in Sequential Hedonic Evaluation: An Empirical Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Marketers frequently offer a variety of communications, brands, and service encounters that customers evaluate sequentially. When customers make these evaluations, their previous experiences in the sequence influence their current evaluation. The authors propose that these prior experiences serve as multiple reference points against which the target stimulus is judged, creating rival co-occurring comparison effects. Using real-world and experimental data, they find that assimilation and contrast effects occur simultaneously: there is assimilation to the first score within a sequence and contrast with the immediate predecessor as well as with extremes experienced earlier in the sequence. The authors document the moderating effects of extreme first stimuli, domain similarity, and individual factors of mood and expertise. They provide different recommendations for sequence construction on the basis of whether the marketer's goal is fairness, accuracy, or influencing choice. This research is unique in (1) showing how several preceding evaluations can each have an impact on a subsequent evaluation at the same time and (2) using real-world data to do so.",1
Adjusting the Warm-Glow Thermostat: How Incentivizing Participation in Voluntary Green Programs Moderates Their Impact on Service Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing,2016,"In Study 1, the authors find that people are more satisfied with a service experience when they choose to participate in the provider's voluntary green program (e.g., recycling)?an effect mediated by the ?warm glow? of participation. The downside, however, is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2, analysis of data from the J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e., compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that, compared with no incentive, an ?other-benefiting? incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4, however, suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e., providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options) maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups?the ideal outcome for managers.",0
Touch versus Tech: When Technology Functions as a Barrier or a Benefit to Service Encounters,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Interpersonal exchanges between customers and frontline service employees increasingly involve the use of technology, such as point-of-sale terminals, tablets, and kiosks. The present research draws on role and script theories to demonstrate that customer reactions to technology-infused service exchanges depend on the presence of employee rapport. When rapport is present during the exchange, the use of technology functions as an interpersonal barrier preventing the customer from responding in kind to employee rapport-building efforts, thereby decreasing service encounter evaluations. However, during service encounters in which employees are not engaging in rapport building, technology functions as an interpersonal barrier, enabling customers to retreat from the relatively unpleasant service interaction, thereby increasing service encounter evaluations. Two analyses using J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index data support the barrier and beneficial effects of technology use during service encounters with and without rapport, respectively. A follow-up experiment replicates this data pattern and identifies psychological discomfort as a key process that governs the effect. For managers, the results demonstrate the inherent incompatibility of initiatives designed to encourage employee?customer rapport with those that introduce technology into frontline service exchanges.",0
New Products: The Antidote to Private Label Growth?,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"As private labels (PLs) continue to grow in power and market share, product innovation has become one of the strongest weapons in the national brand (NB) manufacturer's arsenal. In this article, the author assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers. Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage benefits.",1
The Entry Strategy of Retail Firms into Transition Economies,Journal of Marketing,2007,"International entries into transition economies occur infrequently and involve considerable uncertainty. This raises the question whether managers, who have limited own experience, take their competitors' prior decisions into account when deciding on their own entry timing and size and whether there is value in doing so. To address these questions, the authors estimate a sequential hazard/Poisson regression model on the top 75 European grocery retailers' decisions to enter the Eastern European market. Indeed, firms pay close attention to prevailing practices in their industry. Prior entries first serve as legitimation but eventually become a deterring factor. Moreover, rather than just imitating the most popular or modal decision when determining the own entry timing and size, managers pay closer attention to the actions of their home competitors, react to prior entries of same-format competitors differently from those of different-format competitors, and adjust the observed industry practice for the specificity of their own resources. The authors show that managers are justified in taking the combined industry wisdom into account; deviations from prevailing industry practice, in terms of both timing and size, hurt the efficiency of their operations in subsequent years. Thus, attempts to develop own, distinct entry rules tend to be dysfunctional. Moreover, corrective actions are easier to implement along the size than along the time dimension; the detrimental effects of entering at a different time from the industry norm persist and even become amplified over time, whereas the negative impact of size deviations is temporary.",0
The New Regulator in Town: The Effect of Walmart's Sustainability Mandate on Supplier Shareholder Value,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Suppliers are increasingly being forced by dominant retailers to clean up their supply chains. These retailers argue that their sustainability mandates may translate into profits for suppliers, but many suppliers are cynical about these mandates because the onus to undertake the required investments is on them while potential gains may be usurped by the mandating retailer. We examine whether supplier fears are justified by studying the impact of Walmart's sustainability mandate on its suppliers? (short-term) shareholder value. Although about two-thirds of suppliers are indeed financially harmed, approximately one-third benefit. To delve deeper into this variation, we relate suppliers? short-term abnormal returns to Walmart's appropriation power and explore whether and to what extent a supplier's referent and expert power sources, derived from its marketing and operational characteristics, respectively, can counteract Walmart's appropriation attempts. We find that the supplier's marketing characteristics (its environmental reputation, brand equity, and advertising) provide it with the countervailing power needed to resist Walmart's appropriation attempts. In contrast, cost-efficient suppliers and suppliers that invest heavily in R&D have more difficulty withstanding Walmart's squeeze attempts.",0
Navigating the Last Mile: The Demand Effects of Click-and-Collect Order Fulfillment,Journal of Marketing,2020,Many retailers are rushing into the click-and-collectÿ(C the effects depend heavily on shopper characteristics. The study?s results provide guidance on which C&C fulfillment type(s) to operate under what conditions and caution retailers not to take the easy in-store route routinely.,0
Dancing with a Giant: The Effect of Wal-Mart's Entry into the United Kingdom on the Performance of European Retailers,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors examine the value-destroying and value-enhancing effects of a giant player's foreign entry on incumbents operating in that region. They use Wal-Mart's entry into the United Kingdom, through its acquisition of Asda, as the empirical context. Drawing on the marketing, strategy, and finance literature streams, the authors develop hypotheses as to why some incumbents are negatively affected whereas others actually may benefit from the entry of a giant competitor. Their measure of performance impact is the change in shareholder value around the announcement date, which has recently been recognized as an important metric to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing actions. The authors find strong support for the conceptual model, which distinguishes between the seriousness of the threat to the incumbents and their capacity to withstand the threat. The authors validate their findings using three alternative measures of company performance: percentage growth in the incumbent retailer's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and return on assets between 1998 (the year before the Asda takeover) and 2002 (three years after the takeover). The authors discuss various managerial implications of their results. By acting proactively, incumbents can mitigate the negative performance consequences, while maximally benefiting from the positive implications of a giant competitor's entry.",1
How Doppelgnger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Using actor-network theory from sociology, the author explores the creation of new markets as a brand-mediated legitimation process. Findings from an eight-year longitudinal investigation of the Botox Cosmetic brand suggest that the meanings of a new cosmetic self-enhancement technology evolve over the course of contestations between brand images promoted by the innovator and doppelgnger brand images promoted by other stakeholders. Each contestation addresses an enduring contradiction between nature and technology. A four-step brand image revitalization process is offered that can be applied either by managers interested in fostering an innovation's congruence with prevailing social norms and ideals or by other stakeholders (e.g., activists, competitors) interested in undermining its marketing success. The findings integrate previously disparate research streams on branding and market creation and provide managers with the conceptual tools for sustaining a branded innovation's legitimacy over time.",0
Riding the Waves: Revealing the Impact of Intrayear Category Demand Cycles on Advertising and Pricing Effectiveness,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Going beyond traditional seasonality, this research introduces the concept of the intrayear category demand cycle. This phenomenon reflects demand cycles most consumer packaged goods categories experience throughout the year, with periods of higher demand following periods of lower demand. The author argues that acknowledging the existence of these cycles and understanding their impact on both advertising and pricing effectiveness and practice is critical for marketers. Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these cycles for a unique set of 252 brands?ranging from high-advertising, high-priced ?premium mass? brands to low-advertising, low-priced ?value niche? brands?in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price increases remain unchanged. However, effectiveness evolutions and observed action patterns along these intrayear cycles are both markedly diverse across the different types of brands.",1
Losses Loom Longer than Gains: Modeling the Impact of Service Crises on Perceived Service Quality over Time,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Service providers sometimes face mass service failures. These problems occur across service industries, ranging from severe Internet outages to major delays for airlines or trains. The literature has not yet addressed the following key question: How do service crises affect perceived service quality (PSQ) over time? To answer this question, the authors introduce a Double-Asymmetric Structural Vector Autoregressive model. It captures not only the short- and long-term effects of objective service performance on PSQ but also the differential effects of service crises versus service restoration. The authors analyze a unique data set from a major European railway company, spanning seven years of monthly observations. During this period, severe winter weather caused dramatic service crises. The authors find that performance losses loom larger than gains in the short run and also have permanent negative effects on PSQ in the long run. Consequently, a crisis followed by a restoration will result in a net negative long-term effect on PSQ. The impact of a crisis also depends on the prior trend in objective service performance.",1
Models for Heterogeneous Variable Selection,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Preference heterogeneity is a major research stream in marketing aimed at quantifying and understanding the diversity of demand for product attributes and attribute levels. In experimental settings, in which consumers are presented with simple descriptions of product offerings, continuous distributions of heterogeneity, such as the multivariate normal, provide a useful representation of preference. However, in more complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that result in selective attention to a subset of the information available, continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different respondents. Identifying which attributes are used in a brand choice decision is closely related to the statistical procedure of variable selection. This article extends variable selection methods to accommodate heterogeneity across consumers and data contexts, conditions frequently encountered in marketing studies. The authors apply the methods to a discrete-choice conjoint study in which data are collected in both full-profile and partial-profile formats.",1
The Role of Within-Trip Dynamics in Unplanned versus Planned Purchase Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2015,"The recent surge in the importance of shopper marketing has led to an increased need to understand the drivers of unplanned purchases. The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",0
Posterior Predictive Model Checking: An Application to Multivariate Normal Heterogeneity,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Analysts fitting a hierarchical Bayesian model must specify the distribution of heterogeneity. There are several distributions to choose from, including the multivariate normal, mixture of normals, Dirichlet processes priors, and so forth. Although significant progress has been made, estimating the models and obtaining measures for model selection remain ongoing areas of research for more flexible distributions of heterogeneity. As a result, the multivariate normal remains the default choice for many researchers and software packages. This article proposes model-checking statistics that signal the adequacy of the multivariate normal assumption for the distribution of heterogeneity; these methods do not require the analyst to fit alternative models. The authors use posterior predictive model checking to determine whether a discrepancy exists between the individual-level parameters and those implied by the assumed distribution of heterogeneity. In simulated and real data sets, the results show that these statistics are useful for identifying when the multivariate normal distribution is adequate, when there is a departure in the tails of the distribution, and when a multimodal distribution of heterogeneity may be more appropriate.",1
Return on Engagement Initiatives: A Study of a Business-to-Business Mobile App,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Firms are increasingly offering engagement initiatives to facilitate firm?customer interactions or interactions among customers, with the primary goal of fostering emotional and psychological bonds between customers and the firm. Unlike traditional marketing interventions, which are designed to prompt sales, assessing returns on engagement initiatives (RoEI) is more complex because sales are not the primary goal and, often, direct sales are not associated with such initiatives. To assess RoEI across varying institutional contexts, the authors propose and empirically implement a methodological framework to investigate a business-to-business mobile app that a tool manufacturer provides for free to engage its buyers. The data include sales by buyer firms that adopted the app over 15 months, as well as a control group of buyers that did not adopt. The results from a difference-in-differences specification, together with selection on observables and unobservables, show that the app increased the manufacturer's annual sales revenues by 19.11%?22.79%; even after accounting for development costs, it resulted in positive RoEI. This RoEI was higher when buyers created more projects using the app, so customer participation intensity appears to underlie RoEI. This article contributes to engagement literature by providing a methodological framework and empirical evidence on how the benefits of engagement initiatives materialize.",0
Convergent Products: What Functionalities Add More Value to the Base?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Convergence in the electronics sector has enabled the addition of disparate new functionalities to existing base products (e.g., adding mobile television to a cell phone or Internet access to a personal digital assistant). This research investigates the role of two factors?(1) the goal congruence between the added functionality and the base and (2) the nature of the base product (utilitarian versus hedonic)?on the evaluation of such convergent products (CPs). The author proposes that the evaluation of CPs with a utilitarian versus hedonic base is subject to an asymmetric additivity effect. Specifically, whereas CPs with a utilitarian base gain more from adding an incongruent, hedonic functionality than a congruent, utilitarian one, CPs with a hedonic base gain less from an incongruent, utilitarian addition than a congruent, hedonic one. This asymmetry is because hedonic additions enhance the pleasure of using a utilitarian base, whereas utilitarian additions may dilute the existing hedonic image of a hedonic base. The moderating role of prior ownership of the base of a CP is also explored. The author proposes that the effects of goal congruence are stronger for owners than for nonowners, but only for CPs with a hedonic base, not for those with a utilitarian base. The author verifies the proposed effects in an experimental study conducted with a large-scale, representative sample of the target market population. Further research on other (moderating) factors affecting the evaluation of CPs is also suggested.",0
Protecting Global Brands: Toward a Global Norm,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"In 1995, the World Trade Organization bound member countries to new standards of foreign trademark protection. Developed countries were given a year to bring their national trademark regimes into compliance. Other countries were allowed from 5 to 11 years. In the past 7 years, governments have taken many steps to reach compliance. Nonetheless, many countries fall short of the envisaged global norm. To better understand the challenges of the past several years, the authors focus on the state of national trademark regimes on the eve of the establishment of the World Trade Organization. The authors particularly address how contagion influence, resource constraints, and xenophobia affected treaty participation, domestic trademark law, application processing, and the relative treatment of foreign and domestic applications. The authors analyze data for 62 countries, which suggest that distinct patterns of foreign trademark protection existed for developed countries, newly industrialized countries, less developed countries, and transitional economies. The authors explain the managerial implications of these findings and argue that there is evidence that countries are moving toward global norms in trademark protection. However, an international treaty is the beginning, not the end, of this process.",0
A Direct Approach to Data Fusion,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The generic data fusion problem is to make inferences about the joint distribution of two sets of variables without any direct observations of the joint distribution. Instead, information is available only for each set separately along with some other set of common variables. The standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without including the common variables. This is the object required for marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete variables is required. The authors develop a method for relaxing the assumption of conditional independence for this case. They illustrate their approach with product-purchase and media-viewing data from a large survey of British consumers.",1
Our Apples are Healthier than your Apples: Deciphering the Healthiness Bias for Domestic and Foreign Products,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"This study extends previous research by exploring perceptions of healthiness in the international food marketplace. To this end, it aims to fill an important gap by shedding light on the role of country of origin in shaping perceptions of healthiness. The authors provide evidence that domestic and foreign food products elicit different perceptions of healthiness. Consumers choose domestic products because they perceive them as healthier and more natural. The effect holds across different samples and product categories (apples, tomatoes, bread, and yogurt). However, this healthiness bias vanishes when products are presented as posing health risks and when products are introduced with a dual identity (i.e., both foreign and domestic). Researching these health-related effects helps provide a better understanding of consumer attitudes toward domestic- versus foreign-made food products.",0
Field Experimentation in Marketing Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Despite increasing efforts to encourage the adoption of field experiments in marketing research (e.g., Campbell 1969; Cialdini 1980; Li et al. 2015), the majority of scholars continue to rely primarily on laboratory studies (Cialdini 2009). For example, of the 50 articles published in Journal of Marketing Research in 2013, only three (6%) were based on field experiments. The goal of this article is to motivate a methodological shift in marketing research and increase the proportion of empirical findings obtained using field experiments. The author begins by making a case for field experiments and offers a description of their defining features. She then demonstrates the unique value that field experiments can offer and concludes with a discussion of key considerations that researchers should be mindful of when designing, planning, and running field experiments.",1
Enough Is Enough! The Fine Line in Executing Multichannel Relational Communication,Journal of Marketing,2011,"In an effort to build long-term, profitable relationships, many companies systematically engage in multichannel relational communication?personalized messages sent to existing customers through various channels as part of a broader relationship marketing strategy. In this research, the authors examine three key drivers of relational communication effectiveness: volume of communication, mix of communication channels, and alignment of those channels with customers? preferences. They hypothesize that customer response to relational communication follows a continuum in which reciprocity explains response to lower levels of communication, the classic ideal point describes a transition phase, and reactance explains response to higher levels of communication. They empirically test the theoretical framework by examining the impact of multichannel communication on repurchase over a three-year period. The results indicate that after the ideal level of communication is exceeded, customers react negatively. This negative response can be exacerbated by the use of multiple channels but attenuated by aligning channels with customer preferences. The findings suggest that the complex effects of multichannel communication can actually drive customers away from rather than closer to a company.",0
Tariff Choice with Consumer Learning and Switching Costs,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Consumers choosing flat-rate contracts tend to have insufficient usage to warrant the cost, particularly for new products. We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this flat-rate bias without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a ?winner's curse?: Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching costs deter them from changing tariffs. Using the estimated model, the authors find that tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by 20% when the per-use tariff is dropped, because more consumers choose and stay with the flat rate.",1
The Dynamics of a Marketing Orientation in Transition Economies: A Study of Russian Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article reports the results of a cross-sectional data collection in four Russian cities. The objective of the research is to ascertain whether, during the evolution of marketing in a transition to a free market, firms exhibit similar behaviors observed in well-established free-market economies. Structured interviews were conducted with 200 owner/managers of Russian firms. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether environmental turbulence results in a change in marketing orientation, ensuing use of marketing strategies, and improved firm performance. Although the model generally followed Western trends, there were important differences in the effectiveness of pricing and promotional strategies.",0
The Role of Hubs in the Adoption Process,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The authors explore the role of hubs (people with an exceptionally large number of social ties) in diffusion and adoption. Using data on a large network with multiple adoptions, they identify two types of hubs?innovative and follower hubs. Contrary to recent arguments, hubs tend to adopt earlier in the diffusion process, even though they are not necessarily innovative. Although innovative hubs have a greater impact on the speed of the adoption process, follower hubs have a greater impact on market size (total number of adoptions). Importantly, a small sample of hubs offers accurate success versus failure predictions early in the diffusion process.",0
Riding the Saddle: How Cross-Market Communications Can Create a Major Slump in Sales,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Using data on a large number of innovative products in the consumer electronics industry, the authors find that between one-third and one-half of the sales cases involved the following pattern: an initial peak, then a trough of sufficient depth and duration to exclude random fluctuations, and eventually sales levels that exceeded the initial peak. This newly identified pattern, which the authors call a ?saddle,? is explained by the dual-market phenomenon that differentiates between early market adopters and main market adopters as two separate markets. If these two segments?the early market and the main market?adopt at different rates, and if this difference is pronounced, then the overall sales to the two markets will exhibit a temporary decline at the intermediate stage. The authors employ both empirical analysis and cellular automata, an individual-level, complex system modeling technique for generating and analyzing data, to investigate the conditions under which a saddle occurs. The model highlights the importance of cross-market communication in determining the existence of a saddle. At low levels of this parameter, more than 50% of the cases of new product growth involved a saddle. This percentage gradually decreased as the parameter increased, and at values close to the within-market parameters, the proportion of saddle occurrences dropped below 5%.",0
The Quest for Content: How User-Generated Links can Facilitate Online Exploration,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Online content and products are presented as product networks, in which nodes are product pages linked by hyperlinks. These links are typically algorithmically induced recommendations based on aggregated data. Recently, websites have begun to offer social networks and user-generated links alongside the product network, creating a dual-network structure. The authors investigate the role of this dual-network structure in facilitating content exploration. They analyze YouTube's dual network and show that user pages have unique structural properties and act as content brokers. Next, the authors show that random rewiring of the product network cannot replicate this brokering effect. They present seven Internet studies in which participants browsing a YouTube-based website are exposed to different conditions of recommendations. The first set of studies shows that exposure to the dual network results in a more efficient (time to desirable outcome) and more effective (average product rating, overall satisfaction) exploration process. The next set of studies extends the previous ones to include dynamic structures, in which the network changes as a function of time or in response to participants' satisfaction. Furthermore, the results are replicated using data from another content site.",1
Historical Method in Marketing Research with New Evidence on Long-Term Market Share Stability,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Several researchers have advocated historical or longitudinal approaches to study marketing phenomena. Although some have applied this approach, more often it has been overlooked or denigrated. The author argues that historical method is capable of producing scientific knowledge that is currently useful, rather than simply a remembrance of the past. The author presents a complete description of the historical method, so researchers can use this article as a guide when applying this method. The value of the method is illustrated by examining the prevailing finding in the marketing literature that market shares are stable over time. Although this finding is considered an empirical generalization, an analysis of more than 650 brands in 100 categories raises doubts about the longevity of market share stability.",1
What is Quality? An Integrative Framework of Processes and States,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Quality is a central element in business strategy and academic research. Despite important research on quality, an opportunity for an integrative framework remains. The authors present an integrative framework of quality that captures how firms and customers produce quality (the quality production process), how firms deliver and customers experience quality (the quality experience process), and how customers evaluate quality (the quality evaluation process). The framework extends the literature in several ways. First, the authors describe important linkages between the three processes, including links reflecting the role of co-production. Second, they point to overlooked aspects of the quality processes that influence how quality is conceptualized and should be managed. These include customer heterogeneity in measurement knowledge and motivation; the role of emotion in quality production, experience, and evaluation; and a new typology of attributes. Third, they propose a quality state residing within each quality process and describe what gives rise to these states, which will enhance decision makers? ability to measure and manage quality processes. Finally, they offer theoretical and managerial implications derived from their integrative quality framework including 20 strategies to increase customer satisfaction.",0
Advertising Bans and the Substitutability of Online and Offline Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors examine whether the growth of the Internet has reduced the effectiveness of government regulation of advertising. They combine nonexperimental variation in local regulation of offline alcohol advertising with data from field tests that randomized exposure to online advertising for 275 different online advertising campaigns to 61,580 people. The results show that people are 8% less likely to say that they will purchase an alcoholic beverage in states that have alcohol advertising bans compared with states that do not. For consumers exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that have bans. This suggests that online advertising could reduce the effectiveness of attempts to regulate offline advertising channels because online advertising substitutes for (rather than complements) offline advertising.",1
Are All Managers Created Equal?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Some managers are better than others. Using the cognitive hierarchy framework of Camerer, Ho, and Chong (2004), the authors develop a structural econometric model that estimates the level of strategic thinking. In the model, firms with a high level of strategic thinking are more likely to correctly conjecture the expected actions of their competitors. The authors apply this model to decisions by managers at 2233 Internet service providers of whether to offer their customers access through 56K modems in 1997. The model is validated by showing that firms with a higher estimated probability of strategic thinking were more likely to have survived through April 2007. The estimation results show considerable heterogeneity in the degree to which firms behave strategically and suggest that strategic ability affects marketing outcomes; specifically, a simulated increase in strategic ability means that fewer firms offer the technology to their customers.",1
Can Uncertainty Improve Promotions?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Many consumer promotions involve uncertainty (e.g., purchase incentives offering the chance to receive one of several rewards). Despite retailers? heavy reliance on such promotions, much academic research on uncertainty has demonstrated examples of consumers avoiding and/or disliking uncertainty, implying that promotions involving uncertainty may not be as effective for retailers as promotions offering certain rewards. In an effort to reconcile the prevalence of uncertain promotions with the existing research, this article explores the conditions under which uncertain promotions may be effective for retailers. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications for these findings.",1
When Guilt Begets Pleasure: The Positive Effect of a Negative Emotion,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Understanding how emotions can affect pleasure has important implications both for people and for firms? communication strategies. Prior research has shown that experienced pleasure often assimilates to the valence of one's active emotions, such that negative emotions decrease pleasure. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure, such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that generalizes to other negative emotions. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for marketing and consumption behavior.",1
The Illusion of Wealth and Its Reversal,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Research on choice architecture is shaping policy around the world, touching on areas ranging from retirement economics to environmental issues. Recently, researchers and policy makers have begun paying more attention not just to choice architecture but also to information architecture, or the format in which information is presented to people. In this article, the authors investigate information architecture as it applies to consumption in retirement. Specifically, in three experiments, they examine how people react to lump sums versus equivalent streams of monthly income. Their primary question of interest is whether people exhibit more or less sensitivity to changes in retirement wealth expressed as lump sums (e.g., $100,000) or monthly equivalents (e.g., $500 per month for life). They also test whether people exhibit an ?illusion of wealth,? by which lump sums seem more adequate than monthly amounts in certain conditions, as well as the opposite effect, in which lump sums seem less adequate. They conclude by discussing how format-dependent perceptions of wealth can affect policy and consumers? financial decision making.",1
The Economic and Cognitive Costs of Annoying Display Advertisements,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Some online display advertisements are annoying. Although publishers know the payment they receive to run annoying ads, little is known about the cost that such ads incur (e.g., causing website abandonment). Across three empirical studies, the authors address two primary questions: (1) What is the economic cost of annoying ads to publishers? and (2) What is the cognitive impact of annoying ads to users? First, the authors conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect reading processes. They conclude that in plausible scenarios, the practice of running annoying ads can cost more money than it earns.",1
Empirical Analysis of Budget and Allocation of Trade Promotions in the U.S. Supermarket Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Using a unique data set, the authors examine the role of manufacturer and retailer characteristics in the joint determination of trade promotion budgets for supermarket brands and their allocation across trade promotion types. They find that manufacturer variables, such as brand position in retailer product category and brand price premium, and annual retailer sales determine trade promotion budgets. Furthermore, retail companies with larger shares of private labels in product category sales, larger annual sales, and stronger brand positioning are able to increase the allocation of promotional funds to off-invoices and decrease allocation to performance-based trade promotions, such as scanbacks/ accruals and billbacks. Manufacturers with formal trade promotion policies tend to decrease allocation to off-invoices. The authors discuss marketing policy implications of this study and provide research directions.",1
Tweeting as a Marketing Tool: A Field Experiment in the TV Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Many businesses today have adopted tweeting as a new form of product marketing. However, whether and how tweeting affects product demand remains inconclusive. The authors explore this question using a randomized field experiment on Sina Weibo, the top tweeting website in China. The authors collaborate with a major global media company and examine how the viewing of its TV shows is affected by (1) the media company's tweets about its shows, and (2) recruited Weibo influentials? retweets of the company tweets. The authors find that both company tweets and influential retweets increase show viewing, but in different ways. Company tweets directly boost viewing, whereas influential retweets increase viewing if the show tweet is informative. Meanwhile, influential retweets are more effective than company tweets in bringing new Weibo followers to the company, which indirectly increases viewing. The authors discuss recommendations on how to manage tweeting as a marketing tool.",1
Promotion of Prescription Drugs and Its Impact on Physicians' Choice Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2001,"The authors investigate whether and how pricing and promotional activities influence prescription choice behavior using a comprehensive panel of physicians and data on competitive price and promotional activities. The authors find that physicians are characterized by fairly limited price sensitivity, detailing and samples have a mostly informative effect on physicians, and physicians with a relatively large number of Medicare or health maintenance organization patients are less influenced by promotion than other physicians are.",0
Synergistic Effects of Relationship Managers? Social Networks on Sales Performance,Journal of Marketing,2014,"This article integrates relationship marketing and social network perspectives to develop and test a model that links objective sales performance with the informational and cooperative benefits that stem from relationship managers? (RMs') social capital structure (brokerage and density) and relations (formal and informal networks). The authors demonstrate the effect of cross-network and overlap-network synergies on performance. Data about both formal and informal networks of 464 employees, including 101 RMs, demonstrate that RMs? performance improves with cross-network synergy when informational benefits from wide-reaching, nonoverlapping ties in the informal network combine with the cooperative benefits of a densely interconnected formal network. In addition, the effects of formal and informal social capital structure on performance increase significantly when RMs have a high degree of network overlap between their formal and informal networks.",0
The Effect of Experiential Analogies on Consumer Perceptions and Attitudes,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Consumers desire products that provide meaningful experiences. Therefore, a marketer's success often depends on familiarizing consumers with the unique experience a product offers. Marketers recognize the value in communicating about a product experience through analogy, but little research has investigated if and why these analogies are persuasive. By comparing a product to a familiar but disparate experience, an analogy has the power to focus consumers on the evaluative, emotional, and multisensory information associated with the product experience. This focus on subjective product experience enables the identification of base preference (i.e., a consumer's liking for the comparison experience) as an important moderator of analogical persuasiveness. In addition, the emotional knowledge transfer perspective applied in this research contributes to a better understanding of the role of emotional knowledge and experienced emotion in analogical thinking.",1
Having versus Consuming: Failure to Estimate Usage Frequency Makes Consumers Prefer Multifeature Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The authors investigate whether consumers systematically consider feature usage before making multifunctional product purchase decisions. Across five studies and four product domains, the article shows that consumers fail to estimate their feature usage rate before purchasing multifunctional products, negatively affecting product satisfaction. The findings demonstrate that when consumers do estimate their feature usage before choice, preferences shift from many-feature products toward few-feature products. The authors show that this shift in preferences is due to a change in elaboration from having features to using features, and they identify three key moderators to the effect: need for cognition, feature trivialness, and materialism. Finally, the authors investigate the downstream consequences of usage estimation on product satisfaction, demonstrating that consumers who estimate usage before choice experience greater product satisfaction and are more likely to recommend their chosen product. These results point to the relative importance consumers place on having versus using product features.",1
Is Retail Category Management Worth the Effort (and Does a Category Captain Help or Hinder)?,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Category management (CM) is challenging for retailers that sell thousands of products across hundreds of categories and often lack the resources and capabilities to manage all of them intensively. Some retailers respond by picking one supplier to be a ?category captain? that manages the category?including rivals? brands?on their behalf. Others worry that influential captains will be opportunistic and that the benefits of intensive CM are simply not worth the costs. However, there is little conceptual development or empirical evidence concerning CM best practices. The authors develop a comprehensive model of retail CM based on a synthesis of field interviews and relevant literature, especially work on governance value analysis theory. Their test of the model using category and financial growth data from U.S. supermarket chains shows that more intensive CM improves results. Furthermore, use of a category captain increases CM effort and results, without increasing opportunism or problems with other suppliers. The authors also find that retailers with more resources are less likely to rely on help from a category captain; yet the level of retailer resources is not related to CM intensity. Thus, ?go-it-alone? retailers do not deploy their own resources on CM and miss out on the corresponding performance improvements.",0
"Executive Insights: International Marketing Managers: A Comparison of Japanese, German, and U.S. Perceptions",Journal of International Marketing,1999,"A competent international marketing manager is critical to any firm's international success. In this study, U.S., Japanese, and German executives were asked whether firms should depend on existing domestic personnel to grow their business and what skill sets are important to the success of domestically based international marketing managers and firms. Japanese and German executives preferred local (host-country) talent, whereas U.S. executives believed that domestic marketing resources were at least as significant. Japanese, German, and U.S. selection of the skills required of a domestically based international marketing manager were consistent. Findings can be applied to hiring and training of international marketing managers.",0
Does Price Elasticity Vary with Economic Growth? A Cross-Category Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"How does price sensitivity change with the macroeconomic environment? The authors explore this question by measuring price elasticity using household-level data across 19 grocery categories over 24 quarters. For each category, they estimate a separate random coefficients logit model with quarter-specific price response parameters and control functions to address endogeneity. This specification yields a novel set of 456 elasticities across categories and time that are generated using the same method and therefore can be directly compared. On average, price sensitivity is countercyclical: It rises when the macroeconomy weakens. However, substantial variation exists, and a handful of categories exhibit procyclical price sensitivity. The authors show that the relationship between price sensitivity and macroeconomic growth correlates strongly with the average level of price sensitivity in a category. They examine several explanations for this result and conclude that a category's share of wallet is the more likely driver versus alternative explanations based on product perishability, substitution across consumption channels, or market power.",1
Inefficiencies in Digital Advertising Markets,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Digital advertising markets are growing and attracting increased scrutiny. This article explores four market inefficiencies that remain poorly understood: ad effect measurement, frictions between and within advertising channel members, ad blocking, and ad fraud. Although these topics are not unique to digital advertising, each manifests in unique ways in markets for digital ads. The authors identify relevant findings in the academic literature, recent developments in practice, and promising topics for future research.",0
Waiting for the Web: How Screen Color Affects Time Perception,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors investigate the link between the color of a Web page's background screen while the page is downloading and the perceived quickness of the download. They draw on research that supports links between color and feelings of relaxation and between feelings of relaxation and time perception. The authors predict that the background screen color influences how quickly a page is perceived to download and that feelings of relaxation mediate this influence. In a series of experiments, they manipulate the hue, value, and chroma dimensions of the color to induce more or less relaxed feeling states. The findings suggest that for each dimension, colors that induce more relaxed feeling states lead to greater perceived quickness. The authors provide triangulating evidence with an alternative manipulation: the number of times subjects wait for a download. As does color, this also leads to variation in levels of relaxation and perceived quickness. A final experiment reveals that color not only affects perceived download quickness but also has consequences for users' evaluations of the Web site and their likelihood of recommending it to others.",1
When should the Ask be a Nudge? The Effect of Default Amounts on Charitable Donations,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"How does setting a donation option as the default in a charitable appeal affect people's decisions? In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large-scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of ?choice-option? defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a ?scale-back? effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a ?lower-bar? effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a ?default-distraction? effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a ?self-canceling? intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for research on fundraising specifically, for choice architecture and behavioral interventions more generally, and for the use of ?nudges? in policy decisions.",1
"Me, Myself, and My Choices: The Influence of Private Self-Awareness on Choice",Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article examines the impact of private self-awareness on consumer decision making. In four studies, the authors show that the ease of preference formation accompanying private self-awareness makes people more willing and able to rely on their personal preference weights. As the authors predict, privately self-aware consumers are less inclined to opt for a varied choice set (Study 1) and are less likely to select compromise options (Studies 2 and 3), unless they find that it is too difficult to construct their personal preferences (Study 4).",1
"Weather, Affect, and Preference for Hedonic Products: The Moderating Role of Gender",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"How and why does the association between weather and hedonic consumption differ between men and women? This article theorizes that women have a stronger affective response to weather conditions, which subsequently induces a larger increase in their hedonic consumption as compared to men. Seven studies show that the relationship between weather conditions and hedonic consumption (food and nonfood items) is differentially mediated by affect for women and men. The studies achieve triangulation by using diverse methodologies (census data, surveys, and experiments), participants (students and nonstudents), measures of independent variables (weather conditions as measured and manipulated), dependent measures (consumption preference and choice), and consumption modalities (food and nonfood).",1
Hedging Your Bets and Assessing the Outcome,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake?for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a ?prevention orientation,? or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a ?promotion orientation.? When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3). These effects drive behavioral intentions.",1
Motivational Influences on ?Buy Domestic? Purchasing: Marketing Management Implications from a Study of Two Nations,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"?Buy domestic? promotions in various countries often urge citizens to help domestic workers whose jobs are threatened by imports. To explain why purchasers might engage in buy domestic purchase activities, the authors develop and test a model that features six explanatory constructs drawn from previous behavioral research about why people help distressed victims. The authors use multiple-group structural equation analysis of survey data from Portugal and the United States to test the model. The results strongly support the model and are quite consistent for both nations. In both nations, supportive purchase-related behavior increases as purchasers feel competent to help; believe that the threat from imports is salient; perceive social influences that support helping; hold values that derogate foreigners but support domestic citizens; and, for the United States only, perceive lower personal costs of helping. These findings suggest implications for buy domestic promotions.",0
Friendship versus Business in Marketing Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Although combining friendship and business in the same relationship can be beneficial, it can also create conflict. A source of this conflict is incompatible relational expectations. True friends are expected to be unmotivated by benefits that can be used beyond the relationship (e.g., money, status), whereas business partners are, by definition, at least partly motivated by these more ?instrumental? concerns. Using a role theory framework and data collected from a survey of 685 direct-selling agents, this article reports evidence that a conflict between friendship and instrumentality can undermine some of the business outcomes that friendship might otherwise foster. It also suggests that this conflict is more severe for friendships that become business relationships than for business relationships that become friendships. Study conclusions do not suggest that friendship is entirely ?bad? for business and, instead, propose that friendship's influence can be both positive and negative.",0
Is Firm Trust Essential in a Trusted Environment? how Trust in the Business Context Influences Customers,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Customers are influenced not only by how much they trust a company and its representatives but also by how much they trust the broader context in which the market exchange is taking place. In this article, the authors test two rival sociological perspectives regarding the influence of customer trust in the broader context. One perspective proposes that trust in the context replaces trust in individual firms and their representatives. This view suggests that firm/representative trust is not always critical, especially for customers with high trust in the context. An alternative perspective is that trust in the context fosters and legitimates trust in firms and their representatives. This view implies that firm/representative trust is a necessary mediator of the influence of trust in the context. The authors test predictions based on both perspectives, using empirical results from two studies implemented in two countries. The results from both studies support the proposition that trust in firms and their representatives is a necessary mediator of trust in the broader context.",1
Theory and Practice Go Hand in Hand: A Tribute to Richard Johnson's Contributions to Marketing Research Methodology,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,This article is a response to Richard Johnson's (2005) memoir. It notes some of the important contributions that Johnson has made to marketing research and reflects on his unique personal and professional characteristics.,1
"The Journal of Marketing Research: Its Initiation, Growth, and Knowledge Dissemination",Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The Journal of Marketing Research has now reached almost four decades of growth since its initiation in 1964. It continues to be a rich source of innovative ideas in research methodology and knowledge diffusion for both practitioners and academics. This article pays tribute to the many scholars who have contributed to the Journal of Marketing Research's success and continued service to marketing researchers worldwide. The authors describe the early years of the Journal of Marketing Research and illustrate how it has become the premier journal in marketing research methodology. In so doing, they discuss its important role in the dissemination of knowledge through the Advanced Research Techniques Forum and other special interest marketing groups. The authors also stress the significant role of software development in the implementation of the increasingly complex computations associated with advanced marketing research methods.",1
Educator Insights: Strategic Partnerships for Global Education?Linkages with Overseas Institutions,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"The globalization of business education involves much more than the inclusion of more international business courses in the curriculum and the infusion of more international materials into all business courses. Like their corporate counterparts, business schools themselves need to become global institutions with operations in various parts of the world to enable faculty, students, and executive clients to gain international expertise and to provide regular and diverse global inputs into the educational process. Since most schools lack the resources to achieve a global reach by themselves, the best course generally involves the establishment of strategic alliances with foreign business schools. This article examines the nature of these alliances and suggests the many joint activities in which alliance partners can engage.",0
Executive Insights: Countering Brand Counterfeiters,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Brands represent the most valuable asset that many firms possess, and the associated brand equity is usually the result of years of development efforts. Yet many brands are becoming increasingly threatened by the worldwide phenomenon of brand counterfeiting, whereby imitations of the brand are sold to unwary consumers as the original. Counterfeits are known to flourish especially in developing countries that have weak legal infrastructures and corruptible public officials. What can a company do in the face of this threat? The authors summarize the literature that addresses this issue and provide an in-depth description of how one company addressed the threat of counterfeits in a lucrative developing market. The case illustrates the lengths companies may need to go to respond to counterfeits and raises many issues in relation to these actions.",0
When Customer Love Turns into Lasting Hate: The Effects of Relationship Strength and Time on Customer Revenge and Avoidance,Journal of Marketing,2009,"This article explores the effects of time and relationship strength on the evolution of customer revenge and avoidance in online public complaining contexts. First, the authors examine whether online complainers hold a grudge?in terms of revenge and avoidance desires?over time. They find that time affects the two desires differently: Although revenge decreases over time, avoidance increases over time, indicating that customers indeed hold a grudge. Second, the authors examine the moderation effect of a strong relationship on how customers hold this grudge. They find that firms' best customers have the longest unfavorable reactions (i.e., a longitudinal love-becomes-hate effect). Specifically, over time, the revenge of strong-relationship customers decreases more slowly and their avoidance increases more rapidly than that of weak-relationship customers. Third, the authors explore a solution to attenuate this damaging effect?namely, the firm offering an apology and compensation after the online complaint. Overall, they find that strong-relationship customers are more amenable to any level of recovery attempt. The authors test the first two issues with a longitudinal survey and the third issue with a follow-up experiment.",0
The Effects of E-Commerce Drivers on Export Marketing Strategy,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"The emergence of e-commerce technology has had a significant effect on firms? export marketing. However, limited knowledge exists as to how e-commerce drivers affect a firm's export marketing strategy. This study develops and tests a theoretical model to delineate how e-commerce drivers affect export marketing strategy. The empirical findings suggest that internal e-commerce drivers (product online transferability and e-commerce assets) directly increase a firm's degree of promotion adaptation, enhance communication and distribution efficiencies, facilitate greater distribution support, and improve price competitiveness for export ventures. Furthermore, both internal and external e-commerce drivers (export market e-commerce infrastructure and demand for e-commerce) moderate the relationships between environmental factors and elements of export marketing strategy. Overall, the findings support incorporating e-commerce constructs into existing theory on export marketing strategy. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial contributions and offer directions for further research.",0
Integration and Responsiveness: Marketing Strategies of Japanese and European Automobile Manufacturers,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Formulating a strategy to compete effectively in international markets is one of the major challenges a firm faces. The authors provide insight into how automobile firms devise strategies that respond to the conflicting pressures for local responsiveness and integration in the context of Western Europe, where Japanese automobile firms compete with European-based manufacturers. The authors develop a conceptual framework to test integration?responsiveness in terms of marketing-mix responses and market conditions, using data that cover four major European markets (73% of Western European sales) and a critical period in European integration. The findings indicate that Japanese firms are successfully pursuing standardization strategies rather than fully combining integration and responsiveness. These firms competitively adapt to limited differences between markets, and this strategy appears to be quite successful compared with the European firms? strategies of combining integration and responsiveness. The European strategy appears to undermine the ability to respond to Japanese firms? targeted competitive moves, despite the presence of significant barriers to Japanese exports. Whereas Japanese firms were able to maintain market share, European firms? market shares decreased over the three-year period examined.",0
In-Store Mobile Phone Use and Customer Shopping Behavior: Evidence from the Field,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This research examines consumers? general in-store mobile phone use and shopping behavior. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that mobile phone use decreases point-of-purchase sales, but the results of the current study indicate instead that it can increase purchases overall. Using eye-tracking technology in both a field study and a field experiment, matched with sales receipts and survey responses, the authors show that mobile phone use (vs. nonuse) and actual mobile phone use patterns both lead to increased purchases, because consumers divert from their conventional shopping loop, spend more time in the store, and spend more time examining products and prices on shelves. Building on attention capacity theories, this study proposes and demonstrates that the underlying mechanism for these effects is distraction. This article also provides some insights into boundary conditions of the mobile phone use effect.",0
The Sales Impact of Using Handheld Scanners: Evidence from the Field,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Anecdotal evidence is mixed regarding whether handheld scanners used in stores increase or decrease consumer sales. This article reports on three field studies, supported by eye-tracking technology and matched sales receipts, as well as two laboratory studies that show that handheld scanner use increases sales, notably through unplanned, healthier, and impulsive purchases. The findings highlight that these effects may be limited by factors such as not having a budget; for those without a budget, use of scanners can decrease sales. Building on embodied cognition and cognitive appraisal theories, the authors predict that scanners, as a bodily extension, influence sales through both cognitive (shelf attention, perceived control) and affective (number of products touched, shopping experience) mechanisms. The results offer implications for retailers considering whether to integrate scanners into their store environments.",1
The Self-Perception Connection: Why Consumers Devalue Unattractive Produce,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This research investigates the mechanism by which the aesthetic premium placed on produce contributes to consumers? rejection of safe, edible, yet aesthetically unattractive, fruits and vegetables, which results in both financial loss to retailers and food waste. Further, the authors identify a novel way in which the devaluation of such produce can be reduced. Five experiments demonstrate that consumers devalue unattractive produce because of altered self-perceptions: merely imagining the consumption of unattractive produce negatively affects how consumers view themselves, lowering their willingness to pay for unattractive produce relative to equivalently safe but more attractive alternatives. This discrepancy in willingness to pay for unattractive versus attractive produce can be reduced by altering the self-diagnostic signal of consumer choices and boosting consumers? self-esteem. An experiment in the field demonstrates the effectiveness of using easily implementable in-store messaging to boost consumers? self-esteem in ways that increase consumers? positive self-perceptions and, subsequently, their willingness to choose unattractive produce. This research, therefore, suggests low-cost yet effective strategies retailers can use to market unattractive produce, potentially raising retailer profits while reducing food waste.",0
In Mobile We Trust: The Effects of Mobile Versus Nonmobile Reviews on Consumer Purchase Intentions,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In the context of user-generated content (UGC), mobile devices have made it easier for consumers to review products and services in a timely manner. In practice, some UGC sites indicate if a review was posted from a mobile device. For example, TripAdvisor uses a ?via mobile? label to denote reviews from mobile devices. However, the extent to which such information affects consumers is unknown. To address this gap, the authors use TripAdvisor data and five experiments to examine how mobile devices influence consumers? perceptions of online reviews and their purchase intentions. They find that knowing a review was posted from a mobile device can lead consumers to have higher purchase intentions. Interestingly, this is due to a process in which consumers assume mobile reviews are more physically effortful to craft and subsequently equate this greater perceived effort with the credibility of the review.",1
When Posting About Products on Social Media Backfires: The Negative Effects of Consumer Identity Signaling on Product Interest,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Consumers frequently express themselves by posting about products on social media. Because consumers can use physical products to signal their identities, posting about products on social media may be a way for consumers to virtually signal identity. The authors propose that there are conditions in which this action can paradoxically reduce a consumer?s subsequent purchase intentions. Five experiments demonstrate that posting products on social media that are framed as being identity-relevant can reduce a consumer?s subsequent purchase intentions for the same and similar products, as this action allows consumers to virtually signal their identity, fulfilling identity-signaling needs. Fortunately for retailers, the authors suggest theoretically and managerially relevant moderators that attenuate this negative effect on intent to purchase. These findings have important implications for how firms can conduct social media marketing to minimize negative purchase outcomes.",1
Journal of Marketing Research: Looking Forward,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Journal of Marketing Research (JMR) has a storied history as one of the preeminent journals in the marketing discipline. This position has enabled JMR to leverage and attract the best manuscripts from authors who seek a broad audience. Suggestions for improvements in five specific areas are discussed: competitive landscape, evolution in the theory and practice of marketing, stakeholder management, managing manuscripts, and improving credibility. Such improvements can be achieved with sustained effort and input from authors, reviewers, associate editors, and coeditors.",1
Governance Mechanisms in Business-to-Business Electronic Markets,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Rather than relying on traditional relational exchanges, recent technological advances have made it feasible for firms to undertake market-based transactions through information technology?mediated electronic markets. The success of such business-to-business electronic markets depends on the governance practices of the market maker?that is, the firm that manages and administers the electronic market. Market makers use three governance mechanisms to manage electronic markets: (1) monitoring the market participants (i.e., buyers and sellers that participate in the market), (2) building a sense of community among market participants to instill mutual respect and trust, and (3) self-participating in the electronic market to build know-how about how the market functions. Building on transaction cost analysis theory, the authors suggest that the influence of these governance mechanisms on electronic market performance (i.e., meeting strategic and financial objectives) depends on behavioral and external uncertainty in the market. Survey data from market makers show that (1) monitoring is effective for reputed market makers and when demand uncertainty is high, (2) community building is beneficial when pricing is static rather than dynamic, and (3) self-participation is useful when the market maker is well reputed and when the market relies on dynamic pricing.",0
Customer Satisfaction Heterogeneity and Shareholder Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"It is widely recognized that business growth and shareholder value are engineered on the basis of investments aimed at acquiring and retaining customers. Along with this premise, however, the literature reveals a growing recognition that the manner in which important customer-based outcomes are constructed in the short term has vital implications for long-term firm performance. Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997?2005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70% in going from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time, increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the volatility in shareholder value.",1
An Investigation into the Antecedents of Organizational Participation in Business-to-Business Electronic Markets,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Business-to-business electronic markets have a profound influence on the manner in which organizational buyers and sellers interact. As a result, it is important to develop an understanding of the behaviors of firms that participate in these markets. The authors develop a typology for the nature of organizational participation to explain the behaviors of user firms in business-to-business electronic markets. The proposed model hypothesizes that the nature of participation depends on organizational motivation and ability. The authors conceptualize motivational factors in terms of efficiency and legitimacy motivations and theorize that ability results from the influence of organizational learning and information technology capabilities. They test the model using organizational-level survey data from jewelry traders that conduct business in an electronic market. The results indicate that both motivation and ability are important in determining the nature of participation; however, the level of influence of motivation and ability varies with the nature of participation.",0
The Role of the Institutional Environment in Marketing Channels,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Set within the political economy framework, marketing channels literature predominantly has used an efficiency-based task environment perspective and largely overlooked a legitimacy-based institutional environment approach in studying channel attitudes, behaviors, processes, and structures. The purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of the institutional environment and develop a comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates the institutional environment into current marketing channels research. The institutional environment perspective relies on the primacy of (1) regulatory institutions (e.g., laws), (2) normative institutions (e.g., professions), and (3) cognitive institutions (e.g., habitual actions) in influencing the legitimacy of channel members. Using institutional theory, the authors augment the current task environment approach by developing three institutional processes and their underlying mechanisms and elaborating on how these institutions might influence channel relationships. The article ends by laying out a research agenda and highlighting managerial implications.",0
The Journal of Marketing Research Today: Spanning the Domains of Marketing Scholarship,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors study the nature of articles published in the Journal of Marketing Research (JMR) during the seven-year period 2013?2019. Consistent with the broad positioning of JMR, they find substantial diversity in domains, topics, methods, and sources of data among the published articles. They observe the emergence of new substantive topics, such as social media, social networks, and prosocial behavior, which reinforce the continued relevance of JMR. Notably, they observe increasing convergence across articles in the behavioral, quantitative, and strategy domains, reflecting more shared substantive topics of interest and common use of methods and sources of data. This trend bodes well for JMR, given its historical position as a diverse journal in the field.",1
Marketing Channels in Foreign Markets: Control Mechanisms and the Moderating Role of Multinational Corporation Headquarters?Subsidiary Relationship,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"To manage marketing channels, subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) must balance mandates from headquarters (HQ) with the local realities of the foreign markets. The performance implications of subsidiary?distributor relationship efforts thus are contingent on the HQ?subsidiary relationship. Drawing on marketing channels, economics, and organization theory literature streams, the authors (1) describe the complex performance properties of output and process control mechanisms that MNC subsidiaries deploy to manage foreign distributors and (2) conceptualize the HQ?subsidiary nexus along three attributes that should moderate the performance effects of control mechanisms: task coordination, or HQ's central coordination of processes across subsidiaries; subsidiary decision involvement, or two-way communications and consensual decision making between HQ and the subsidiary; and relational disharmony, or the extent of the HQ?subsidiary conflict. The authors test the hypotheses using field data from German and Japanese MNCs in the United States and Bayesian models that account for measurement error, endogeneity in the control mechanisms, heterogeneity in country of origin, and nonlinear and interactive terms for the latent constructs. The results demonstrate the importance of the HQ?subsidiary relationship for managing the subsidiary?distributor relationship.",1
The Timing of Repeat Purchases of Consumer Durable Goods: The Role of Functional Bases of Consumer Attitudes,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In an attempt to bring consumer psychology theories into research on the timing of repurchase of consumer durables, the authors suggest that attitude functions (knowledge, value expressive, social adjustive, and utilitarian) can help explain and predict interpurchase intervals. Adopting an interactionist perspective, the authors propose that the effect of the attitude functions is contingent on contextual factors, which they theorize as the nature of the product (along public-private and luxury-necessity dimensions) and the nature of the decision (forced or unforced purchase decision). Hypothesis testing is facilitated by survey data on actual purchase decisions and hazard models that incorporate individual heterogeneity. The results support the suggested role of attitude functions in explaining and predicting interpurchase intervals and suggest means by which managers can position their products to shorten interpurchase intervals.",1
Marketing Channel Management by Multinational Corporations in Foreign Markets,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Multinational corporations (MNCs) are adopting increasingly diverse and complex marketing channels to sell their products worldwide. They strive to manage channels that confront diverse demands from headquarters, foreign subsidiaries, and local partners as well as complex market environments. Because extant research on MNCs? marketing channels is sparse, the authors propose an organizing framework to spur and guide research on MNC channel management. As a meta-theory that integrates economic and social elements of MNC channel management, the political economy perspective is used to propose two testable frameworks pertaining to determinants of (1) MNC marketing channel structures and processes and (2) MNC marketing channel outcomes. Building on these frameworks, the authors advance a research agenda to test substantive relationships, elaborate new constructs, and illustrate new contexts pertaining to MNC marketing channels. A set of propositions illustrates the applicability of these conceptual frameworks.",0
Building Organizational Capabilities for Managing Economic Crisis: The Role of Market Orientation and Strategic Flexibility,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Firms around the world often must manage and survive economic crises. Recent cases in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America bear testimony to this point. As economic weak spots are integrated into the global economy, it is timely to develop an understanding of organizational capabilities that can help firms manage their way through such crises. The authors investigate the role of market orientation and strategic flexibility in helping Thai firms manage the recent Asian crisis. The results demonstrate the contingent nature of the influence of market orientation and strategic flexibility on firm performance after a crisis has occurred. As hypothesized, market orientation has an adverse effect on firm performance after a crisis. This effect is moderated by demand and technological uncertainty and is enhanced by competitive intensity. In contrast, strategic flexibility has a positive influence on firm performance after a crisis, which is enhanced by competitive intensity and moderated by demand and technological uncertainty. It seems that market orientation and strategic flexibility complement each other in their efficacy to help firms manage varying environmental conditions.",0
Crossover Dreams: Consumer Responses to Ethnic-Oriented Products,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The authors develop and evaluate a framework for investigating and understanding ethnic product crossover, that is, when a product intended for one ethnic minority group gains significant penetration among consumers outside the referent ethnic group. In three studies, the authors investigate how a product's characteristics, the promotion and distribution decisions made for the product, and consumers? propensity for diversity influence the product's likelihood of crossing over from the intended ethnic target market to mainstream white consumers. Product characteristics interact with both other marketing decisions and consumers? diversity-seeking tendencies to influence whether consumers will be interested in ethnic products and the social context in which they are willing to consume them. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for further research that include consideration of the product's ethnic embeddedness, the context in which the product will be consumed, and consumers? diversity-seeking tendencies.",0
Social Dimensions of Consumer Distinctiveness: The Influence of Social Status on Group Identity and Advertising Persuasion,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Consumer research using distinctiveness theory implies that targeted advertisements are most effective in contexts in which the targeted group is a numeric minority. The authors investigate the influence of group social status in addition to numeric status in a study of South African consumers. Results demonstrate that when social dimensions are incorporated, targeted advertisements can be effective even in contexts in which the targeted group is a numeric majority. Results also illustrate how consumer distinctiveness may exist at multiple levels of analysis. The authors discuss the implications of the results for understanding the influence of social context on consumer distinctiveness and responses to targeted marketing efforts.",1
The Slippery Slope: The Impact of Feature Alignability on Search and Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research challenges the notion that increased search effort results in greater satisfaction with the choice by examining the impact of alignability on search quantity and search outcomes. Options that vary along comparable dimensions are alignable, whereas options that vary along unique dimensions are nonalignable. The results of three studies demonstrate greater search among nonalignable than among alignable options. Satisfaction initially increases but then declines with further search among nonalignable options. Although choice difficulty influences search and satisfaction, the primary mechanism driving the inverted U-shaped relationship of satisfaction with search among nonalignable options is feature learning. This research demonstrates a paradox: People continue searching more options precisely when their further search is detrimental to their satisfaction, falling down the slippery slope of search.",1
Examining the Intricacies of Promotion Standardization: Factors Influencing Advertising Message and Packaging,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Standardization of promotional elements in an international context is an important issue faced by multinational managers and has been the subject of debate for several decades. However, to date, few empirical studies have examined the intricacies of this issue, and thus there is little guidance for academics or practitioners. This study empirically examines the influence of four factors?market similarity, process standardization, environmental similarity, and mode of entry?on two elements of promotion standardization: advertising message and packaging. The authors test the hypotheses with both quantitative and qualitative data from U.S. multinational corporations conducting business in the emerging market of India. Results indicate that the four antecedent factors have different effects on advertising message and packaging standardization. The authors present several academic and managerial implications.",0
Business and Cultural Aspects of Psychic Distance and Complementarity of Capabilities in Export Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Psychic distance is a key element in the field of international marketing. Unfortunately, the literature exhibits a lack of consistency with respect to its effects. To help increase understanding of the influence of psychic distance, the authors investigate business and cultural psychic distance as separate constructs. They develop a model in which an export manager's business and cultural psychic distance influences the structuring of the export relationship (i.e., whether it has complementarity of capabilities) and explore whether business and cultural psychic distance enhances or dampens the leveraging of complementary capabilities to increase an export manager's satisfaction with export performance. The results, based on a survey of 151 U.S. export managers, indicate that when export managers perceive greater business psychic distance, they select export partners with fewer complementary capabilities. Although more complementarity of capabilities results in greater satisfaction with export performance, this relationship is moderated by psychic distance. Specifically, greater cultural psychic distance enhances the positive influence of partner complementarity of capabilities on satisfaction with export performance, whereas greater business psychic distance dampens the positive influence of partner complementarity of capabilities on satisfaction with export performance.",0
Executive Insights: An Intercultural Communication Model for Use in Global Interorganizational Networks,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Global competitiveness is predicated on creating strong interorganizational networks. Successful development and administration of interorganizational networks is derived from effective intercultural communication efforts focused on developing relationships. The authors integrate the complexities of cultural influences (i.e., national and organizational) into an intercultural communication model that is aimed to enhance the understanding of the development of relationship quality. The model developed can serve as a standardized intercultural communication process for organizations to employ within their global networks. The authors identify and address four determinants of relationship quality: cultural understanding, communication competence, cultural interaction, and communication interaction. The model provides a better understanding of the complexity of intercultural communication for relationship development in global interorganizational networks.",0
The Influence of the Structure of Interdependence on the Response to Inequity in Buyer?Supplier Relationships,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This research investigates the conditions under which inequity in a buyer?supplier relationship influences a supplier's resource sharing with its buyer. More specifically, the authors examine the effects of both positive inequity and negative inequity under varying levels of interdependence magnitude and relative dependence. They further examine the effect of inequity on perceived relationship performance. The study includes a longitudinal survey design, with perceived relationship performance reported by a second informant. The study, conducted within the context of Japanese suppliers reporting on their relationship with U.S. buyers, takes a nuanced view of both inequity and relative dependence by employing spline variables to disentangle potentially different effects of positive and negative inequity and relative dependence of the supplier and buyer, respectively. The results reveal that firms' reactions to positive and negative inequity vary depending on the nature of the interdependence structure and that positive and negative inequity differentially influence perceived relationship performance. The findings are important for both further research and managerial action.",1
Cross?National Collaboration of Marketing Personnel within a Multinational: Leveraging Customer Participation for New Product Advantage,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Multinational success in building new product advantage through customer participation is contingent on a multinational's ability to understand the moderating influence of cross-national collaboration of its marketing personnel. The findings from a survey of global marketing managers indicate that customer participation as an information source positively influences new product advantage, but this effect is dampened when cross-national collaboration within a multinational is high. However, customer participation as a codeveloper positively influences new product advantage only when the level of cross-national collaboration is high. The contrasting moderating effects of cross-national collaboration have important implications for international marketing theory and practice.",0
Getting Marketers to Invest in Firm-Specific Capital,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Firms gain competitive advantage by employing marketing professionals that have developed firm-specific capital. This study argues that marketers? perceptions of the governance structure employed by the firm to protect marketer capital influence marketers? job outcomes of organizational commitment, organizational trust, job satisfaction, and intention to turnover, which in turn influence the accumulation of capital more specific to the firm. The results demonstrate (1) that a protective governance structure in which marketers are able to obtain greater rewards internally than externally on more specific or less easily transferable capital does not enhance positive job outcomes and (2) that it is through the governance structures? influence on job outcomes, not through the governance structure itself, that marketing professionals are motivated to invest in the accumulation of capital specific to the firm. These results provide insights for senior marketing managers charged with developing a governance mechanism to both retain current marketing talent and develop a more effective marketing group.",0
An Investigation of National Culture's Influence on Relationship and Knowledge Resources in Interorganizational Relationships between Japan and the United States,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The increasing globalization of business has heightened the importance of understanding national cultural influences in interorganizational relationships from both a cross-cultural and an intercultural perspective. The authors use Hofstede's (2001) multidimensional national cultural framework to theorize differences in the relationships between key firm resources. Specifically, they explore relationship resources (i.e., the influence of trust on commitment), knowledge resources (i.e., the influence of information sharing on problem resolution), and their linkage (i.e., the influence of commitment on information sharing) both cross-culturally and interculturally from the perspective of Japanese and U.S. firms. The authors use a sample of Japanese and U.S. firms that report on their primary intra-and intercultural business partners to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that national culture influences relationship resources (i.e., the relationship between trust and commitment) and the linkage of relationship resources to knowledge resources (i.e., the relationship between commitment and information sharing). The authors address implications for both academics and practitioners.",0
A Cross-Cultural Investigation of New Product Strategies for Technological and Design Innovations,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Although design and technological innovations are conceptually distinct and require significantly different resource investments by the firm, little is known about how differing strategies employed in relation to these new products influence changes in market share across national cultures. In this study, the authors provide insights into how technological and design product innovations and product portfolio breadth strategies influence changes in market share within 26 technological and 12 design innovations across 17 firms operating in eight European countries. The results indicate that the positive effect of design innovation on changes in market share strengthens as individualism and indulgence increase, whereas the positive relationship between technological innovations and market share is weakened as uncertainty avoidance and indulgence increase. In addition, the positive relationship between design product portfolio breadth strategies and changes in market share is strengthened as individualism and indulgence increase but is weakened as uncertainty avoidance increases, whereas the positive relationship between technological product portfolio breadth and changes in market share is strengthened as individualism increases. The authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.",0
Country-Level Performance of New Experience Products in a Global Rollout: The Moderating Effects of Economic Wealth and National Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"International marketing manager decisions pertaining to a new experience product's global rollout are critical to the product's country-level performance. Extending work on the lead?lag and success-breeds-success effects, the authors examine how the country-specific factors of economic wealth and national culture influence the effects of a new experience product's global rollout decisions (i.e., the time lag from initial lead country introduction to target country introduction and the number of countries in which the product was introduced before its introduction in the target country) on the product's country-level performance. The authors employ hierarchical linear modeling and, from an examination of 259 unique movies gathered from 16 countries, corresponding to 2,523 total entries between 2006 and 2007, find significant interaction effects between a country's economic wealth and national culture and time lag and target country position on the new experience product's country-level performance. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications.",0
Understanding the Importance of the Length of Global Product Rollout: An Examination in the Motion Picture Industry,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Employing the resource-based view of the firm and the competitive forces perspective, the authors examine how brand equity (star power, director power, and brand extensions), financial resources, and competitive intensity serve both as antecedents to the length of global product rollout and as moderators of the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance. The results, based on data from the motion picture industry, demonstrate that brand equity, financial resources, and competitive intensity result in shorter global product rollout and that shorter global product rollout enhances global product performance. They also find that brand equity and financial resources operate as moderators, magnifying the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance.

Knowledge Transfer as a Means for Relationship Development: A Kazakhstan?Foreign International Joint Venture Illustration,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Developing effective international joint ventures (IJVs) is critical for firms entering economies in transition, such as Kazakhstan. The resource-based view of the firm forms the foundation to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners. Traditionally, the transfer of knowledge between IJV partners has been theorized to lessen dependence, increasing IJV instability. However, the relationship development literature indicates that the exchange of assets between partners can strengthen relationship ties, enhancing IJV stability. The authors use a sample of 87 matched dyads from two-party IJVs formed in Kazakhstan to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners on commitment and resulting satisfaction. The results, supportive of relationship development theory, indicate that Kazakhstan?foreign IJVs with higher levels of knowledge transfer resulted in higher levels of firms? commitment to and satisfaction with their relationships, thus supporting a relationship development perspective of knowledge transfer. The authors address implications for academics and practitioners.",0
"Contract Specificity, Contract Violation, and Relationship Performance in International Buyer?Supplier Relationships",Journal of International Marketing,2015,"This work examines contractual governance in international buyer?supplier relationships by investigating the linkages between contract specificity, contract violation, and relationship performance as well as the roles of contract monitoring and a country's institutional factors (i.e., country business risk and country globalization). The findings, based on a survey of international buyer?supplier relationships, provide new insights into a contract specificity ? contract violation ? relationship performance model. For example, the results indicate that contract specificity is not directly related to contract violation but, rather, that country-level factors moderate the effectiveness of contract specificity (i.e., contract specificity is more effective in suppressing an international buyer's contract violation if the buyer is from a country characterized by low business risk or high country globalization). The results also demonstrate that contract monitoring can mitigate the negative association between contract violation and relationship performance.",0
"Does Sparing the Rod Spoil the Child? How Praising, Scolding, and an Assertive Tone Can Encourage Desired Behaviors",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"In search of effective ways to encourage consumers to follow desired behaviors such as healthy eating, recycling, or financial planning, marketers sometimes use praise (e.g., ?You are doing great?) and sometimes use scolding (e.g., ?You are not doing enough?). However, the effectiveness of each approach in triggering behavior is not clear. A possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone. This research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone. The authors then replicate these field findings in a controlled laboratory experiment, which also provides click rates as an actual behavioral outcome.",1
"Demarketing, Minorities, and National Attachment",Journal of Marketing,2009,"This study addresses two important global trends: protection of public goods, specifically the environment, and the emergence of multiethnic societies with influential minority groups. The study tests the effect of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population. It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups invovled the majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However, higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more to complement regulatory and economic tools.",0
"Fear and Loving in Las Vegas: Evolution, Emotion, and Persuasion",Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"How do arousal-inducing contexts, such as frightening or romantic television programs, influence the effectiveness of basic persuasion heuristics? Three theoretical models make different predictions: (1) A general arousal model predicts that arousal should increase the effectiveness of heuristics, (2) an affective valence model predicts that effectiveness should depend on whether the context elicits positive or negative affect, and (3) an evolutionary model predicts that persuasiveness should depend on both the specific emotion elicited and the content of the particular heuristic. Three experiments examine how fear-inducing versus romantic contexts influence the effectiveness of two widely used heuristics?social proof (e.g., ?most popular?) and scarcity (e.g., ?limited edition?). The results support the predictions from an evolutionary model, showing that fear can lead scarcity appeals to be counterpersuasive and that romantic desire can lead social proof appeals to be counterpersuasive. The findings highlight how an evolutionary theoretical approach can lead to novel theoretical and practical marketing insights.",1
Cross-Validation of Customer and Employee Signals and Firm Valuation,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Previous studies have shown that a firm needs to rely on its customers and employees to achieve superior performance. In this study, the authors draw on signaling theory to develop and empirically test a cross-validation argument. They argue that how a firm treats one stakeholder group will be interpreted by investors in conjunction with how the firm treats another stakeholder group. Investors use consistency in stakeholder group treatment as a signal of complementarity in a firm's investments, which can improve the likelihood of competitive advantage. Specifically, the authors propose that a firm's achievements (lapses) directed at customers have a stronger positive (negative) impact on investors? valuation of the firm if they are validated by the firm's achievements (lapses) directed at employees, and vice versa. Applying a multilevel model to a large sample of firms across various industries between 1994 and 2010, the authors find evidence to support these arguments. In addition, they find that cross-validation is more crucial for firms with a narrow than a broad business scope.",1
Gender Dimensions of Brand Personality,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Although masculinity and femininity are personality traits relevant to brands, their measurement and contribution to branding theory and practice have not been examined. This article describes the development and validation of a two-dimensional scale measuring masculine and feminine brand personality that is discriminant with regard to existing brand personality dimensions and scales measuring masculinity and femininity as human personality traits. This scale is applied to show that (1) spokespeople in advertising shape masculine and feminine brand personality perceptions; (2) brand personality-self-concept congruence in terms of masculine and feminine brand personality and consumers? sex role identity positively influences affective, attitudinal, and behavioral brand-related consumer responses; and (3) masculine and feminine brand personality lends itself to the creation of brand fit in a brand extension context, which in turn leads to more positive brand extension evaluations and increased purchase intentions with regard to the extension.",1
"Customer Satisfaction, Cash Flow, and Shareholder Value",Journal of Marketing,2005,"In this article, the authors strengthen the chain of effects that link customer satisfaction to shareholder value by establishing the link between satisfaction and two characteristics of future cash flows that determine the value of the firm to shareholders: growth and stability. Using longitudinal American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT data and hierarchical Bayesian estimation, the authors find that satisfaction creates shareholder value by increasing future cash flow growth and reducing its variability. They test the stability of findings across several firm and industry characteristics, and they assess the robustness of the results using multimeasure and multimethod estimation.",0
"Relationship Marketing Activities, Commitment, and Membership Behaviors in Professional Associations",Journal of Marketing,2000,"The authors conceptualize and empirically examine professional associations? relationship-building efforts (core services performance, rewards for contributions, dissemination of organizational knowledge, member interdependence enhancement activities, and reliance on external membership requirements) that are theorized to enhance their membership's commitment to the relationship as well as the membership's relationship behaviors. Three components of commitment?affective, continuance, and normative?are theorized to mediate differentially the correlation between the associations? relationship-building efforts and their members? relationship behaviors (membership retention, exchange-based participation, and cooperatively based coproduction). Confirmatory factor analysis validates the commitment measures, and structural equations analysis indicates that normative and affective commitment partially mediate the effects of selected relationship-building efforts on coproduction and member participation. Core services performance was the only construct in the model found to affect member retention.",0
When Does Guanxi Matter? Issues of Capitalization and Its Dark Sides,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Guanxi refers to the durable social connections and networks a firm uses to exchange favors for organizational purposes. This study examines how and when guanxi operates as a governance mechanism that influences firm marketing competence and performance in the transitional economy of China. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors propose an integrative framework that unbundles the benefits and risks of guanxi and delineates the organizational processes to internalize guanxi as a corporate core competence. The authors surveyed senior executives in 282 firms in China's consumer products industries. The findings confirm guanxi's direct effects on market performance and its indirect effects mediated through channel capability and responsive capability. The authors also confirm that technological turbulence and competition intensity can be effective structure-loosening forces, thus reducing the governance effects of guanxi. The findings suggest that firms can improve market access and growth through guanxi networks, but managers need to capitalize on them from the personal to the corporate level. In addition, managers should be aware of guanxi's dark sides, which include reciprocal obligations and collective blindness. This study shows that personal networks are popular universally, but in China, they have unique, distinct ways of operation.",0
Managing Distributors? Changing Motivations over the Courseofa Joint Sales Program,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Ensuring joint program participation by distributors is essential to channel management. Although studies confirm that firms can promote distributor participation by attending to their participation motivations, the authors argue that distributors may change their motivations over the course of a joint program, driven by an increase of program-related information and how their peer distributors behave. Drawing insights from the information asymmetry literature, the authors postulate that distributors? ex ante commitment is driven by their motivation to avoid losses, and after they participate, their ex post adaptation reflects rent-seeking motivations. This study also examines how the participation of peer distributors operates as an information signal that moderates the motivation?participation link for the focal distributor. In the context of an actual sales program, this study confirms the postulate of motivation shift and the salience of network-based information in distributors? program participation. The results show that a manufacturer needs to manage its distributors? participation in a discriminant, process-oriented, and system-sensitive manner by addressing the latter's diverse motivations, changing goals in the joint program, and influences from peer distributors.",0
Selling the Premium in Freemium,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The success of a freemium model depends on the number of customers who purchase the premium version in the presence of the free version. The authors investigate the strategy of extending the premium product line to spur demand for the existing premium version. Extending the results of the standard product line model is insufficient in such cases because of the conceptual nuances in a freemium context. The authors conduct a randomized field experiment with an online content provider that offers book titles in a PDF version for free and sells the paperback version for a premium. The authors show that paperback titles accompanied by an additional premium version, either in e-book or hardcover format, have higher sales than those in the control condition. The positive impact on paperback sales is stronger for titles that are more popular or cheaper, and the effect of introducing the e-book version is higher when the e-book price is closer to the paperback price. By analyzing individual customer choices, the authors identify the existence of the compromise effect and the attraction effect in the extended product line setting, a significant contribution not only in the freemium context but also to the product line literature.",0
Quantity-Discount-Dependent Consumer Preferences and Competitive Nonlinear Pricing,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Producers of consumer packaged goods often offer several package sizes of the same product and charge a lower unit price for a larger size. In this article, the authors investigate the ?quantity-discount effect,? or the phenomenon that consumers derive transaction utility from the unit price difference between a small and a large package size of the same product. The authors propose a modeling framework composed of a demand-side model and a supply-side model. The empirical results suggest that quantity-discount-induced gains or losses have a significant impact on consumer buying behavior. The authors also find a substantial amount of structural heterogeneity; that is, some consumers perceive quantity discounts as gains, whereas others perceive quantity discounts as losses. Conversely, the supply-side analysis suggests that manufacturers in the empirical application do not consider quantity-discount effects when setting prices. Through a series of policy experiments, the authors show that by accounting for quantity-discount-dependent consumer preferences, manufacturers can design more effective nonlinear pricing schemes and obtain greater profits.",1
An Empirical Analysis of the Joint Effects of Shoppers? Goals and Attribute Display on Shoppers? Evaluations,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This article develops a decision-making framework that highlights how display of numeric attribute information (e.g., display of calorie information) and shoppers? goals (i.e., having a diet focus vs. a taste focus) jointly influence shoppers? choices and preferences. Across two sets of studies, including a field study involving the launch of a new Coca-Cola product, the authors show that when food items are displayed in an aligned manner (i.e., when food items with lower-value calorie information are displayed below food items with higher calorie values), shoppers assign more importance weight to calorie gap information. In turn, higher importance weight assigned to calorie gap information leads diet-focused shoppers to relatively prefer low-calorie food items but leads taste-focused shoppers to relatively prefer higher-calorie food items. The third set of studies shows that this decision-making framework has widespread applicability and is relevant in any domain in which advertising, retail, and online displays show comparisons of numeric attribute information.",0
Reframing the Discount as a Comparison against the Sale Price: Does it Make the Discount More Attractive?,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Sales induced through price promotions depend heavily on discount depth, so firms create mechanisms to influence perceptions of discount depth. Typically, consumers compute discount depth as the difference between the sale price and the original price, with this difference compared against the original price. But thus far, no research has examined the effect of reframing this difference by comparing the discount depth against the sale price. Multiple studies, including a field study across four grocery stores, show that framing the discount depth by comparing it against the sale price increases consumers? discount depth perceptions and thus increases purchase intentions. As evidence of the underlying process, the authors identify boundary conditions related to both individual differences (numeracy) and managerially relevant factors (discount depth size). In addition to contributing to research on price promotions, behavioral pricing, and numeric processing, the article offers implications for both practitioners and policy makers focused on consumer welfare.",1
The Impact of Informational and Emotional Television Ad Content on Online Search and Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This article documents how informational and emotional appeals in more than 2,000 television ads for 144 car models, aired over four years, influence online search and sales. Increasing the emotional content of ads leads to increases in online search, but increasing the informational content does not. Both informational and emotional content positively influence sales. However, increases in informational content lead to more incremental sales for low-price and low-quality cars than for high-price and high-quality cars. In turn, increases in emotional content generate more incremental sales for high-price cars than for low-price cars. Analyses of the results suggest that managers of high-price and high-quality cars should prioritize emotional rather than informational content in ads. However, managers of low-price and low-quality cars should emphasize emotional content if their objective is to increase online search and informational content if their objective is to increase sales.",1
How and when Alphanumeric Brand Names Affect Consumer Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research develops a taxonomy of alphanumeric brand names (ABs) based on the alignment between the brand names and their links to products and attributes. Five empirical studies reveal that ABs have systematic effects on consumers? product choices, moderated by consumers? need for cognition, the availability of product attribute information, and the taxonomic category of the AB. In an identical choice set, the choice share of a product option whose brand name takes a higher versus lower numeric portion (e.g., X-200 versus X-100) increases, and it is preferred more even when it is objectively inferior to other choice alternatives. Consumers with low need for cognition use ?the higher, the better? heuristic to select options labeled with ABs and choose brands with higher numeric portions. Consumers with high need for cognition process ABs more systematically and make inferences about attribute values based on brand name?attribute correlations. The effects of ABs on consumer preferences are prevalent for most technical products, even when consumers do not know the product category or meanings of attributes.",1
Inequity Aversion and Fair Selling,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This research investigates optimal selling strategies and equilibrium welfare implications in markets with buyer inequity aversion. When buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are uncertain about seller costs, buyers? fairness perceptions and, thus, their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior. Consequently, buyers? fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies. Finally, the basic model is extended to examine how the fair selling equilibrium may be influenced by cost disclosure, buyer dynamic learning, and seller competition.",1
The Effect of Information Disclosure on Industry Payments to Physicians,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"In 2019, U.S. pharmaceutical companies paid $3.6 billion to physicians in the form of gifts to promote their drugs. To curb inappropriate financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50 states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100 million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000 physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among physicians who prescribed more heavily. The authors further explore potential mechanisms that can parsimoniously describe the data pattern.",1
Living in a Global World: Influence of Consumer Global Orientation on Attitudes toward Global Brands from Developed versus Emerging Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Despite increasing attention to consumers in developing markets, few studies explicitly explore the psychological mechanisms underlying their attitudes toward global brands from developed versus developing countries. The author proposes that global orientation, including global consumption orientation and global identity, are key factors accounting for the attitude variance. The results of Studies 1 and 2 in China show that consumers? global orientation positively influences their attitudes toward global brands of developed-country origin. In addition, ethnocentrism negatively influences their attitudes toward these brands, but this effect diminishes for consumers with high global identity. Study 3 strengthens these findings by ruling out the alternative explanation that imports, not global brands, drive such results. Finally, Study 4 indicates that Indian consumers yield a similar pattern to Chinese consumers with regard to the global orientation effect, but the study reveals a relatively weak influence of ethnocentrism.",0
Enhancing Consumer Attitude Toward Culturally Mixed Symbolic Products from Foreign Global Brands in an Emerging-Market Setting: The Role of Cultural Respect,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"The extant literature has not examined the conditions that govern integrative and exclusionary reactions to cultural hybrid products with sufficient detail. Within an emerging-market setting, this study explores how culturally mixed symbolic products (CMSPs) from foreign global brands can avoid antagonistic consumer attitudes. Building on social categorization theory, the authors argue that foreign global brands are viewed as belonging to an out-group and may thus encounter difficulties in tapping local cultural capital, resulting in a negative relationship between brand globalness and consumer attitude toward CMSPs. However, they contend that product category moderates this relationship such that there is a stronger negative effect for nonfood products than for food products. Moreover, the authors theorize that (1) cultural respect by foreign global companies directly enhances consumer attitudes toward CMSPs and (2) cultural respect attenuates the negative brand globalness?CMSP attitude link. These hypotheses are tested using a representative consumer sample from eight provinces/municipalities in China (n = 646). Results provide important implications for global companies on how to benefit from local cultural resources in their localization processes.",0
Signaling through Price and Quality to Consumers with Fairness Concerns,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers with inequity aversion experience some psychological disutility when buying products at unfair prices. Empirical evidence and behavioral research have suggested that consumers may perceive a firm's price as unfair when its profit margin is too high relative to consumers? surplus. The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price. Finally, as the expected cost efficiency in the market decreases, both the expected quality and the social surplus may increase rather than decrease.",1
Within-Seller and Buyer?Seller Network Structures and Key Account Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2018,"In business-to-business (B2B) markets, the success of key account management (KAM) teams depends on how they are structured and how they handle customer relationships. The authors conceptualize relationships among selling team members as a within-seller (intrafirm) network and the relationships between selling team members and buyer representatives as a buyer?seller (interfirm) network. Drawing on both structural (buyer?seller density, within-seller density, and within-seller centralization) and functional (buyer?seller similar function ties and within-seller cross-functional ties) composition attributes of these networks, the authors examine how the interplay between these networks drives seller account profitability. Using data from 207 key account managers across B2B industries, the authors uncover a nuanced pattern of interplay across the two networks. Densities in the two networks are mutually substitutive, but density in the buyer?seller networks and centralization in the within-seller networks serve complementary roles. Cross-function ties in the within-seller network serve a complementary role too, but only in relation to similar function ties in the buyer?seller network. In contrast, within-seller centralization supports both network density and similar function ties in the buyer?seller network and, thus, emerges as a valuable KAM team characteristic. These findings suggest multiple ways for firms to align interfirm and intrafirm KAM networks to improve account profitability.",0
Valuing Customers,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"It is increasingly apparent that the financial value of a firm depends on off-balance-sheet intangible assets. In this article, the authors focus on the most critical aspect of a firm: its customers. Specifically, they demonstrate how valuing customers makes it feasible to value firms, including high-growth firms with negative earnings. The authors define the value of a customer as the expected sum of discounted future earnings. They demonstrate their valuation method by using publicly available data for five firms. They find that a 1% improvement in retention, margin, or acquisition cost improves firm value by 5%, 1%, and .1%, respectively. They also find that a 1% improvement in retention has almost five times greater impact on firm value than a 1% change in discount rate or cost of capital. The results show that the linking of marketing concepts to shareholder value is both possible and insightful.",1
"Spillover Effects of Mission Activities on Revenues in Nonprofit Health Care: The Case of Aravind Eye Hospitals, India",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Nonprofit health care organizations in low- and middle-income countries often pursue a cross-subsidization business model wherein services are offered to poor patients for free through surpluses generated by serving some patients at market prices. This approach allows such organizations to fulfill their mission-oriented and revenue-generation goals. Conventional wisdom holds that mission activities need financial subsidies from revenue-generating activities. The authors examine this dependence in the context of Aravind Eye Hospitals, which delivers eye care services in India. They measure whether the marketing activities (outreach camps) of Aravind that are targeted only to poor patients produce the spillover benefit of attracting paying patients to its hospitals. Using nine years of patient-level historical data, the authors find that camps increase the flow of paying patients. These effects are comparable to the camps acting as advertising for Aravind. Using model estimates, the authors compute the incremental revenue accruing to Aravind from a camp and find that it exceeds the incremental cost of a camp. The findings challenge conventional beliefs about the subsidies required by mission activities.",1
Global Customer Engagement,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Advances in technology and analytics have stimulated competition in the global marketplace and augmented interactions among customers globally. It is therefore imperative for firms to understand the behavioral activities of customers around the world to keep them engaged. To do so, the authors recommend that managers familiarize themselves with countries? cultural and economic factors. The authors use Hofstede's cultural dimensions and country-level economic factors to explain the national differences in customer motives while engaging with the firm. This study explains that national cultural dimensions exert an effect on the relationships in the customer engagement (CE) framework proposed by Pansari and Kumar (2017). The authors discuss and develop research propositions on the impact of the relevant cultural and economic dimensions that affect the various proposed relationships in the original CE framework. Through this modified CE framework, they introduce the concept of global customer engagement to help firms design marketing strategies aligned with a country's culture and economy to obtain improved CE and enhanced firm performance.",0
When Corporate Image Affects Product Evaluations: The Moderating Role of Perceived Risk,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In two experiments, the authors show that corporate image associations with innovation and trustworthiness (but not social responsibility) influence product evaluations more when consumers perceive high (versus low) risk in the product purchase. Their findings extend previous research by identifying perceived risk as a moderator of the effects of corporate image on product evaluations. The authors discuss implications for the conditions governing the ?flow-through? of corporate image to individual product evaluations.",1
Cultural Variations in Country of Origin Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors examine the extent to which cultural orientation influences country of origin effects on product evaluations in two countries (Japan and the United States). Subjects were given attribute information about a mountain bike made in either Japan or the United States. The target product was described as either superior or inferior to competition. Respondents in Japan evaluated the product that originated in the home country (versus foreign country) more favorably regardless of product superiority. In contrast, respondents in the United States evaluated the product that originated in the home country more favorably only when the product was superior to competition. The authors explain these findings on the basis of the cultural psychological principles of individualism and collectivism. Specifically, the authors show that the vertical dimension of individualism and collectivism explains country of origin effects. The authors also discuss implications for global marketing strategies featuring country of origin.",1
Consumers and Brands across the Globe: Research Synthesis and New Directions,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Extensive research has investigated branding practices, processes, and consumers? reactions to brands in a globalized world. In this review, the authors aim to organize and synthesize the growing literature on branding, culture, and globalization from a behavioral perspective by reviewing 129 articles published over 25 years. Specifically, they explicate two perspectives found in the literature: (1) global-local branding and (2) the influence of culture on consumer and brand interactions. The authors identify conceptual gaps in the literature and discuss how new realities in the macro environment (e.g., political issues, digital transformation, environmental concerns) may affect the interaction between culture, brands, and consumers in a globalized world. This review facilitates a more impactful future research agenda in both theory and practice at the interface of branding and globalization from the perspective of behavioral outcomes.",0
"The Effects of Customer Satisfaction, Relationship Commitment Dimensions, and Triggers on Customer Retention",Journal of Marketing,2005,"In a study of telecommunications services, the authors examine the effects of customer satisfaction, affective commitment, and calculative commitment on retention. The study further examines the potential for situational and reactional trigger conditions to moderate the satisfaction?retention relationship. The results support consistent effects of customer satisfaction, calculative commitment, and prior churn on retention. Prior churn also moderates the satisfaction?retention relationship. The results have implications for both customer relationship managers and researchers who use satisfaction surveys to predict behavior.",0
Take Turns or March in Sync? The Impact of the National Brand Promotion Calendar on Manufacturer and Retailer Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Featured price cuts are a popular tool among brand manufacturers and retailers. However, there is increasing concern about the net sales and revenue gains from these promotions, because retailers and manufacturers may simply be subsidizing consumers who shop around. Thus, the (co-)occurrence of a brand's promotions across retailers has been placed high on the promotion-planning agenda. This article examines the mechanisms underlying out-of-phase versus in-phase schedules and empirically demonstrates their sales and revenue implications in four product categories, covering purchases of a national panel of households across eight years. The results reveal that calendar effects primarily materialize in categories in which the chosen retailer is driven by brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the manufacturer and retailers' immediate sales lift. However, with regard to net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions?the dominant approach among chains?is not necessarily the best practice, because retailers observe the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less.",1
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Retailer-Themed Super Saver Events,Journal of Marketing,2019,"In response to pressure to defend their stand sales against discounters, grocery retailers started engaging in retailer-themed super saver events: promotional events (1) specific to the retailer, in which they (2) mass advertise (3) unusually deep, immediate deals (4) across a broad range of categories (5) under a common savings theme and deal format. Given these characteristics, such events are expected to generate higher awareness and interest than typical day-to-day promotions, thereby enhancing visits and purchases during the event but also reducing them before and after. The authors evaluate these effects by analyzing 44 retailer-themed super saver events operated by the largest Dutch grocery retailers over four years. They find a substantial increase in visits and total purchases during the event, especially among nonprimary customers and hard-discount shoppers. The larger part of this lift stems from the use of an overarching event theme. Consumers buy less in anticipation of the event and visit the store more often afterward, but for smaller baskets?typically leading to a null effect in terms of profit. Finally, our results suggest that rather than the deal depth or advertising budget, the number of items and media resonance of the theme are key drivers of event success.",0
Cultural Brands from Emerging Markets: Brand Image across Host and Home Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Cultural brands embody a sum total of a group's cultural identity, including a surrounding myth, a tie to its cultural roots, and associations of its past and aspired future. The authors focus on two cultural brands from Mexico and analyze whether their brand images remain consistent when they cross the border into the United States. Data were collected from random samples drawn from Mexico City and the Latino community (of Mexican descent) in the Dallas?Fort Worth area. Respondents were asked to evaluate two television media brands using a brand personality scale. The results indicate that the association between the brand personality dimensions and the cultural brands from Mexico is stronger among Latinos residing in the Dallas?Fort Worth area than among their counterparts in Mexico City. This study contributes to brand personality literature and presents an important insight into the brand image of cultural brands from emerging markets.",0
Response Latencies in the Analysis of Conjoint Choice Experiments,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Response latencies provide information about consumers' choice behavior in a conjoint choice experiment. The authors use filtered response latencies to scale the covariance matrix of a multinomial probit model and show that this leads to better model fit and holdout predictions, even if the response latencies in the holdout task are not used. The authors provide an empirical application along with a tentative explanation for the findings of the effect of response latencies.",1
Sales Drops from Closing Shops: Assessing the Impact of Store Outlet Closures on Retail Chain Revenue,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Although store closures have become a common feature in grocery retailers? strategic decisions, knowledge about their implications remains minimal. In this article, the authors study how closure of a particular store affects the chain sales of a multioutlet retailer operating multiple formats. The authors show that the chain sales losses from a closure vary widely across outlets (ranging from less than 30% to more than 80% of the closed outlet's revenue) and depend not only on the closed store's format and distance to competitors but also on the profile of its clientele and type of shopping trip. The authors offer a methodology for predicting the magnitude of these losses for specific store closures that outperforms models calibrated on observed ?regular? shopping patterns. This approach offers guidance to retailers in deciding whether a particular store closure is beneficial to the chain or, if the objective is to prune an overly dense network, which of a set of local outlets is the best candidate for closure.",1
Warm Glow or Extra Charge? The Ambivalent Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility Activities on Customers? Perceived Price Fairness,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Prior research has firmly established that consumers draw benefits from a firm's engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially the feeling of a ?warm glow.? These benefits positively affect several desirable outcomes, such as willingness to pay and customer loyalty. The authors propose that consumers do not blindly perceive benefits from a firm's CSR engagement but tend to suspect that a firm's prices include a markup to finance the CSR engagement. Taking customers? benefit perceptions and price markup inferences into account, the authors suggest that CSR engagement has mixed effects on consumers? evaluation of price fairness and, thus, on subsequent outcomes such as customer loyalty. The authors conduct one qualitative study and four quantitative studies leveraging longitudinal field and experimental data from more than 4,000 customers and show that customers indeed infer CSR price markups, entailing mixed effects of firms? CSR engagement on price fairness. The authors find that perception critically depends on customers? CSR attributions, and they explore the underlying psychological mechanisms. They propose communication strategies to optimize the effect of CSR engagement on perceived price fairness.",0
Supplier-Selected Referrals,Journal of Marketing,2014,"In business-to-business markets, suppliers often ask an existing customer to provide a referral for them (i.e., a supplier-selected referral), in which the supplier selects a referrer to influence a specific potential customer favorably. The selection of the referrer is important because the right referrer providing the right message can generate business for the supplier. To study supplier-selected referrals, the authors extend the dyadic source?message?recipient communication framework to propose a framework that incorporates the supplier and the supplier's management of the communication between the referrer and the potential customer. They label this framework the Managed Triadic Communication (MaTriC) framework. The authors conduct three experimental studies in which they apply the MaTriC framework to the domain of supplier-selected referrals and focus on the contingent role of supplier uncertainty. The authors find that the benefits of a supplier-selected referral are contingent on supplier uncertainty. For example, their findings imply that an outsupplier should focus on selecting a referrer that would give an all-positive evaluation (vs. a balanced evaluation), whereas an insupplier should focus on selecting a highly credible referrer, even if that referral does not provide an all-positive evaluation of the supplier.",0
Subjective Knowledge in Consumer Financial Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The authors propose that attempts to increase consumers? objective knowledge (OK) regarding financial instruments can deter willingness to invest when such attempts diminish consumers? subjective knowledge (SK). In four studies, the authors use different SK manipulations and investment products to show that investment decisions are influenced by SK, independent of OK. Specifically, they find that (1) willingness to pursue a risky investment increases when SK is high (vs. low) relative to a prior investment choice (Study 1); (2) willingness to enroll in a retirement saving program is enhanced by asking consumers an easy (vs. difficult) question about finance, thereby increasing SK (Study 2); (3) technically elaborating information about a mutual fund diminishes SK regarding that investment and decreases choice of that fund (Study 3); and (4) consumers invest less money in funds when missing information is made salient, holding the objective investment information constant (Study 4). Furthermore, the effects in Studies 2?4 are mediated by participants? self-rated SK. The authors propose that effective financial education must focus not only on imparting relevant information and enhancing OK but also on promoting higher levels of SK.",1
The Temporary Marketing Organization,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Increasingly, marketing activity is carried out within temporary organizations, whereby teams are assembled to complete a specific task within a predetermined time frame. Such organizations are uniquely suited to promoting various marketing outcomes but are not well understood. From a practical standpoint, their inherent characteristics create organizational challenges that, if not appropriately managed, can compromise performance. Drawing on agency theory and research on embedded ties, the authors conceptualize these challenges in terms of particular selection and enforcement problems. They identify three forms of temporary marketing organizations that vary in their selection and enforcement qualities. Next, the authors develop a conceptual framework that shows the selection and enforcement implications of a temporary organization?s task, timeline, and team composition. They also demonstrate that selection and enforcement mechanisms have portable qualities and can be ?imported? to a given temporary organization, from either a prior temporary organization or a larger permanent one.",0
Facing Foreign Market Turbulence: Three Swedish Multinationals in Iran,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"While foreign market entry and expansion has attracted much international business research, few have studied the contraction of foreign market operations and exit from foreign markets when MNCs face market turbulence and decline. This article uses a process perspective to examine the responses of three Swedish MNCs to the dramatic changes in the Iranian market during the turbulent period 1975 - 1992. It bases a view of foreign market contraction and exit on the theory of the internationalization process of the firm, and asks whether this can help us understand the firm's behavior in the face of a turbulent foreign market environment.",0
Valuing the Real Option of Abandoning Unprofitable Customers when Calculating Customer Lifetime Value,Journal of Marketing,2006,"In recent years, several authors have developed models that focus on the allocation of scarce marketing resources based on customer lifetime value (CLV). These approaches use CLV to develop a rank order of customers and recommend devoting more resources to customers with higher ranks. However, it has been discussed in the literature that a simple net present value analysis may not reflect the value of the flexibility to make such decisions. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of a real-options analysis in certain situations. Building on this stream of research and using the case of the option to abandon unprofitable customers, this article proposes an approach that combines real-options analysis and CLV; this approach explicitly values the seller's flexibility to abandon unprofitable customers. Using a combination of examples, empirical analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, the authors provide evidence that the divergence between CLV that includes and CLV that excludes option value can be substantial and may not be the same for all customers. Therefore, the authors conclude that a distribution of customers based on CLV can change when option value is included. Thus, using CLV as a basis for marketing decisions but not including the value of the option to make such decisions a priori when calculating CLV can lead to an overall biased result.",0
Targeting Revenue Leaders for a New Product,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Historically, when targeting potential adopters of a new product, firms have tended to focus first on people with disproportional effect on others, often labeled ?opinion leaders.? The authors highlight the benefit of targeting customers with high lifetime value (CLV), or ?revenue leaders.? The authors argue that targeting revenue leaders can create high value both by accelerating adoption among these customers and because of the higher-than-average value that revenue leaders generate by affecting other customers with similarly high CLV. The latter phenomenon is driven by network assortativity, whereby people's social networks tend to be composed of others who are similar to themselves. Analyzing an agent-based model of a seeding program for a new product, the authors contrast revenue leader seeding with opinion leader seeding and compare the factors that influence the effectiveness of each. They show that the distribution of CLV in the population and the seed size play a major role in determining which seeding approach is preferable, and they discuss the managerial implications of these findings.",0
Educator Insights: Ben & Jerry's?Japan: Strategic Decision by an Emergent Global Marketer,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Marketing students thrive on identifying an ideal foreign market for a product and devising a plan to launch and promote the product. As elegant as the plans may be, though, resources are constrained, and firms that are just emerging in the global marketplace may have a correspondingly constrained range of options available. The decision of Ben & Jerry's whether to enter the Japanese market?and if so, how?illustrates the strategic thinking behind such a constrained decision, focusing on an increasingly feasible option of partnering with a single retailer for the market entry. The case covers a wide spectrum of strategic issues faced by a branded consumer goods manufacturer in the early stages of venturing beyond its domestic market. Students can assume the role of the chief executive officer in (1) balancing the attraction of a potentially strong market against the mission and resources of the firm, (2) balancing the lack of resources (both financial and managerial) for a company-controlled brand-building strategy against the apparent hazards in granting brand development rights to a licensee, (3) making the best of the increasing consolidation and strength of the retailer sector, and (4) developing trust with a local partner.",0
Pretty Healthy Food: How and When Aesthetics Enhance Perceived Healthiness,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Marketers frequently style food to look pretty (e.g., in advertising). This article investigates how pretty aesthetics (defined by classical aesthetic principles, such as order, symmetry, and balance) influence healthiness judgments. The author proposes that prettier food is perceived as healthier, specifically because classical aesthetic features make it appear more natural. In a pilot, six main studies and four supplemental studies (total N = 4,301) across unhealthy and healthy, processed and unprocessed, and photographed and real foods alike, people judged prettier versions of the same food as healthier (e.g., more nutrients, less fat), despite equal perceived price. Even given financial stakes, people were misled by prettiness. In line with the proposed naturalness process, perceived naturalness mediated the effect; belief in a ?natural = healthy? connection moderated it; expressive aesthetics, which do not evoke naturalness, did not produce the effect (despite being pretty); and reminders of artificial modification, which suppress perceived naturalness, mitigated it. Given that pretty food styling can harm consumers by misleading healthiness judgments for unhealthy foods, managers and policy makers should consider modification disclaimers as a tool to mitigate the ?pretty = healthy? bias.",0
Rejecting Responsibility: Low Physical Involvement in Obtaining Food Promotes Unhealthy Eating,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Five experiments show that less physical involvement in obtaining food leads to less healthy food choices. The authors find that when participants are given the choice of whether to consume snacks that they perceive as relatively unhealthy, they have a greater inclination to consume them when less (vs. more) physical involvement is required to help themselves to the food; this is not the case for snacks that they perceive as relatively healthy. Further, when participants are given the opportunity to choose their portion size, they select larger portions of unhealthy foods when less (vs. more) physical involvement is required to help themselves to the food; again, this is not the case for healthy foods. The authors suggest that this behavior occurs because being less physically involved in serving one's food allows participants to reject responsibility for unhealthy eating and thus to feel better about themselves after indulgent consumption. These findings add to the research on consumers? self-serving attributions and to the growing literature on factors that nudge consumers toward healthier eating decisions.",1
The Impact of Incomplete Typeface Logos on Perceptions of the Firm,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This research investigates the influence of incomplete typeface logos on consumer perceptions of the firm. In these logos, parts of the characters in the company name are intentionally missing or blanked out, giving rise to a form of perceptual ambiguity. Three studies demonstrate that although incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on perceived firm trustworthiness, they have a favorable influence on perceived firm innovativeness. The former influence is tied to the logo's perceived clarity, while the latter influence is tied to its perceived interestingness. Furthermore, incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on overall attitude toward the firm, but only for consumers with a prevention, rather than promotion, focus. These findings suggest that firms should avoid incomplete typeface logos if perceptions of trustworthiness are critical or if consumers are likely to have a prevention focus. However, such logos may be successfully employed with promotion-focused consumers, and they may be used as a tool to position a firm as innovative.",0
Cross-Modal Communication: Sound Frequency Influences Consumer Responses to Color Lightness,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This research demonstrates that the synesthetic cross-modal correspondence between sound frequency and color lightness can guide visual attention: high-frequency (low-frequency) sounds guide visual attention toward light-colored (dark-colored) objects. Three eye-tracking studies indicate that this influence is automatic; it arises without goals or conscious awareness, it seems to take precedence over the influence from a simultaneously occurring semantic correspondence, and it even operates despite explicit instructions to the contrary. Two additional studies highlight the potential role for this influence in marketing contexts. In Study 4, the audio frequency in a soundtrack guides visual attention in a commercial, as evidenced by recall of marketing messages. In Study 5, customers in a supermarket exposed to high-frequency (vs. low-frequency) music are more likely to purchase products from a shelf with light (vs. dark) decor.",1
Art Infusion: The Influence of Visual Art on the Perception and Evaluation of Consumer Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"In this research, the authors investigate the phenomenon of ?art infusion,? in which the presence of visual art has a favorable influence on the evaluation of consumer products through a content-independent spillover of luxury perceptions. In three studies, the authors demonstrate the art infusion phenomenon in both real-world and controlled environments using a variety of stimuli in the contexts of packaging, advertising, and product design.",1
It's Not what you Get but when you Get It: The Effect of Gift Sequence on Deposit Balances and Customer Sentiment in a Commercial Bank,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors examine the impact of gifts on deposit balances and customer satisfaction in a longitudinal field experiment conducted at a commercial bank. They find that gifts increased deposit balances, survey response rates, and customer satisfaction compared with the no-gift control. They manipulated several factors within the gift treatment: gift type, the accompanying message, and the sequence of gift value, which improved ($35 then $100 gift), worsened ($100 then $35 gift), or was a single gift. A highly detrimental effect of decreasing gift value occurred on deposit balances. This ?deterioration aversion? persisted in a long-term follow-up analysis of deposit balances. A vignette experiment replicates deterioration aversion and extends the results, demonstrating increased effectiveness of improving gifts over constant gift sequences and indicating that the mechanism underlying deterioration aversion involves the violation of expectations.",1
The Importance of Starting Right: The Influence of Accurate Intuition on Performance in Salesperson?Customer Interactions,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Salespeople make two types of judgments about customers in face-to-face interactions: those that are more intuitive and those that are more deliberative. The authors evaluate the influence of accurate intuitive and deliberative judgments on the performance of salespeople. To evaluate this influence, the authors employ matched survey, observational, and objective field data obtained before, during, and after salesperson?customer interactions. The results reveal that accurate intuitive judgments improve selling performance by enabling more appropriate initial sales strategies. These judgments not only help increase the effectiveness of salespeople's selling efforts but also reduce the amount of selling time, resulting in improved selling efficiency. However, performance is compromised when inaccurate deliberative judgments follow accurate intuitive judgments. The findings also identify different antecedents to judgment accuracy. Intuitive accuracy is influenced by domain-specific experience, similarity to the customer, and empathy for the customer, whereas listening skills and customer orientation influence deliberative accuracy.",0
Executive Insights: Pan-European Marketing?Myth or Reality,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"Should firms treat Europe as a single market with standardized marketing, or should national European markets be treated differently? Which aspects of marketing lend themselves to a more Europe-wide or ?Pan-European? approach? What is the relevant definition of Europe? Although currently ?Pan-European? marketing is more of a myth than a reality, the trends point toward greater integration, therefore companies need to reassess their European marketing strategies and adapt their marketing operations and programs accordingly, using a coherent framework such as the one proposed in this article.",0
Executive Insights: Global Individualism?Reconciling Global Marketing and Global Manufacturing,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Two apparently contradictory trends emerge from recent developments in marketing thinking?global marketing, and individual, or one-to-one, marketing relationships. Simultaneously, recent manufacturing developments have enabled firms to provide ?mass customization, ? or products tailored to individual customer requirements. This article discusses these two issues, and suggests that they are the same phenomenon, viewed from two distinct disciplines. This raises serious questions about possible responses of Western companies to Japanese competition.",0
The Impact of Product Line Extensions and Consumer Goalson the Formation of Price Image,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"How do vertical product line extensions influence a retailer? sprice image? Conventional wisdom suggests that adding an upscale or downscale item to a product line has a directionally consistent impact on price image, such that upscale extensions increase price image and downscale extensions decrease price image. In contrast, this research argues that vertical extensions can have the opposite effect, such that upscale extensions can decrease rather than increase price image, and vice versa for downscale extensions. The authors further propose that the impact of vertical extensions on price image is a function of consumer goals and, in particular, whether consumers have the intent of browsing or buying. The authors test these predictions in a series of five empirical studies that offer converging evidence in support of the proposed theory.",1
Low Prices are Just the Beginning: Price Image in Retail Management,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Recent managerial evidence and academic research has suggested that consumer decisions are influenced not only by the prices of individual items but also by a retailer's price image, which reflects a consumer's impression of the overall price level of a retailer. Despite the increasing importance of price image in marketing theory and practice, existing research has not provided a clear picture of how price images are formed and how they influence consumer behavior. This article addresses this discrepancy by offering a comprehensive framework delineating the key drivers of price image formation and their consequences for consumer behavior. Contrary to conventional wisdom that assumes price image is mainly a function of a retailer's average price level, this research identifies several price-related and nonprice factors that contribute to price image formation. The authors further identify conditions in which these factors can overcome the impact of the average level of prices, resulting in a low price image despite the retailer's relatively high prices, as well as conditions in which people perceive a retailer to have a high price image despite its relatively low average price level.",0
Traveling with Companions: The Social Customer Journey,Journal of Marketing,2020,"When customers journey from a need to a purchase decision and beyond, they rarely do so alone. This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of ?traveling companions,? who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages. Finally, the authors discuss several actionable marketing implications relevant to organizations? engagement in the social customer journey, including managing influencers, shaping social interactions, and deploying technologies.",0
Return on Service Amenities,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Firms often vie for competitive advantage by providing additional services (amenities)to their customers. Although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. The present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.",1
Who's Driving this Conversation? Systematic Biases in the Content of Online Consumer Discussions,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"When consumers post questions online, who influences the content of the discussion more: the consumer posting the question or those who respond to the post? Analyses of data from real online discussion forums and four experiments show that early responses to a post tend to drive the content of the discussion as much as or more than the content of the initial query. Although advice seekers posting to online discussion forums often explicitly tell respondents which attributes are most important to them, the authors demonstrate that one common online posting goal, affiliation, makes respondents more likely to repeat attributes mentioned by previous respondents, even if those attributes are less important to the advice seeker or support a suboptimal choice given the advice seeker's decision criteria. Firms ?listening in? on social media should account for this systematic bias when making decisions on the basis of the discussion content.",1
When 2 + 2 is Not the Same as 1 + 3: Variations in Price Sensitivity across Components of Partitioned Prices,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Firms often use a pricing strategy in which the total price of a product and/or service is partitioned into two or more mandatory components. Whereas previous research has compared partitioned with nonpartitioned pricing, this article examines how partitioning the total price differently across the components affects consumer preferences. In four studies, the authors show that consumers' reactions to price partitioning are moderated by the perceived consumption benefit of the components. Specifically, consumers are more sensitive to the price of components that provide low consumption benefits than to the price of components that provide relatively high consumption benefits. Consequently, when evaluating different partitions of the same total price, consumers prefer partitions in which the price of the low-benefit component is lower and the price of the high-benefit component is higher.",1
Korean Marketing in China: An Exploratory Analysis of Strategy?Performance Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"The authors attempt to identify the types of marketing strategies that Korean marketers employ in China and investigate the strategies? relationships with market performance. The authors expect Korean marketing strategies in China to differ from those of Western multinational corporations. Data were collected from surveys of managers of 86 Korean firms. The results identify four groups of firms with distinctive marketing strategies, including firms pursuing a localization strategy, those emphasizing product competitiveness, those pursuing a medium price?quality positioning strategy, and those passively selling quality products at high prices. In addition, the analysis suggests that Korean firms emphasizing product competitiveness have superior market performance, whereas firms pursuing localization show poor performance. Conversely, Korean firms pursuing the medium price?quality positioning strategy with an emphasis on value for money exhibit moderately good performance. Finally, the authors also discuss managerial implications pertaining to appropriate marketing strategies and tactics for Korean marketers.",0
Technology Convergence: When Do Consumers Prefer Converged Products to Dedicated Products?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"In today's marketplace, many of the newer-generation convergence products (e.g., camera phones, all-in-one personal digital assistants) offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With the increased availability of options, consumers now face another dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they choose?converged, dedicated, or both? This study investigates the choice patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a series of four studies, the authors find that at low levels of technological performance, consumers overwhelmingly select convergence products over the dedicated options, whereas the choice pattern is reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally, they address the managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.",0
"Entry Barriers: A Dull-, One-, or Two-Edged Sword for Incumbents? Unraveling the Paradox from a Contingency Perspective",Journal of Marketing,2001,"The long-held precept of equating entry barriers with sustainable incumbent advantage increasingly is met with skepticism as incidents of innovative late entrants leapfrogging over market incumbents become more pervasive across industries. Ostensibly, the reassessment of the traditional assumptions underlying entry barrier strategy has become imperative; to this end, the authors present a framework that investigates the contingent effects of incumbents' barrier building on their own performance. Specifically, the authors examine five types of entry barriers (capital requirements, cost advantages, switching costs, distribution access, and proprietary assets) for the nature of their impact in the following presupposed yet unresolved roles: (1) as effectual versus ineffectual entry deterrents and (2) as enablers versus inhibitors of incumbents' innovativeness. In addition, the authors take other variables into account (i.e., competitors' innovativeness and incumbents' market and technological orientation) to identify the contingencies of the framework. Using data from Korean consumer product industries, the authors empirically test and substantiate the variable (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) impact of entry barriers on incumbents' performance.",0
Product-Category Dynamics and Corporate Identity in Brand Extensions: A Comparison of Hong Kong and U.S. Consumers,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Should the focus of a brand-extension strategy be on product-category related factors (e.g., the fit between the extension and the core product) or should consumers? attention be drawn to characteristics of the company providing the extension (e.g., company size)? Examining this issue experimentally in Hong Kong and in the United States with samples of students and working professionals, we find that for U.S. consumers, perceived fit is much more important than company size; for Hong Kong consumers, company size does not matter for high fit extensions, but does matter for low fit extensions. We suggest the value of collectivism may explain the relative higher importance of corporate identity for East Asian consumers. East Asian consumers rely on companies as interdependent, collective societal entities to reduce the risk of a low fit extension, whereas U.S. consumers?as individualists?place higher importance on their own judgment regarding the product fit rather than cues such as company size.",0
Political Identity and Financial Risk Taking: Insights from Social Dominance Orientation,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article investigates how people?s political identity is associated with their financial risk taking. The authors argue that conservatives? financial risk taking increases as their self-efficacy increases because of their greater social dominance orientation, whereas liberals? financial risk taking is invariant to their self-efficacy. This central hypothesis is verified in six studies using different measures of political identity, self-efficacy, and financial risk taking. The studies also use different samples of U.S. consumers, including online panels, a large-scale data set spanning five election cycles, and a secondary data set of political donations made by managers at companies. Finally, the authors articulate and demonstrate the mediating effect of individuals? focus on the upside potential of a decision among conservatives but not liberals.",1
Relative Strategic Emphasis and Firm-Idiosyncratic Risk: The Moderating Role of Relative Performance and Demand Instability,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Firms may allocate scarce resources to two fundamental strategic processes: value creation and value appropriation. The relative investment in these processes (i.e., a firm's relative strategic emphasis) may be associated with firm-idiosyncratic risk. Empirically, a firm's relative strategic emphasis is represented by the difference between its advertising expenditure and its research-and-development expenditure. Using data from 2,403 firms over the period of 2000?2014, the authors find that firms? relative strategic emphasis on value appropriation versus value creation reduces firm risk, though in a contingent manner. This association is weaker when firms have larger positive or negative relative performance. Furthermore, these contingent associations are stronger when demand instability in an industry is higher. Overall, the results demonstrate that a firm's strategic emphasis should be examined in light of its relative performance, as well as in the context of current market conditions, when making judicious resource allocation decisions.",0
Signaling Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research introduces ?brand prominence,? a construct reflecting the conspicuousness of a brand's mark or logo on a product. The authors propose a taxonomy that assigns consumers to one of four groups according to their wealth and need for status, and they demonstrate how each group's preference for conspicuously or inconspicuously branded luxury goods corresponds predictably with their desire to associate or dissociate with members of their own and other groups. Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them. Those who are high in need for status but cannot afford true luxury use loud counterfeits to emulate those they recognize to be wealthy. Field experiments along with analysis of market data (including counterfeits) support the proposed model of status signaling using brand prominence.",0
Creating a Quality Culture through Organizational Change: A Case Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Previous works on the implementation of strategic objectives have neglected to consider the critical role of quality management. Beginning with the assumption that the role of quality is instrumental to the successful implementation of any form of generic strategy, a conceptual model of quality management is developed through a set of case studies with 13 North American and European Fortune 500 companies. The results suggest that firms that have experienced greater global competition in earlier years have implemented Total Quality Management (TQM) initiatives earlier, and their programs are subsequently more advanced. Firms with advanced TQM implementation have made significant infrastructural changes within their organizations, and have also embraced the principles of continuous improvement as a critical component of their corporate culture. Moreover, quality has developed into a cultural artifact with an associated language and history that provides an integrating mechanism linking a firm's value-adding activities.",0
Executive Insights: Coordinating International Advertising?The Goodyear Case Revisited for Latin America,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"In the mid-1970s, Goodyear's European advertising approach?designed to achieve an optimal balance between standardization and localization?was presented in a Journal of Marketing article. Since that approach was discussed, the interest in the standardize/localize issue has continued to receive extensive attention from both practitioners and academicians. This article reviews Goodyear's 1970s approach in light of today's global marketing environment and outlines how it differs from the firm's current patterned approach in Latin America. The steps followed in developing the current patterned approach are detailed, and the authors discuss the reasons for its success.",0
Demonstrating the Value of Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Marketing departments are under increased pressure to demonstrate their economic value to the firm. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that marketing uses attitudinal (e.g., brand awareness), behavioral (e.g., brand loyalty), and financial (e.g., sales revenue) performance metrics, which do not correlate highly with each other. Thus, one metric could view marketing initiatives as successful, whereas another could interpret them as a waste of resources. The resulting ambiguity has several consequences for marketing practice. Among these are that the scope and objectives of marketing differ widely across organizations. There is confusion about the difference between marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Hard and soft metrics and offline and online metrics are typically not integrated. The two dominant tools for marketing impact assessment, response models and experiments, are rarely combined. Risk in marketing planning and execution receives little consideration, and analytic insights are not communicated effectively to drive decisions. The authors first examine how these factors affect both research and practice. They then discuss how the use of marketing analytics can improve marketing decision making at different levels of the organization. The authors identify gaps in marketing's knowledge base that set the stage for further research and enhanced practice in demonstrating marketing's value.",0
"Marketing, Through the Eyes of the Stigmatized",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"A consumer?s personal attribute (e.g., disease, body weight) can assume the qualities of a stigma (i.e., become a source of devaluation by others) in the presence of certain audiences, which can affect consumption and represent a major hurdle to marketers in many industries (e.g., health care). Two field experiments manipulating the marketing communications sent to 1,453 consumers diagnosed with 87 diseases of varying stigma potential, as well as two Amazon Mechanical Turk studies, reveal that consumers with potentially stigmatizing attributes distinctly decode aspects of marketing communications as audience cues, to infer how (un)favorable observers of their consumption will be in light of the potential stigma. When consumers possess potentially stigmatizing attributes, audience cues influence social devaluation inferences, which influence their beneficial consumption (program enrollment, long-term engagement in health care program; e.g., 64% click-through decrease) and their interest in detrimental consumption (products that promise to alleviate the stigma but are associated with considerable risks). Anticipated empowerment may increase beneficial consumption among consumers managing stigmatizing attributes.",1
"Group Marketing: Theory, Mechanisms, and Dynamics",Journal of Marketing,2017,"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors.",0
Transformational Relationship Events,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Exchange events are fundamental building blocks of business relationships and essential to relationship development. However, some events contribute to incremental relationship development, as predicted by life cycle theories, whereas others spark ?turning points? with dramatic impacts on the relationship. Such transformational relationship events are encounters between exchange partners that significantly disconfirm relational expectations (positively or negatively); they result in dramatic, discontinuous change to the relationship's trajectory and often reformulate the relationship itself. With a three-study, multimethod design, the authors (1) establish a foundation for differentiating dramatic and incremental exchange events on the basis of relational versus product expectations and disconfirmations, thus revealing that strong relationships benefit product disconfirmations but harm relational disconfirmations, and (2) conceptualize, define, and differentiate transformational relationship events from other types of disconfirming events and then link them to exchange performance.",0
International Advertising Standardization: What do the Multinationals Actually Standardize?,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"This article reports on a study of the international advertising practices of a sample of major United States and European multinationals in the EC. The objective of the study was to investigate the detailed forms of international advertising standardization actually practiced by the sampled companies and establish how widely spread they were across the standardization spectrum in terms of the extent of standardization practiced. Many permutations were found in terms of which executional elements were standardized, the extent to which these elements were standardized and how these practices varied by market. These findings indicate that standardization is a flexible and adaptive policy that can take many forms and that to use the term ?modified? to describe the practices of all those companies who neither totally adapt, nor totally standardize, is of limited descriptive value. In other words, these companies should not be categorized as a homogenous group. These findings are important because the rationales behind the practices of these companies are likely to vary as much as the practices themselves. The implications of these findings regarding analysis relating to the benefits of advertising standardization are then discussed.",0
Corridors of Influence in the Dissemination of Customer-Oriented Strategy to Customer Contact Service Employees,Journal of Marketing,2000,"It is widely held that a customer-oriented firm is more likely to deliver exceptional service quality and create satisfied customers. However, little research has addressed the question of how the orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm. This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e., formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that there are three ?corridors of influence? between customer-oriented strategy and shared employee values. The dominant corridor, which focuses on dual (management- and employee-initiated) control, emphasizes the importance of work group socialization and organizational commitment in the dissemination of customer-oriented strategy. A secondary corridor focuses on two management-initiated control mechanisms: formalization and behavior-based evaluation. The final corridor, which focuses on the empowerment of customer contact employees, has a more limited impact than originally hypothesized. The authors discuss implications for the implementation of customer-oriented strategy and the management of customer contact employees, along with several directions for further research.",0
Converging on a New Theoretical Foundation for Selling,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This article demonstrates that the sales literature is converging on a systemic and institutional perspective that recognizes that selling and value creation unfold over time and are embedded in broader social systems. This convergence illustrates that selling needs a more robust theoretical foundation. To contribute to this foundation, the authors draw on institutional theory and service-dominant logic to advance a service ecosystems perspective. This perspective leads them to redefine selling in terms of the interaction between actors aimed at creating and maintaining thin crossing points?the locations at which service can be efficiently exchanged for service?through the ongoing alignment of institutional arrangements and the optimization of relationships. This definition underscores how broad sets of human actors engage in selling processes, regardless of the roles that characterize them (e.g., firm, customer, stakeholder). A service ecosystems perspective reveals (1) that selling continues to be an essential activity, (2) how broader sets of actors participate in selling processes, and (3) how this participation may be changing. It leads to novel insights and questions regarding gaining and maintaining business, managing intrafirm and broad external selling actors, and sales performance.",0
The Bright Side of Having an Enemy,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Conventional wisdom suggests that more intense competition will lower firms? profits. The authors show that this may not hold in a channel setting with exclusive retailers. They find that a manufacturer and its retailer can both become worse off if their competing manufacturer and retailer with quality-differentiated products exit the market. Put differently, in a channel setting, more intense competition can be all-win for the manufacturer, the retailer, and the consumers. Interestingly, a high-quality manufacturer can benefit from an increase in its competitor?s perceived quality (e.g., due to favorable product reviews from consumers or third-party rating agencies). In other words, a manufacturer may prefer a strong rather than a weak enemy, and the manufacturer can have an incentive to help its competitor improve product quality or remain in the market. Furthermore, the authors show that a multiproduct monopolist manufacturer with an exclusive retailer may make higher profits by spinning off a product into a competing manufacturer that has its own retail channel, even without accounting for any proceeds from the spinoff.",1
Differentiated Bidders and Bidding Behavior in Procurement Auctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Why do bidders in buyer-determined procurement auctions often bid above the lowest observed bid over the course of the auction? Are such bidding patterns meaningful? In this research, the authors propose that because bidders are differentiated in their value to the buyer and competition in these auctions is anonymous, bidders infer their potential quality advantage or disadvantage through their observation of competitive bids and incorporate this information into their responses and price bids. Using point-by-point bid data from two industrial procurement auctions, the authors show that bidders appear to be making inferences about their own implied quality differentials and adjust their bidding strategies and bidding aggression accordingly. Specifically, they find that high-quality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding against potentially lower-quality competition. In contrast, low-quality bidders appear aggressive regardless of their implied quality in relation to the competition. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for management and auction design.",1
A Study of Bidding Behavior in Voluntary-Pay Philanthropic Auctions,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The authors investigate compliance behavior and revenue implications in winner-pay and voluntary-pay auctions in charity and noncharity settings. In the voluntary-pay format, the seller asks all bidders to pay their own high bid. The authors explore motives and boundary conditions for compliance behavior based on internal and external triggers of social norms. The voluntary-pay format generates higher revenue than the winner-pay format for charity auctions, despite imperfect compliance, but it generates lower revenues in noncharity settings. To characterize bidding strategy, the authors study time to bid, auction choice, and jump bidding and find evidence that bidders in voluntary-pay auctions more commonly use jump bidding and late entry. The findings have important implications for marketing managers, augmenting the growing stream of empirical auction studies and work on corporate social responsibility. Specifically, combining an auction with a charitable cause may result in increased revenues, but managers should ensure that they are accounting for differential compliance rates between auction formats. Even if low-compliance bidders can be identified and screened out, doing so is not advantageous, because noncompliant bidders bid up prices.",0
Dynamic Brand Satiation,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors develop a dynamic factor model of brand satiation to explain longitudinal variation in consumer purchases. Factor loadings are associated with a brand's position along a satiation dimension, and factor scores are associated with a household's sensitivity to satiation effects. The authors introduce dynamics by allowing the factor scores to evolve over time, reflecting variation in household satiation sensitivity. They embed the factor model in a direct utility model that allows for both corner and interior solutions and show that it fits the data better than alternative specifications. Analysis of a panel data set of corn chips purchases indicates that respondent satiation is better explained by a low-dimensional factor structure, while baseline utility and preferences are not. The authors explore implications for product line assortment in the face of quickening satiation.",1
More than a Feeling: Emotional Contagion Effects in Persuasive Communication,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors develop an affect-as-information model to explain how targeted emotions used in persuasion can influence unrelated products and brands that are presented nearby. In Study 1, the presence of an emotion-eliciting image affected consumer spending on unrelated products in a simulated retail environment. In Study 2, emotional processing ability and whether consumers monitored their feelings moderated emotional transfers between unrelated advertisements, providing support for an affect-as-information model. In Studies 3 and 4, the authors use the context of evaluative conditioning to generalize the incidence of emotional contagion in persuasive communication. They manipulate salience of affect and whether brand attitudes were measured or primed to provide additional evidence for and extend affect-as-information theory.",1
Managerial Empathy Facilitates Egocentric Predictions of Consumer Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Common wisdom suggests that managerial empathy (i.e., the mental process of taking a consumer perspective) helps executives separate their personal consumption preferences from those of consumers, thereby preventing egocentric preference predictions. The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers? self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers? private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathic managers? self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement.",1
Engaging Customers in Coproduction Processes: How Value-Enhancing and Intensity-Reducing Communication Strategies Mitigate the Negative Effects of Coproduction Intensity,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Coproduction offerings, in which customers engage in the production of goods and services, are ubiquitous (e.g., ready-to-assemble products, self-service technologies). However, although previous research has predominantly identified beneficial aspects of coproduction in contrast to traditional firm production, the pivotal role of coproduction intensity within coproduction processes has largely been neglected. Furthermore, little is known about strategies that firms can employ to positively influence customers? perceptions of coproduction processes. Drawing on a large field experiment with 803 customers engaging in actual coproduction processes, the current study makes a first attempt to address these research voids. The results show that coproduction intensity negatively affects customers? satisfaction with the coproduction process. Furthermore, the study offers first insights into how firms can mitigate these negative effects by employing corporate communication strategies that either emphasize specific coproduction value propositions (value-enhancing communication strategies) or highlight additional coproduction service supplements (intensity-reducing communication strategies).",0
Footprints in the Sands of Time: A Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Customer Satisfaction and Customer?Company Identification over Time,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Previous research has identified customer satisfaction and customer?company identification as two of the most important concepts in relationship marketing. Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer?company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer?company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer?company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer?company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.",0
"Disjunctions of Conjunctions, Cognitive Simplicity, and Consideration Sets",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors test methods, based on cognitively simple decision rules, that predict which products consumers select for their consideration sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles. The article closes with an illustration of how DOC-based rules can affect managerial decisions.",1
An Assessment of Chronic Regulatory Focus Measures,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Prior consumer research has demonstrated the ability of promotion and prevention regulatory orientations to moderate a variety of consumer and marketing phenomena but also has used several different methods to measure chronic regulatory focus. This article assesses five chronic regulatory focus measures using the criteria of theoretical coverage, internal consistency, homogeneity, stability, and predictive ability. The results reveal a lack of convergence among the measures and variation in their performance along these criteria. The authors provide specific guidance for choosing a particular measure in regulatory focus research and suggest a composite measure.",1
Exploring the Relationship between Varieties of Variety and Weight Loss: When more Variety can Help People Lose Weight,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Prior research has indicated that greater dietary variety in a single eating episode increases caloric intake, contributing to weight gain and obesity. This study presents a novel conceptual framework for investigating dietary variety across the entire diet according to time frame (cumulative vs. daily), aggregation level (overall vs. episode-specific), and categorization level (individual foods vs. food groups). This framework is used to assess how naturally occurring dietary variety relates to weight loss among overweight/obese women enrolled in a 16-week trial to achieve weight loss. Acknowledging this is a first exploratory attempt to test such relationships using correlational analyses, the authors uncover several key findings. First, whereas cumulative overall variety was not associated with weight loss, daily overall variety was positively associated with weight loss. Second, this relationship was strongest for variety during breakfast and afternoon snacks and was particularly driven by consuming greater vegetable variety. Overall, the authors develop a novel conceptual framework for investigating variety, and through application to a unique data set, uncover novel findings countering some existing theories about how dietary variety relates to weight loss success.",1
When Value Trumps Health in a Supersized World,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Marketers often offer consumers the option to ?supersize? a food purchase intended for immediate consumption. Supersized products may be attractive to consumers from the standpoint of the unit pricing because ordering a larger size of the same product results in a per-unit savings and offers consumers the opportunity to meet their value-based financial goals. In this article, the authors show that such pricing strategies not only lead to greater purchase and consumption but do so by affecting important consumer goals in unrelated domains?namely, by decreasing the importance placed on health goals. Although supersized pricing can have a powerful effect on purchase behavior, providing health cues can prevent the decreased focus on health. In addition, supersized pricing can be used to increase size choice of healthy foods. The authors discuss the study's contributions to theory, particularly for understanding decisions regarding the pursuit of multiple goals and, more specifically, those that lie at the intersection of health and finance. In addition, the results suggest both marketing and public policy implications, including those for the obesity epidemic and frequent use of supersized pricing strategies for unhealthy foods.",0
Gender Jeopardy in Financial Risk Taking,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"This article examines the joint effect of issue capability and gender on risk taking. Across three studies, the authors show that the effect of issue capability is moderated by gender, depending on the compatibility between the goal orientation of the decision maker and the nature of the decision task. For decisions that are mainly driven by achievement of gains (e.g., investment decisions), men's risk-taking propensity is more influenced by their levels of issue capability than women's because the nature of the decision task is consistent with men's agentic orientation focused on the self. Conversely, for decisions that are mainly driven by avoidance of losses (e.g., insurance decisions), women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability than men's because the nature of such decisions is consistent with women's communion orientation. The authors analyze the betting data from the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! game show (Study 1). The results show that gender moderates the effect of issue capability on the actual betting behavior in Jeopardy!In Study 2, the authors test the underlying mechanism through mediation analyses of the focus of attention. In Study 3, the authors manipulate the task nature and demonstrate that men's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in investment decisions, whereas women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in insurance decisions.",1
Diffusion of Measurement Invariance Assessment in Cross-National Empirical Marketing Research: Perspectives from the Literature and a Survey of Researchers,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors examine (1) the extent to which cross-national marketing scholars report measurement invariance (MI) assessment results and (2) what cross-national marketing scholars think about MI assessment in general. In Study 1, the authors analyze all cross-national empirical articles (243) published in 15 well-respected and peer-reviewed marketing journals from 2000 to 2005. Although the results indicate a steady growth of published cross-national empirical marketing research and assessment of MI, only 28% of the studies undertook the procedure. In Study 2, the authors analyze responses from 86 cross-national empirical marketing scholars regarding their knowledge about, attitudes toward, and use of MI assessment. The results indicate that the relatively low utilization of MI assessment is due to low MI knowledge and the sophistication of the techniques. The authors conclude with suggested implications for the field of international marketing and a discussion of future research directions.",0
"Innovation Sequences over Iterated Offerings: A Relative Innovation, Comfort, and Stimulation Framework of Consumer Responses",Journal of Marketing,2015,"Innovations commonly involve changes to iterated market offerings (e.g., new games, car models, film sequels). To better understand consumer iteration responses, the authors develop and test a theoretical framework grounded in (1) prior innovations serving as reference states (comparators) for later innovations and (2) consumer desires for both comfort and stimulation. In Study 1's online game, prior innovations and loss aversion (greater loss than gain impact) moderate evaluations of current innovations, whereby an introduction-weaker-stronger innovation sequence (Periods 1?3 of four periods) generates more entertainment than an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence because the former's weak-opening-then-rise does less harm than the latter's strong-opening-then-drop. Study 2 replicates Study 1 and shows that an introduction-weaker-weaker sequence produces enough habituation and diminishing negative returns to outperform an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence at Period 4. Study 3 offers marketplace corroboration with a film industry test in which minor (fewer) innovations perform better (e.g., sales, return on investment) earlier in franchises, whereas major (many) innovations perform better later, thereby reconciling prior research's opposing prescriptions for the use of major versus minor sequel innovations. The framework and results implicate carefully sequenced innovations for managing consumer iteration responses, including the possibility of interspersing weaker/minor innovations among stronger/major innovations.",0
The Asymmetric Effects of Extending Brands to Lower and Higher Quality,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Managers often extend brands to different quality levels (e.g., Charmin's lower-quality Charmin Basic), which may increase sales but risks diluting brand image. This study examines such line extensions by testing middle-quality brands (e.g., Giovanni's pasta sauce [fictitious], Foster's beer [real]) that offer higher-quality (e.g., Giovanni's Magnifico) or lower-quality line extensions (e.g., Foster's Grog). A robust asymmetry emerges in which higher-quality extensions improve brand evaluation far more than lower-quality extensions damage it. The asymmetry prevails across various perceptual and evaluative dimensions, multiple product classes, numerous fictitious and real brands that differ on various dimensions (familiarity, liking, personality, and prestige), and consumer regulatory focus. Group and individual-level tests show that the standard asymmetry is the modal pattern (though not universal) and that it is associated with two primary underlying processes: (1) opponent processes produced by lower-quality extensions whose negative quality-association effects are tempered by positive variety effects (in general, consumers prefer broader product lines) and (2) best-of-brand processing, in which consumers consider higher-quality extensions more relevant to brand evaluation than lower-quality extensions.",0
Trade-Off Aversion as an Explanation for the Attraction Effect: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This research reports on a cognitive neuroscientific examination of whether trade-off aversion explains the attraction effect. The principal study involves the neuroimaging of participants engaging in choice tasks while their cerebral activity is recorded. The authors examine whether the presence of a third (normatively irrelevant) alternative yields relatively less activation in areas of the brain associated with negative emotion than the activation during choice tasks involving two equally (un)attractive options. The results support the claim that trade-off choice sets are associated with relatively greater negative emotion. The authors discuss the implications of the research for marketing theory and methodology, as well as for managerial practice in the corporate and public policy arenas.",1
Could Ralph Nader's Entrance and Exit Have Helped Al Gore? The Impact of Decoy Dynamics on Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"People are frequently faced with making a new choice decision after a preferred option becomes unavailable. Prior research on the attraction effect has demonstrated how the introduction of an option into a choice set increases the share of one of the original options. The authors examine the related but previously unaddressed issue of whether the unexpected exit of an option from a choice set returns the choice shares of the original options to the status quo. In a series of experiments, they observe that when an option turns out to be unselectable following a choice problem in which it was selectable, the choice shares of the remaining options are predictably different from those of a choice problem in which the option was unselectable from the start. They also observe that this attraction effect due to the disappearance of a decoy is likely a consequence of changes in the importance of decision criteria. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the research.",1
Plural Governance in Industrial Purchasing,Journal of Marketing,2003,"This article examines the phenomenon of plural governance, a firm's simultaneous use of market contracting and vertical integration for the same basic transaction. The author studies two particular aspects of plural governance, namely the conditions that motivate firms to deploy plural governance and the manner in which one governance form influences the other when the two coexist in a joint structure. Drawing on agency theory and information economics, the author develops a set of research hypotheses and tests them empirically in the context of industrial purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the plural governance phenomenon can be understood from the perspective of solving information asymmetry problems between buyers and suppliers. The author discusses the implications of a ?make and buy? approach to extant theory of interfirm governance, relationship management, and marketing strategy in business-to-business settings.",0
"Friends, Businesspeople, and Relationship Roles: A Conceptual Framework and a Research Agenda",Journal of Marketing,2006,"This article develops a conceptual framework of roles in marketing relationships. Drawing on emerging theory from economic sociology and March's (1994) notion of decision ?logics,? the authors discuss two prototypical relationship roles, namely (1) a ?friend,? who uses a ?logic of appropriateness? and follows established rules, and (2) a ?businessperson,? whose decisions are guided by utility-maximizing considerations under a ?logic of consequences.? Next, they use extant theories of interfirm governance to suggest that firms? relationship strategies can be used both to create different relationship roles in the first place and to activate them over time. The authors posit that activation can have several different outcomes, including reinforcement of an existing dominant role or actual switching to a new one. Theoretically, the conceptual framework allows for integration of different perspectives on interfirm relationships, some of which have provided seemingly inconsistent accounts of firm behavior. From a managerial perspective, the framework identifies specific matches between particular relationship roles on the one hand and firms? governance strategies on the other hand. In general, the framework suggests that an in-depth understanding of roles is a prerequisite for the deployment of relationship management initiatives toward resellers, customers, and suppliers.",0
"Interfirm Monitoring, Social Contracts, and Relationship Outcomes",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article examines the effects of monitoring on interfirm relationships. Whereas some research suggests that monitoring can serve as a control mechanism that reduces exchange partner opportunism, there is also evidence showing that monitoring can actually promote such behavior. The authors propose that the actual effect of monitoring depends on (1) the form of monitoring used (output versus behavior) and (2) the context in which monitoring takes place. With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer?supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.",1
The Evolution of Brand Preferences and Choice Behaviors of Consumers New to a Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors examine how brand preferences and response to marketing activity evolve for consumers new to a market. They develop a theoretical framework that begins with a consumer's first-ever purchase in a product category and describes subsequent purchases as components of sequential purchasing stages. The theory is based on the notion that choices made by consumers new to a market are driven by two competing forces: consumers' desire to collect information about alternatives and their aversion to trying risky ones. These forces give rise to three stages of purchasing: an information collection stage that focuses initially on low-risk, big brand names; a stage in which information collection continues but is extended to lesser-known brands; and a stage of information consolidation leading to preference for the brands that provide the greatest utility. The authors use a logit-mixture model with time-varying parameters to capture the choice dynamics of different consumer segments. The results show the importance of accounting for product experience and learning when studying the dynamic choice processes of consumers new to a market. Insights from this study can help marketers tailor their marketing activities as consumers gain purchasing experience.",1
Pleasant Surprises: Consumer Response to Unexpected In-Store Coupons,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"This article studies the impact of in-store ?surprise? coupons (e.g., electronic shelf coupons, peel-off coupons) on consumers' total basket of purchases. A conceptual model is developed that (1) predicts that the use of a surprise coupon will increase the size of the shopping basket and the number of unplanned purchases made on the shopping trip and (2) predicts the type of these unplanned purchases. The authors present the results of an in-store experiment and analysis of the Stanford Market Basket Data to test these predictions.",1
EXPRESS: A Bad Job of Doing Good: Does Corporate Transparency on a Country and Company Level Moderate Corporate Social Responsibility Effectiveness?,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Numerous studies argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) helps companies build strong and positive relationships with consumers. However, it is not well understood why certain companies are more effective in their CSR activities than others. Some studies have attributed this difference to the country setting, but results are inconclusive. Building on signaling theory, this study explores corporate transparency as a boundary condition of the effects of CSR activities on the consumer?brand relationship. Three experiments and one large survey across three countries examine how a lack of corporate transparency undermines firms? CSR efforts. Importantly, the authors theorize that the environment of countries differs in terms of transparency, which is then reflected in different levels of corporate transparency. Different country levels of transparency help explain the discrepancies of CSR effectiveness for increasing brand attachment and building consumer behavior. Finally, the authors tie the diminishing effect of CSR in the case of low corporate transparency to an increase in consumer skepticism.",0
Leveraging Brand Equity for Effective Visual Product Design,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"For many consumer goods, the visual appearance is a vital determinant of market success. Although there is an emerging literature on how objective design characteristics drive consumer preferences, this literature has not yet taken into account that product design happens in the context of a brand?s equity. This research addresses the question of how to leverage brand equity when designing the visual appearance of a product. Specifically, it investigates the role of two key strategic visual design decisions: brand typicality (similarity within the brand?s range) and segment typicality (similarity to the competitive set). Drawing on fluency theory, the authors argue that high-equity brands benefit more from brand typicality but less from segment typicality than low-equity brands. Using data from the U.S. car market tracking market shares of 456 car models of 39 major brands operating in seven market segments across 13 years, the study provides empirical evidence for this conjecture and, thereby, implications for strategic product design and visual design theory.",1
Choice Goal Attainment and Decision and Consumption Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Several individual, social-setting, and choice-set factors have been shown to be related to satisfaction. This article argues that these factors operate through a set of choice goals. Using panel data on purchasers of consumer electronics, the authors examine how five goals (justifiability, confidence, anticipated regret, evaluation costs, and final negative affect) drive decision and consumption satisfaction, which in turn determine loyalty, product recommendations, and the amount and valence of word of mouth.",1
Why Some New Products are More Successful than Others,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Product innovation is increasingly valued as a key component of the sustainable success of a business's operations. As a result, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies directed at explicating the drivers of new product success. To help managers and researchers synthesize this growing body of evidence, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the new product performance literature. Of the 24 predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage, market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task proficiencies, and dedicated resources, on average, have the most significant impact on new product performance. The authors also find that the predictor?performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g., the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures of performance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, competition in high-technology versus low-technology markets). They discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for further research.",1
The Color of Support: The Effect of Sponsor?Team Visual Congruence on Sponsorship Performance,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Brand sponsorship connects brands with large, passionate audiences. The sponsorship literature emphasizes the importance of brand sponsor?team congruence; however, prior research has largely focused on the relevance of the brand to the sport or geographic area. This article offers the first real-world empirical investigation of the effects of visual congruence through color matching on sponsorship performance. A wide-scale study of 703 Major League Baseball fans? evaluations of their team?s sponsors, merged with real stadium signage data, offers evidence of the benefits of visual congruence. Two experiments in the contexts of product packaging and online advertising provide converging evidence of the positive effects of created visual congruence on attitudes toward the sponsorship, brand attitudes, and intentions. Brands without an inherent match to a team can enjoy enhanced sponsorship benefits with little additional costs simply by adopting the team?s colors in visual displays. However, the viewer?s motivation (fan status), opportunity (fan exposure), and ability (lack of color blindness) to process visual congruence moderates its effectiveness. By using the proposed framework, managers can maximize the value of their sponsorship rights.",0
Impression Management using Typeface Design,Journal of Marketing,2004,"This article develops empirically based guidelines to help managers select typefaces that affect strategically valued impressions. The authors discuss the potential trade-offs among the impressions created by typeface (e.g., pleasing, engaging, reassuring, prominent). The selection of typeface can be simplified with the use of six underlying design dimensions: elaborate, harmony, natural, flourish, weight, and compressed.",0
Promoting Brands across Categories with a Social Cause: Implementing Effective Embedded Premium Programs,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Embedded premium (EP) promotions promise purchase-contingent donations to a social cause and are typically studied within a single category. However, EP programs spanning multiple product categories and brands are widespread. This research investigates fundamental questions regarding where and to what extent an EP promotion should be used in multicategory contexts. Using experimental choice data from more than 3500 people in two studies, the authors examine multicategory EP programs in two distinct branding environments: spanning a diverse house-of-brands portfolio or covering a multicategory product line that shares a common corporate brand name. For the corporate brand context, the results show that EP effects in one category carry over to adjacent categories that do not have an EP association. Greater multicategory EP prevalence does not enhance brand attractiveness beyond the effect of a single EP exposure. For the house-of-brands context, there is an inverse relationship between brand strength and incremental gain from EP. From a return-on-investment standpoint, EP promotions are more efficient than price promotions because they enhance brand preference and are relatively cheaper to deploy. The results make a strong case for a more discriminating implementation of EP programs across brands and categories.",0
Efficient Design and Analysis for a Selective Choice Process,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Variable selection is a decision heuristic that describes a selective choice process in which choices are made on the basis of only a subset of product attributes while the presence of other (?inactive?) attributes plays no active role in the decision. Within this context, the authors address two integrated topics that have received scant attention: the efficient design of choice experiments and the analysis of data that arises from a selective choice process. The authors propose a new dual-objective compound design criterion that incorporates prior information for the joint purpose of efficiently estimating the effects of the active attributes and detecting the effects of attributes labeled as inactive that may turn out to be active. The approach leverages self-stated auxiliary data as prior information both for individual-level customized design construction and in a heterogeneous variable selection model. The authors demonstrate the efficiency advantages of the approach relative to design benchmarks and highlight practical implications using both simulated data and actual data from a conjoint choice experiment in which individual designs were customized instantaneously using self-stated active-inactive attribute status.",1
Are All Smiles Created Equal? How Emotional Contagion and Emotional Labor Affect Service Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2006,"In this study, the authors examine the effects of two facets of employee emotions on customers? assessments of service encounters. Drawing on emotional contagion and emotional labor theories, they investigate the influence of the extent of service employees? display of positive emotions and the authenticity of their emotional labor display on customers? emotional states and, subsequently, on customers? assessments of the service interaction and their relationship with the service provider. To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 ? 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting. The results show that the authenticity of employees? emotional labor display directly affects customers? emotional states. However, contrary to expectations, the extent of employee smiling does not influence customer emotions, providing no support for the existence of primitive emotional contagion in service interactions. Furthermore, employee emotions exert an influence on customer outcomes that are of interest to marketers.",0
Consumer File Sharing of Motion Pictures,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Illegal consumer file sharing of motion pictures is considered a major threat to the movie industry. Whereas industry advocates and some scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory, the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain information on the consumers' intentions toward and actual behavior in relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities. The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a significant impact on how consumers obtain and watch illegal movie copies.",0
The Last Picture Show? Timing and Order of Movie Distribution Channels,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Movies and other media goods are traditionally distributed across distinct sequential channels (e.g., theaters, home video, video on demand). The optimality of the currently employed timing and order of channel openings has become a matter of contentious debate among both industry experts and marketing scholars. In this article, the authors present a model of revenue generation across four sequential distribution channels, combining choice-based conjoint data with other information. Drawing on stratified random samples for three major markets?namely, the United States, Japan, and Germany?and a total of 1770 consumers, the empirical results suggest that the studios that produce motion pictures can increase their revenues by up to 16.2% through sequential distribution chain timing and order changes when applying a common distribution model for all movies in a country and that revenue-optimizing structures differ strongly among countries. Under the conditions of the study, the authors find that the simultaneous release of movies in theaters and on rental home video generates maximum revenues for movie studios in the United States but has devastating effects on other players, such as theater chains. The authors discuss different scenarios and their implications for movie studios and other industry players, and barriers for the implementation of the revenue-maximizing distribution models are critically reflected.",0
Conceptualizing and Measuring the Monetary Value of Brand Extensions: The Case of Motion Pictures,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Brand extension value is the part of brand value that derives from a brand owner's right to introduce new products related to the brand. The authors draw on a theoretical conceptualization of brand extension success and present an approach to measure the monetary value of brand extension rights in the context of motion pictures (i.e., movie sequel rights) and to calculate the effect of variations of key extension product attributes, such as the continued participation of stars, on this value. Their measure incorporates both the forward spillover effect and the reciprocal spillover effect and accounts for differences between brand extensions and new original products in revenues and risk, thereby offering marketing scholars a novel approach for evaluating the riskiness of investment alternatives. With respect to the forward spillover effect of a parent brand on the extension product, the authors apply regression analysis to data from all 101 initial movie sequels released in North American theaters between 1998 and 2006 and to a matched subsample of original movies and calculate the risk-adjusted monetary brand extension value by comparing success predictions for both sequels and matched original movies. Regarding the reciprocal spillover effect by which the extension product affects the success of the parent brand, the authors use longitudinal data of parent-brand DVD sales to monetize the risk-adjusted impact of the brand extension on the parent. The usefulness of their approach is illustrated by calculating the monetary brand extension value for an actual movie title.",0
Can Automated Group Recommender Systems Help Consumers Make Better Choices?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the ?right? one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers.",0
Face Forward: How Employees? Digital Presence on Service Websites Affects Customer Perceptions of Website and Employee Service Quality,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Confronted with increasing digitalization, service firms are challenged to sustain customer loyalty. A promising means to do so is to leverage the digital presence of service employees on their website. A large-scale field study and several experimental studies show that the digital presence of service employees on the firm website increases current website service quality perceptions and positively shapes memories related to employee service quality perceptions from past service encounters. Both effects indirectly increase customer loyalty and, in turn, financial performance, and are amplified by employee accessibility and a service firm?s customer orientation. The authors examine further boundary conditions for the memory process: only service employees evoke the beneficial spillover effect to employee service quality perceptions, and the spillover effect does not generalize to evaluations of product quality. Remarkably, an employee?s digital presence, although factually unrelated, augments customer perceptions of service employees? competence and commitment and thus strengthens rather than erodes service employees? role in customer?firm relationships. Theoretical and managerial implications deepen the understanding of how to add a human touch to digital channels.",1
"Detecting, Preventing, and Mitigating Online Firestorms in Brand Communities",Journal of Marketing,2019,"Online firestorms pose severe threats to online brand communities. Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high- and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm?s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.",0
Increasing Saving Behavior Through Age-Progressed Renderings of the Future Self,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Many people fail to save what they will need for retirement. Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards but with present and future selves. In line with research that shows that people may fail, because of a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.",1
I use it but will Tell you that I Don't: Consumers? Country-of-Origin Cue usage Denial,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Despite extensive evidence that a brand's country-of-origin (COO) affects consumers? brand evaluations and behavioral intentions, consumers are often reluctant to admit this influence. Challenging the proclaimed irrelevance of the COO concept, the present study assesses the phenomenon of COO cue usage denial, an unconscious defense mechanism that consumers apply to maintain an acceptable self-image. Drawing on self-affirmation theory and based on two experimental studies (combined N = 462), the authors demonstrate that a substantial proportion of consumers are influenced by the COO cue when assessing brands, despite claims to the contrary. Such consumers not only differ from consumers who do not know a brand's COO but also modify their brand assessments and behavioral intentions when exposed to a COO change. This study also develops a consumer typology based on both the stated (self-reported) and actual influence of a brand's COO, thus highlighting the importance of segmenting consumers according to their susceptibility to COO influences. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications and identify directions for further research.",0
Country-Specific Associations Made by Consumers: A Dual-Coding Theory Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Extant country-of-origin research has focused on the deliberate use of country-specific associations (CSAs) as a cognitive cue, captured by consumer responses to direct questioning. However, such responses only capture rational and verbally held aspects of CSAs and do not reveal emotional and nonverbally held aspects. Drawing from dual-coding theory, the authors (1) develop propositions about the existence of two distinct types of CSAs (rational and emotional) and the differences in consumers? communication of these associations, (2) apply a three-stage qualitative design in two complementary studies to test these propositions, (3) link the identified CSAs to brand origin recognition and brand ownership, and (4) generate a consumer typology on how CSAs are communicated. Their results indicate that people tend to communicate rational CSAs verbally and emotional CSAs nonverbally. Whereas both rational and emotional associations positively affect consumers? brand origin recognition accuracy, only emotional associations affect brand ownership. The authors consider theoretical and managerial implications in light of recent criticism on country-of-origin research and offer suggestions for further research.",0
Adoption of New and Really New Products: The Effects of Self-Regulation Systems and Risk Salience,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article explores how consumers' self-regulation affects the likelihood of purchase of new and really new products. A mall-intercept field study shows that consumers with a chronic disposition to be promotion focused own more new high-technology goods and newly launched repeat-purchase items than prevention-focused consumers. There is no difference in ownership of products that have been available for many years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when risks associated with a really new product are not specified to consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for products that are not portrayed as new. Mediation analyses in both laboratory studies show that the effect of regulatory focus on purchase intentions for new products is due to concerns about the performance of the new technology, which are more pronounced among prevention-focused consumers. Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications.",1
Tell Me a Good Story and I May Lend you Money: The Role of Narratives in Peer-to-Peer Lending Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research examines how identity claims constructed in narratives by borrowers influence lender decisions about unsecured personal loans. Specifically, do the number of identity claims and their content influence lending decisions, and can they predict the longer-term performance of funded loans? Using data from the peer-to-peer lending website Prosper.com, the authors find that unverifiable information affects lending decisions above and beyond the influence of objective, verifiable information. As the number of identity claims in narratives increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers, because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan. In addition, identity content plays an important role. Identities focused on being trustworthy or successful are associated with increased loan funding but ironically are less predictive of loan performance than other identities (i.e., moral and economic hardship). Thus, some identity claims aim to mislead lenders, whereas others provide true representations of borrowers.",1
"Dependence, Trust, and Relational Behavior on the Part of Foreign Subsidiary Marketing Operations: Implications for Managing Global Marketing Operations",Journal of Marketing,2001,"The authors explore how a global firm's ability to foster successful relationships between its foreign subsidiaries? and headquarters? marketing operations can enhance the performance of products across markets. The results show that cooperative behaviors are positively associated with product performance in the subsidiaries? markets. National culture in the foreign markets is also found to moderate the effect of trust on relational behaviors. In addition, the subsidiaries? acquiescence becomes increasingly important as the firm attempts to standardize marketing programs.",0
Investing in Buyer?Seller Relationships in Transitional Markets: A Market?Based Assets Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"In this study, the authors explore whether investments in market-based assets outside of a market economy can be an effective tool for influencing buyer behavior. Using data from a sample of Russian physicians, along with both primary and secondary information on foreign pharmaceutical producers operating in Russia, they demonstrate that firms? investments in market-based assets?which are positively associated with prescription behavior?are associated with physician perceptions of relationship quality. They further find that these investments are most effective when marketers and buyers reside in culturally similar markets. The results also indicate that relationship quality becomes less important for buyer behavior in the presence of authoritative mechanisms?a feature of market transition?and under conditions of low product complexity. In addition, the link between relationship quality and prescription behavior is stronger when manufacturers reside in countries that are politically similar to Russia. These findings demonstrate that the concept of ?market?-based assets and their influence on buyer behavior and potentially firm performance may depend on the existence of at least certain characteristics of a market context.",0
Brand Buzz in the Echoverse,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Social media sites have created a reverberating ?echoverse? for brand communication, forming complex feedback loops (?echoes?) between the ?universe? of corporate communications, news media, and user-generated social media. To understand these feedback loops, the authors process longitudinal, unstructured data using computational linguistics techniques and analyze them using econometric methods. By assembling one of the most comprehensive data sets in the brand communications literature with corporate communications, news stories, social media, and business outcomes, the authors document the echoverse (i.e., feedback loops between all of these sources). Furthermore, the echoverse has changed as online word of mouth has become prevalent. Over time, online word of mouth has fallen into a negativity spiral, with negative messages leading to greater volume, and firms are adjusting their communications strategies in response. The nature of brand communications has been transformed by online technology as corporate communications move increasingly from one to many (e.g., advertising) to one to one (e.g., Twitter) while consumer word of mouth moves from one to one (e.g., conversations) to one to many (e.g., social media). The results indicate that companies benefit from using social media (e.g., Twitter) for personalized customer responses, although there is still a role for traditional brand communications (e.g., press releases, advertising). The evolving echoverse requires managers to rethink brand communication strategies, with online communications becoming increasingly central.",0
Examining the Impact of Destructive Acts in Marketing Channel Relationships,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"In virtually all marketing channel relationships, one of the parties eventually will engage in an action that another channel member considers potentially destructive for the relationship. How a particular channel member reacts to such an act has implications for the long-term viability and success of the relationship. On the basis of a large data set collected from both a focal supplier and its independent dealers, the authors classify dealers' responses to a supplier's destructive acts by extending the response typology of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is based on Hirschman's seminal writings on responses to decline in organizations and states. This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier. The results suggest that these more proximal dealer responses affect subsequent dealer performance and overall perceptions of relationship quality after an act. The authors draw several implications for both dealers and suppliers.",1
Product Customization via Starting Solutions,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Customizing a product by choosing each of its attributes individually tends to be onerous for consumers, and the benefits of product customization may thus be offset by an increase in choice complexity. As a remedy for this dilemma, the current research introduces the customization via starting solutions (CvSS) architecture, which substantially reduces the complexity of product customization while preserving all of its advantages. Under CvSS, consumers first select one starting solution from a set of prespecified products, which they then refine to create their final customized product. Evidence from nine studies (three of which were conducted in field settings) across a wide range of product domains (shirts, cars, vacation packages, jewelry, and financial products) shows that the CvSS architecture results in substantial benefits relative to the standard attribute-by-attribute product customization format for both consumers (increased satisfaction with their product choices, reduced choice complexity, and enhanced mental simulation of product use) and firms (purchases of more feature-rich, and thus higher-priced, products).",1
Agency Participants in Multicountry Advertising: A Preliminary Examination of Affiliate Characteristics and Environments,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"While much attention in the international advertising field has been given to message standardization-adaptation, the scope of multicountry campaigns has been a neglected area. In this 15-agency/344-affiliate survey of transnational advertising activities, smaller, regional campaigns were found to be the most popular form of transnational advertising. Agencies executing these types of campaigns had smaller client bases and implemented fewer multi-country campaigns than those covering more extensive major market or global campaigns. Agency affiliates participating in globally comprehensive campaigns were more likely to be wholly owned than those involved in regional or major market advertising efforts. Parent agencies exercised little influence over affiliate participations in multimarket campaigns.",0
"Reducing Uncertainty in the Emerging Market Entry Process: On the Relationship among International Experiential Knowledge, Institutional Distance, and Uncertainty",Journal of International Marketing,2012,"In three institutional environments, this study examines the uncertainty-reducing effects of experiential knowledge of varying specificity in the market entry process. The goal of the study is to answer the research question: What is the uncertainty-reducing effect of experiential knowledge of varying specificity in markets with different institutional distances from a firm's home base? The authors develop a theoretical model using the most recent developments in internationalization process theory. They test the model with a data set collected on-site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises with entry experience into the new Eastern European Union member-states, Russia and China. The analysis shows no support for the claim that internationalization knowledge reduces uncertainty in the market entry process. Rather, the analysis reveals that societal knowledge of the entering firm has an uncertainty-reducing effect in markets that are relatively less distant from its home market. The analysis also shows that international experiential knowledge of high specificity, an important type of marketing knowledge, provides the greatest uncertainty-reducing effect.",0
"Time, Temporality, and Internationalization: The Relationship among Point in Time of, Time to, and Speed of International Expansion",Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Speed of internationalization is a multidimensional concept with performance consequences, but little is known about the interrelatedness between different time-related concepts. The authors address this deficiency by developing three hypotheses, which are confronted with a data set collected on site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises. The analysis reveals that (1) the longer the time to internationalization, the lower the speed of international expansion; (2) the earlier the point in time when internationalization starts, the lower the speed of international expansion; and (3) there is an antagonistic interaction effect revealing that the negative effect on the speed of international expansion caused by a longer time to internationalization is moderated by the point in time when internationalization starts. The study contributes to theory by examining the interrelatedness between temporal concepts in the internationalization literature and by showing how the underlying mechanisms influencing internationalization speed change over time. For managers, insights into the importance of time and temporality for successful international expansion are provided.",0
"Why Consumers Don't see the Benefits of Genetically Modified Foods, and what Marketers can do about It",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Evidence from four studies suggests that the moral opposition toward genetically modified (GM) foods impedes the perception of their benefits, and critically, marketers can circumvent this moral opposition by employing subtle cues to position these products as being ?man-made.? Specifically, if consumers view the GM food as man-made, and if they understand why it was created, moral opposition to the product diminishes, and the GM food's perceived benefits increase, which subsequently increases purchase intentions for the product. This effect is replicated in the field (in both controlled and naturalistic settings), in a laboratory experiment, and with an online consumer panel. The results suggest that marketers can help consumers better consider all information when assessing the merits of GM foods by using packaging and promotion strategies to cue consumers to view the GM food for what it is (i.e., a man-made object created with intent). The findings have implications for the recent GM food labeling debate.",0
Seeding Strategies for Viral Marketing: An Empirical Comparison,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Seeding strategies have strong influences on the success of viral marketing campaigns, but previous studies using computer simulations and analytical models have produced conflicting recommendations about the optimal seeding strategy. This study compares four seeding strategies in two complementary small-scale field experiments, as well as in one real-life viral marketing campaign involving more than 200,000 customers of a mobile phone service provider. The empirical results show that the best seeding strategies can be up to eight times more successful than other seeding strategies. Seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. This finding contradicts a common assumption in other studies. Well-connected people also actively use their greater reach but do not have more influence on their peers than do less well-connected people.",0
Does Knowledge Base Compatibility Help or Hurt Knowledge Sharing between Suppliers in Coopetition? the Role of Customer Participation,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Competing suppliers that collaborate to serve downstream original equipment manufacturer customers often encounter partners with overlapping and compatible knowledge bases. Such knowledge base compatibility provides supplier partners the opportunity to exchange knowledge efficiently, leading to greater knowledge sharing. However, the ease of misappropriation of the shared knowledge can offset this beneficial effect. This research proposes that the effect of knowledge base compatibility on supplier partners' knowledge sharing is moderated by the customer's participation in the collaborative effort and by the customer value such effort creates. The results of two empirical studies show that when levels of both customer participation and customer value are high, knowledge base compatibility between supplier partners leads to greater knowledge sharing. In contrast, when customer participation is high but customer value is low, knowledge base compatibility leads to lower levels of supplier knowledge sharing. This investigation validates the importance of key factors related to supplier partners' opportunity and motivation to share knowledge in coopetitive partnerships.",0
An Empirical Study of Uniform and Differential Pricing in the Movie Theatrical Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Movies vary widely in appeal, star power, cost, and other elements, and therefore, each might be expected to charge a different price. Multiplexes, however, typically charge the same price for all movies, except for such premium formats as 3D, a choice that has puzzled managers and researchers. Because of data limitations, minimal empirical work has directly addressed this issue. In Hong Kong, however, prices vary both within and across multiplexes. Using daily ticket prices and attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but that the improvement is limited. In contrast, the gains are substantial when compared with the full uniform pricing strategy, suggesting that only minimal differentiation (2D/3D) may obtain most of the gains available from fully differentiated prices.",1
Executive Insights: Growing Consumer Power in China: Some Lessons for Managers,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The economic reform in China has led to the emergence of a consumer society. Concomitant with the development of the consumer society comes a growing power of the consumers in the marketplace. This is occurring in the form of consumers? rising awareness of their rights and increasing readiness to take the companies to court to protect their rights. The author describes seven litigation cases pertaining to consumer issues that involve multinational corporations operating in China. The author identifies some general characteristics that cut across the cases, along with suggestions and managerial implications.",0
A Parsimonious Model of Stockkeeping-Unit Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The authors develop a model to describe and predict consumer stock-keeping-unit choice in frequently bought product categories. The model posits that a product category consists of several salient attributes with many attribute levels and represents a stockkeeping unit as an attribute-level combination. The number of parameters of the model does not increase with the number of stockkeeping units and the number of attribute levels. The authors demonstrate the descriptive and predictive power of their model using 133,492 purchase incidences in 16 product categories. Their model fits 7% better in sample and predicts 8% better out of sample in hit probability than two leading models and requires only half the number of parametes.",1
How ?Psychological? Should Economic and Marketing Models Be?,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors discuss the potential of making the recently developed behavioral economics models even more ?psychological? by (1) increasing their context specificity, (2) allowing different people to have different model parameters, and (3) capturing the underlying psychological processes more explicitly. They show that some of these models already make room for understanding context specificity and heterogeneity, and they discuss new ways to enrich the models along those two dimensions. The task of adding process details is more challenging in simple mathematical forms because these models must serve as building blocks for aggregate market models.",1
Modeling the Psychology of Consumer and Firm Behavior with Behavioral Economics,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Marketing is an applied science that tries to explain and influence how firms and consumers behave in markets. Marketing models are usually applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing. Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium, allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and for psychologists who prize realism.",1
The Effects of Positive and Negative Online Customer Reviews: Do Brand Strength and Category Maturity Matter?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Research has shown brand equity to moderate the relationship between online customer reviews (OCRs) and sales in both the emerging Blu-ray and mature DVD player categories. Positive (negative) OCRs increase (decrease) the sales of models of weak brands (i.e., brands without significant positive brand equity). In contrast, OCRs have no significant impact on the sales of the models of strong brands, although these models do receive a significant sales boost from their greater brand equity. Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive OCRs, and increased positive OCRs aid a brand's transition from weak to strong. This creates a positive feedback loop between sales and positive OCRs for models of weak brands that not only helps their sales but also increases overall brand equity, benefiting all models of the brand. In contrast to the view that brands matter less in the presence of OCRs, we find that OCRs matter less in the presence of strong brands. Positive OCRs function differently than marketing communications in that their effect is greater for weak brands.",0
Effects of Internet Display Advertising in the Purchase Funnel: Model-Based Insights from a Randomized Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This study examines the effects of Internet display advertising using cookie-level data from a field experiment at a financial tools provider. The experiment randomized assignment of cookies to treatment (firm ads) and control conditions (charity ads), enabling the authors to handle different sources of selection bias, including targeting algorithms and browsing behavior. They analyze display ad effects for users at different stages of the company's purchase funnel (i.e., nonvisitor, visitor, authenticated user, and converted customer) and find that display advertising positively affects visitation to the firm's website for users in most stages of the purchase funnel, but not for those who previously visited the site without creating an account. Using a binary logit model, the authors calculate marginal effects and elasticities by funnel stage and analyze the potential value of reallocating display ad impressions across users at different stages. Expected visits increase almost 10% when display ad impressions are partially reallocated from nonvisitors and visitors to authenticated users. The authors also show that results from the controlled experiment data differ significantly from those computed using standard correlational approaches.",1
Measuring Preferences for Really New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The goal of this research is to improve preference measurement for really new products. An initial assumption validated in the first study is that consumers have greater uncertainty when estimating the usefulness of really new products than they have with incremental new products. Consumers cope with this uncertainty by using certain inferential techniques that are not well captured by standard preference measurement techniques, such as conjoint. This research examines techniques for incorporating both mental simulation and analogies into an existing preference measurement technique and shows that some methods enhance and other methods hinder predictive accuracy.",1
The Impact of Candidate Appearance and Advertising Strategies on Election Results,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Spending on political advertising has grown dramatically in recent years, and political campaigns have increasingly adopted the language and techniques of marketing. As such political marketing efforts proliferate, the factors that drive electoral success warrant greater attention and investigation. The authors employ a combination of laboratory studies and analysis of actual election results to reveal influences of candidate appearance and spending strategies in campaigns. They analyze how personality trait inferences based on candidate appearance interact with political party brand image, advertising spending, and negative advertising. The results indicate that appearance-based inferences about candidates influence election outcomes, but their impact is driven partially by trait associations at the party brand level. This interaction between appearance and party alters the effects of advertising spending, particularly the effects of negative advertising. The findings have implications for the marketing of political candidates in terms of their party's brand image.",1
Organizing and Implementing Export Pricing: Performance Effects and Moderating Factors,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Relatively little is known about pricing in the export business, particularly how to organize and implement export pricing within firms and how these issues affect export performance. Therefore, this study investigates antecedents of export performance, specifically the organizational aspects of export pricing and price adaptation and the moderating role of export market characteristics, including export market turbulence, enforcement of contracts, and corruption ranks of the export market. Using a large-scale survey sample of 295 exporting firms in Austria and Germany and secondary data on the export markets involved, the authors show that both the intensity of internal pricing coordination and price adaptation have a positive effect on export performance. Specifically, in highly turbulent export markets, the intensity of internal pricing coordination contributes to export performance. Furthermore, a high level of horizontal dispersion of pricing authority is advisable in countries in which the enforcement of contracts is difficult.",0
The ?Right? Consumers for Better Concepts: Identifying Consumers High in Emergent Nature to Develop New Product Concepts,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"While much research has emphasized improving current new product concept techniques, little work has focused on trait-based approaches that specify which consumers are the ?right? ones to use in the new product development process, particularly in the consumer goods industry. The authors propose that the right consumers to use possess what they call an ?emergent nature,? defined as the unique capability to imagine or envision how concepts might be developed so that they will be successful in the mainstream marketplace. The authors draw on research on personality theory and information-processing styles to support their conceptualization and develop and validate a highly reliable scale to measure emergent nature (Study 1). In subsequent multipart studies, they show in both group (Studies 2a?2c) and individual (Studies 3a and 3b) settings across two distinct product categories that consumers high in emergent nature are able to develop product concepts that mainstream consumers find significantly more appealing and useful than concepts developed by typical, lead user, or even innovative consumers.",1
Bayesian Prediction in Hybrid Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The authors propose a general model that includes the effects of discrete and continuous heterogeneity as well as self-stated and derived attribute importance in hybrid conjoint studies. Rather than use the self-stated importances as prior information, as has been done in several previous approaches, the authors consider them data and therefore include them in the formulation of the likelihood, which helps investigate the relationship of self-stated and derived importances at the individual level. The authors formulate several special cases of the model and estimate them using the Gibbs sampler. The authors reanalyze Srinivasan and Park's (1997) data and show that the current model predicts real choices better than competing models do. The posterior credible intervals of the predictions of models with the different heterogeneity specifications overlap, so there is no clear superior specification of heterogeneity. However, when different sources of data are used?that is, full profile evaluations, self-stated importances, or both?clear differences arise in the accuracy of predictions. Moreover, the authors find that including the self-stated importances in the likelihood leads to much better predictions than does considering them prior information.",1
Constraining Ideas: How Seeing Ideas of Others Harms Creativity in Open Innovation,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Open innovation contests that display all submitted ideas to participants are a popular way for firms to generate ideas. In such contest-based ideation, the authors show that seeing numerous competitive ideas of others harms, rather than stimulates, creative performance (Study 1). Others? competitive prior ideas interfere with idea generation, as new ideas need to be differentiated from the preceding ones to be original. Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals? perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas? harmful influence (Study 5). These results illustrate viable ways to improve contest-based ideation outcomes merely by changing how competitive prior ideas are presented.",1
The Service?Profit Chain: A Meta-Analytic Test of a Comprehensive Theoretical Framework,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The service?profit chain (SPC) has served as a prominent guidepost for service managers and researchers alike. This meta-analysis provides the first comprehensive test of the SPC, showing that all the proposed links are statistically significant and substantial. However, the effect sizes vary considerably, partly according to the type of service provided. Meta-analytic structural equation models show that internal service quality translates into service performance through various mechanisms beyond employee satisfaction, and they highlight the importance of the service encounter and customer relationship characteristics for customer responses. The findings not only indicate the need to integrate complementary paths in the SPC framework but also challenge the implicit SPC rationale that firms should always maximize employee satisfaction and external service quality to optimize firm performance.",0
Motivating Sales Reps for Innovation Selling in Different Cultures,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Innovation commercialization, an important managerial challenge, depends heavily on the sales force for its success. However, little empirical research has examined how firms should direct sales reps in this task in a global, multicultural context. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study investigates how to motivate sales reps for innovation selling in different cultures with various financial and nonfinancial steering instruments. The authors collected data in two waves from sales reps in 38 countries on four continents, making this study one of the largest international investigations in sales research. Results reveal that steering instruments should correspond closely with reps? national culture in terms of power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. For example, findings show that whereas individualism strengthens the positive relationship between variable compensation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation, power distance and uncertainty avoidance weaken this relationship. Results also reveal that long-term orientation strengthens the positive relationship between supervisor appreciation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation.",0
"The Influence of Anxiety: Ephebes, ?pes, Posterity, and Preposterity in the World of Stephen Brown",Journal of Marketing,2000,"The author responds to a recent article in which Stephen Brown compares the work of Ted Levitt and Morris Holbrook, casts the two into a precursor?ephebe relationship, and concludes that they are ?father and son, one and the same.? Although honored by this comparison, the author mentions certain ways in which Brown's interpretations appear to distort his intentions as an author.",0
Online Reputation Mechanisms and the Decreasing Value of Chain Affiliation,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This article investigates the value of business format franchising and how it is changing in response to a large increase in consumer information provided by online reputation mechanisms. Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms? ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews. Finally, the correlation between firm revenue and chain-wide reputation is decreasing, whereas the correlation with individual hotel reputation is increasing.",1
Structural Modeling of Success Factors in Exporting: Cross-Validation and Further Development of an Export Performance Model,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Empirical studies in export performance research are characterized by vastly empiricist and eclectic research designs. Partial models?i.e., models that investigate selected determinants of export performance?are symptomatic of this stream of research. Structural modeling techniques allow for the analysis of complex relations, which integrate a vast number of success factors into an extensive model in order to avoid over-emphasis of single determinants and to conduct an integrative investigation of different bundles of variables. In this article, the cross-validation and further development of a structural model for the prediction of export performance that was recently conceived in Austria is outlined.",0
The Influence of Avatars on Online Consumer Shopping Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2006,"An impediment to Web-based retail sales is the impersonal nature of Web-based shopping. A solution to this problem is to use an avatar to deliver product information. An avatar is a graphic representation that can be animated by means of computer technology. Study 1 shows that using an avatar sales agent leads to more satisfaction with the retailer, a more positive attitude toward the product, and a greater purchase intention. Study 2 shows that an attractive avatar is a more effective sales agent at moderate levels of product involvement, but an expert avatar is a more effective sales agent at high levels of product involvement.",0
Marketing Performance Measurement Systems: Does Comprehensiveness Really Improve Performance?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Comprehensive performance measurement systems such as the balanced scorecard have received considerable attention in marketing. However, whether and under which circumstances comprehensiveness as a performance measurement system property is desirable and contributes to firm performance is still a subject of debate in research and practice. To address this issue, the authors use dyadic field data from marketing managers and management accounting executives and extend prior work by developing and testing a more complex, contingency-based model. The empirical results confirm the developed framework. In particular, the results show that the relationship of comprehensiveness in a marketing performance measurement system to firm performance is conditional. Marketing alignment and market-based knowledge mediate this relationship, depending on marketing strategy, marketing complexity, and market dynamism. These insights explain mixed findings of previous research and provide important implications for research and managerial practice.",0
A Marketing Perspective on Mergers and Acquisitions: How Marketing Integration Affects Postmerger Performance,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Previous research on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has neglected marketing issues by and large. In this article, the authors examine the effects of postmerger integration in marketing (extent and speed of marketing integration) on M&A performance, as mediated by integration outcomes (magnitude of cost savings and market-related performance). Results from a survey of 232 horizontal M&A show that market-related performance after the merger or acquisition has a much stronger impact on financial performance than does cost savings. In addition, the authors find that the extent of integration is beneficial in terms of cost savings but detrimental in terms of market-related performance. Finally, they identify variables that moderate the relationships being considered.",0
Governance of International Business Relationships: A Cross-Cultural Study on Alternative Governance Modes,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"The authors examine the effects of both transnationality (cross-border versus domestic exchange) and national culture (U.S. versus German buyers) on the use of three primary modes of governance: (1) the market mechanism, (2) trust, and (3) formal contracts. Drawing on theory, the authors develop a series of hypotheses. Then, they test the model on a sample of more than 500 buyer?supplier relationships. The results show that transnationality and culture both affect the choice of governance modes.",0
"Customer Prioritization: Does it Pay off, and how Should it be Implemented?",Journal of Marketing,2008,"It seems to be common sense that to increase profits, firms should prioritize customers (i.e., focus their efforts on the most important customers). However, such a strategy might have substantial negative effects on firms? relationships with customers treated at a low priority level. Prior research does not indicate satisfactorily whether and how customer prioritization pays off. Moreover, although customer prioritization may be strongly present in firms? marketing strategies, firms frequently fail to implement such a strategy. Therefore, it is also important to investigate empirically by which means firms can facilitate implementation. The authors address both issues and conduct a cross-industry study with 310 firms from business-to-consumer and business-to-business contexts together with two independent validation samples. The results show that customer prioritization ultimately leads to higher average customer profitability and a higher return on sales because it (1) affects relationships with top-tier customers positively but does not affect relationships with bottom-tier customers and (2) reduces marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the ability to assess customer profitability, the quality of customer information, selective organizational alignment, selective senior-level involvement, and selective elaboration of planning and control all positively moderate the link between a firm's prioritization strategy and actual customer prioritization.",0
Measuring and Managing Consumer Sentiment in an Online Community Environment,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"As social media and virtual communities increase in popularity, the spread of word of mouth becomes easier, challenging firms to measure and manage the success of marketing initiatives in online community environments. This research examines how consumers react to firms' active participation in consumer-to-consumer conversations in an online community setting. The authors develop a tailored community-matched measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than 115,000 consumer posts from ten online forums with active firm participation. The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment. These findings provide insights for marketing performance measurement and resource allocation in online communities.",1
How Organizational Complaint Handling Drives Customer Loyalty: An Analysis of the Mechanistic and the Organic Approach,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This article addresses how an organization's complaint management affects customer justice evaluations and, in turn, customer satisfaction and loyalty. In delineating an organization's complaint management, the authors draw a distinction between two fundamental approaches, the mechanistic approach (based on establishing guidelines) and the organic approach (based on creating a favorable internal environment). The empirical analysis is based on a dyadic data set that contains managerial assessments of companies? complaint management and complaining customers? assessments with respect to perceived justice, satisfaction, and loyalty. Findings indicate that though both the mechanistic and the organic approach significantly influence complaining customers? assessments, the mechanistic approach has a stronger total impact. Moreover, the study provides evidence of a primarily complementary relationship between the two approaches. Another key facet of the study is related to the moderating influences of the type of business (business-to-business versus business-to-consumer) and type of industry (service versus manufacturing). The results show that the beneficial effects of the mechanistic approach are stronger in business-to-consumer settings than in business-to-business ones and for service firms than for manufacturing firms.",0
Responsiveness to Customers and Competitors: The Role of Affective and Cognitive Organizational Systems,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Quick responses to environmental changes have become a vital success factor for today's companies. This study aims to identify the differential mechanisms that drive responsiveness to customers and responsiveness to competitors. In particular, the authors propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes between a cognitive and an affective organizational system as two important antecedents of organizational responsiveness. The results from a large-scale, cross-industry study show that the affective organizational system is more important in driving responsiveness to customers and that the cognitive organizational system is more important in driving responsiveness to competitors. Moreover, the relative importance of the cognitive system as a driver of responsiveness is greater in firms with a low market share and in markets with low entry barriers for new competitors.",0
The Role of Chief Marketing Officers for Venture Capital Funding: Endowing New Ventures with Marketing Legitimacy,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Research on new ventures has indicated that poorly conducted marketing is among the main reasons for new venture failure. To acquire urgently needed initial funding, new ventures strive to conform to investors? expectations of appropriate marketing capabilities because these capabilities may endow them with legitimacy in the eyes of potential investors. Drawing on organizational legitimacy and human resource theory, the authors argue that the characteristics of the chief marketing officer (CMO) may endow new ventures with marketing legitimacy. Employing a two-stage selection hazard rate analysis to simultaneously account for potential selection bias and right-censored observations, the authors analyze a comprehensive data set of 2,945 high-technology new ventures. Bearing in mind that this research is a first exploratory attempt to illuminate the role of marketing for new venture funding using correlational secondary data, the results indicate that CMO education, marketing experience, and industry experience are positively related to the likelihood of funding. Moreover, the relationships between CMO characteristics and funding are contingent on task-related uncertainty and industry legitimacy. These findings provide initial insights for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and public policy makers.",1
"Service Orientation of a Retailer's Business Strategy: Dimensions, Antecedents, and Performance Outcomes",Journal of Marketing,2002,"Augmenting products with services is a major way retailers have of gaining differentiation in today's competitive market. Despite its importance, this topic has received relatively little research attention. Unlike previous research, this study adopts a more comprehensive perspective on retail services by examining three important research gaps related to a service-oriented business strategy: First, the authors elaborate on the dimensions of a service-oriented business strategy and introduce a new measure of this strategy. Second, the authors examine the antecedents of a service-oriented business strategy. In practice, there appears to be considerable variability in terms of the extent to which retailers demonstrate a service orientation, but there is a major gap in the understanding of what factors influence this orientation. Third, the authors investigate the neglected link between a service-oriented business strategy and performance outcomes. To examine these three important areas, the authors conducted an empirical study of clothing and furniture retailers in both the United States and Germany. This study provides evidence for the proposed conceptualization of a service-oriented business strategy. The authors also find that the investigated antecedents account for some variance of a service-oriented business strategy, which in turn positively affects company performance in the market and thereby profitability. Furthermore, the authors discuss several important research issues as well as managerial implications and future research avenues.",0
The Thought Worlds of Marketing and Sales: Which Differences Make a Difference?,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The literature is divided on whether differences between the thought worlds of marketing and sales are deleterious or beneficial. This article empirically investigates various facets of thought-world differences and their effects on various outcomes. It confirms that, in general, differences hamper the cooperation between marketing and sales, which leads to a lower market performance of the business unit. However, some facets of thought-world differences enhance the market performance of the business unit through a direct effect that outweighs the negative effect mediated by the quality of cooperation between marketing and sales. Market performance is enhanced if one side plays the customers' advocate while the other plays the products' advocate. Market performance is also enhanced if one side plays the advocate of short-term considerations while the other plays the advocate of long-term considerations. In contrast, differences between marketing and sales in regard to product knowledge and interpersonal skills are deleterious to market performance. Thus, the kind of difference makes a difference.",0
How to Organize Pricing? Vertical Delegation and Horizontal Dispersion of Pricing Authority,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Although pricing is one of the strongest drivers of profitability, little empirical research has examined how a firm should organize pricing internally. This research draws on the information-processing view of organizational design to conceptualize a framework of how firms organize their pricing authority both within the sales function and across the sales, marketing, and finance functions. The authors find a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the vertical delegation of pricing authority and profitability as well as a positive relationship between the horizontal dispersion of pricing authority across sales, marketing, and finance and profitability. Another key finding is a positive interaction between vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion, indicating that firms need to jointly design vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion. In addition, the results identify price-related market dynamism as a moderator of the horizontal dispersion of the pricing authority?profitability relationship and emphasis on margin-based incentives as a moderator of vertical delegation of the pricing authority?profitability relationship. The authors also analyze the relationship between the organizational design of pricing authority and sales growth.",0
Configurations of Marketing and Sales: A Taxonomy,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Little is known about the interface between separate marketing units and sales units. This article develops a multidimensional model of the marketing and sales interface. The model integrates a broad range of conceptual domains, including information sharing, structural linkages, power, orientations, and knowledge of marketing and sales. The authors empirically explore the conceptual model through a cross-industry study of 337 European Union?based companies. They identify five empirical archetypes of the marketing and sales interface. The taxonomy shows that the role and characteristics of marketing and sales vary a great deal. This finding challenges existing stereotypes about marketing and sales. Finally, the article explores organizational outcomes of the five configurations. The findings suggest that the most successful configurations are characterized by strong structural linkages between marketing and sales and a high extent of market knowledge in marketing.",0
What Drives Key Informant Accuracy?,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"In an effort to establish and enhance the accuracy of key informant data, organizational survey studies are increasingly relying on triangulation techniques by including supplemental data sources that complement information acquired from key informants. Despite the growing popularity of triangulation, little guidance exists as to when and how it should be conducted. Addressing this gap, the authors develop hypotheses linking a comprehensive set of study characteristics at the construct, informant, organizational, and industry levels to key informant accuracy. Two studies test these hypotheses. The first study is a meta-analysis of triangulation applications. Using data from 127 studies published in six major marketing and management journals, the authors identify antecedents to key informant reliability. The second study, using eight multi-informant data sets, analyzes antecedents to key informant validity. The results from these studies inform survey researchers as to which conditions particularly call for the use of triangulation. The authors conclude by offering guidelines on when and how to employ triangulation techniques.",1
Customer Uncertainty following Downsizing: The Effects of Extent of Downsizing and Open Communication,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Although downsizing has become a nearly universal managerial practice, many downsizing initiatives fail. To explain this phenomenon, previous research has mainly investigated possible negative consequences for employees remaining in the firm while largely neglecting customer reactions to downsizing and the issues surrounding its implementation. The authors describe three studies analyzing how downsizing at a firm's point of customer contact affects customers and how managers can influence customer reactions through open communication. The first study, a manager study, is based on an executive survey of a sample of more than 100 downsizing projects. The other two studies are customer studies that use an experimental scenario method. Across the two methods, results show that the extent of downsizing is linked to customer uncertainty. In addition, both survey results and experimental results reveal that open downsizing communication carries substantial risks for downsizing firms. Although open communication reduces customer uncertainty if customers have strong informal ties with the firm's employees or perceive a firm's products as important, it may increase customer uncertainty in other situations.",0
Do Satisfied Customers Really Pay More? A Study of the Relationship between Customer Satisfaction and Willingness to Pay,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Two experimental studies (a lab experiment and a study involving a real usage experience over time) reveal the existence of a strong, positive impact of customer satisfaction on willingness to pay, and they provide support for a nonlinear, functional structure based on disappointment theory (i.e., an inverse S-shaped form). In addition, the second study examines dynamic aspects of the relationship and provides evidence for the stronger impact of cumulative satisfaction rather than of transaction-specific satisfaction on willingness to pay.",0
The Role of Cognition and Affect in the Formation of Customer Satisfaction: A Dynamic Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Despite the strong recognition that customer satisfaction should be viewed from a dynamic perspective, little is known about how the satisfaction judgment develops over time. Therefore, this study provides a dynamic analysis of the simultaneous influence of cognition and affect in the satisfaction formation process. The results of an experimental study based on a real consumption experience indicate that the impact of cognition on the satisfaction evaluation increases and the influence of affect decreases over time. Moreover, these effects are attenuated with inconsistent performance experiences. Finally, the study shows that the variance in customer satisfaction jointly explained by cognition and affect increases as experience accumulates.",0
Customer Satisfaction in Transnational Buyer?Supplier Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"This study analyzes customer satisfaction in buyer?supplier relationships across national boundaries (transnational business relationships) with manufacturing firms on both sides of the dyad. The analysis is based on data from 511 industrial customers from the United States and Germany, 201 of which reported on a transnational relationship. The results indicate that quality and flexibility are important antecedents of customer satisfaction. These antecedents were significantly lower in transnational relationships than in domestic ones. Using equity theory and the confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm, the authors develop alternative models for describing the relationships between customer satisfaction and its antecedents in transnational as opposed to domestic relationships. The findings reveal that there are no structural differences between transnational and domestic relationships regarding the relationships between customer satisfaction and its antecedents. Specifically, a lower level of customer satisfaction in transnational relationships is due to lower levels of the antecedents and does not constitute an effect of transnationality per se.",0
Determinants of Customer Benefits in Business-to-Business Markets: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"The authors examine the concept of customer benefits in business-to-business markets in an international context. They distinguish between core and add-on benefits, and they discuss product quality, service quality, flexibility, trust, joint action, and commitment of the supplier as determinants of these customer benefits. They base their analysis on 981 respondents in two countries. The results suggest the importance of understanding the determinants in providing customer benefits. Furthermore, the authors observe significant cultural differences with respect to the impact of different determinants on perceived customer benefits. Following a discussion of the results, the authors present managerial implications, research limitations, and directions for further research.",0
When Should the Customer Really be King? On the Optimum Level of Salesperson Customer Orientation in Sales Encounters,Journal of Marketing,2011,"In today's age of relational selling, a key challenge for salespeople is to determine the degree to which their customer-oriented behaviors drive sales performance. Therefore, this study analyzes whether a salesperson's customer orientation in sales encounters has an optimum level with regard to sales performance and customer attitudes. Using triadic data from a cross-industry survey of 56 sales managers, 195 sales representatives, and 538 customers, the authors provide strong empirical support for a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped effect of a salesperson's customer orientation on sales performance, whereas the effect of customer orientation on customer attitudes is continuously positive. Moreover, the findings reveal that the optimum level of customer orientation with regard to sales performance is higher for salespeople selling individualized products, in firms pursuing a premium price strategy, and in markets with a high degree of competitive intensity.",0
A Multiple-Layer Model of Market-Oriented Organizational Culture: Measurement Issues and Performance Outcomes,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Previous research addressing market orientation from a cultural perspective typically has used behavioral measures of this construct. Drawing on literature in the fields of organizational theory and marketing, the authors develop a multilayer model of market-oriented organizational culture. They draw an explicit distinction among values that support market orientation, norms for market orientation, artifacts indicating high and low market orientation, and market-oriented behaviors. On the basis of qualitative research and a subsequent survey, the authors develop scales for measuring the different layers of market-oriented culture and analyze relationships among the different components of market-oriented culture. Findings indicate that artifacts play a crucial role in determining behavior within organizations. Results also indicate that a market-oriented culture influences financial performance indirectly through market performance and that this relationship is stronger in highly dynamic markets.",1
Exploring Subsidiary Desire for Autonomy: A Conceptual Framework and Empirical Findings,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"In the mixed-motive dyad of the headquarters?subsidiary relationship, subsidiaries often request more autonomy than headquarters concede. To shed light on subsidiaries? desire for autonomy, the authors investigate its consequences and determinants by drawing on reactance theory to develop an integrative framework focusing on marketing decision making in subsidiaries. The authors empirically test this framework with 133 international headquarters?subsidiary dyads from 29 countries. The findings show that a subsidiary's desire for autonomy can significantly impair the headquarters?subsidiary relationship. While the centralization and importance of marketing decision making can amplify this harmful desire for autonomy, the headquarters? competence in marketing decision making can reduce this desire. Thus, to minimize subsidiaries? desire for autonomy, headquarters should credibly display high competence while allowing subsidiaries to participate in decision making whenever possible.",0
"New Product Design: Concept, Measurement, and Consequences",Journal of Marketing,2015,"Product design is a source of competitive advantage for companies and is an important driver of company performance. Drawing on an extensive literature review and consumer interviews, the authors define product design and its dimensions. Using data from three samples (6,418 U.S. consumers and 1,083 and 583 European consumers), the authors develop and validate a new scale to measure product design along the dimensions of aesthetics, functionality, and symbolism. In addition, they investigate the impact of these design dimensions on purchase intention, word of mouth, and willingness to pay. The results indicate that the design dimensions positively influence willingness to pay and also have a positive effect on purchase intention and word of mouth, both directly and indirectly through brand attitude.",0
Managing Dynamics in a Customer Portfolio,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.",0
Corporate Social Responsibility in Business-to-Business Markets: How Organizational Customers Account for Supplier Corporate Social Responsibility Engagement,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Despite the high relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in current business practice and the considerable research on CSR outcomes in consumer markets, investigations of its influence on organizational business relationships are scarce. Relying on instrumental stakeholder theory, the authors develop and empirically test a framework of the influence of a supplier's CSR engagement on organizational customer outcomes. Findings from an examination of 200 cross-industry supplier?customer dyads reveal positive effects of two facets of a supplier's CSR efforts on customer loyalty through distinct mechanisms. Business practice CSR fosters customers' trust, whereas philanthropic CSR strengthens customer?company identification. The authors distinguish a supplier's actual CSR engagement and customers' perception of these CSR activities. In addition, they consider central contingency factors reflecting uncertainty and dependence in business-to-business relationships that determine the effectiveness of CSR.",0
"Marketing Excellence: Nature, Measurement, and Investor Valuations",Journal of Marketing,2020,"Marketing excellence is a foundational principle for the discipline that is gaining increasing attention among managers and investors. Despite this, the nature of marketing excellence and its effectiveness remain unclear. This research offers insight by addressing two questions: (1) How do managers understand and exercise marketing excellence? and (2) How do investors evaluate marketing excellence? Study 1 merges insights from 39 in-depth interviews with senior executives and secondary data from 150 firm strategies to find that marketing excellence is a strategy type focused on achieving organic growth by executing priorities related to the marketing ecosystem, end user, and marketing agility. Study 2 quantifies the impact of marketing excellence on firm value by using a machine learning algorithm and text analysis through an original dictionary to classify the text from 8,317 letters to shareholders in 1,727 U.S. firm annual reports. Calendar-time portfolio models reveal abnormal one-year returns of up to 8.58% for marketing excellence?returns that outpace those associated with market orientation and marketing capabilities. Findings offer guidance to managers, educators, and investors regarding how marketing excellence manifests?paving the way for the allocation of firm resources to ensure that marketing drives organic growth.",0
"Firm Value Creation through Major Channel Expansions: Evidence from an Event Study in the United States, Germany, and China",Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although changes to the channel system are among a firm's most critical decisions, prior research has neglected to examine the impact of channel expansions on firm value. This article investigates whether a firm's announcement of an increase in distribution intensity or the establishment of a new channel influences firm value. The authors also consider the moderating role of context-specific firm, market, and channel strategy contingencies. They test their hypotheses with an event study of 240 announcements of major channel expansions in the United States, Germany, and China. The results indicate that channel expansions affect firm value (i.e., through abnormal stock returns). However, the two types of channel expansions affect firm value differently. Whereas the establishment of a new channel positively influences firm value, reactions to an increase in distribution intensity are highly contingent. For example, firms operating in exceedingly turbulent or competitive markets experience firm value reductions in response to an increase in distribution intensity. Notably, the same two environmental contingencies enhance firm value when the firm establishes a new channel.",0
Design and Governance of Multichannel Sales Systems: Financial Performance Consequences in Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Multichannel sales systems in business-to-business markets vary substantially in their designs and thereby either attenuate or aggravate agency conflicts between manufacturers and sales partners. Drawing on multiple agency theory, the authors introduce direct and indirect channel usage as focal design dimensions of multichannel sales systems and investigate each channel?s performance effects using a matched manufacturer?sales partner data set. Whereas direct channel usage predominantly lowers agency conflicts in terms of information asymmetry and sales partner moral hazard, indirect channel usage amplifies moral hazard concerns. How those sales partner effects translate into manufacturer performance outcomes critically depends on governance mechanisms, confirming predictions from governance value analysis: formalization enhances performance outcomes for manufacturers in the case of indirect channel usage but diminishes performance in the case of direct channel usage. The authors observe converse effects for centralization and information exchange: centralization and information exchange enhance outcomes of direct channel usage but diminish outcomes of indirect channel usage. The focal managerial implication is that managers must align the design of their multichannel sales systems with effective governance mechanisms.",1
Implementing the Marketing Concept at the Employee-Customer Interface: The Role of Customer Need Knowledge,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Although the identification of customer needs constitutes a cornerstone of the marketing concept, the accuracy of frontline employees? perceptions of customer needs has never been examined in a systematic manner. Following research in social cognition, this article introduces the concept of ?customer need knowledge? (CNK), which describes the extent to which a frontline employee can accurately identify a given customer's hierarchy of needs. The results of two large-scale, multilevel investigations involving data from three different levels (customers, employees, and managers) demonstrate the importance of CNK for the provision of customer satisfaction and customer value. In particular, CNK fully mediates the influence of employees? customer orientation and cognitive empathy on these customer outcomes. Moreover, whereas the length of the relationship between an employee and a particular customer enhances CNK, a large age discrepancy in relation to the customer decreases employees? level of CNK.",0
Social Identity and the Service-Profit Chain,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The conventional service-profit chain (SPC) proposes that a firm's financial performance can be improved through a path that connects employee satisfaction, customer orientation, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. In this article, a complementary SPC that is built on both a conventional path and a social identity-based path is introduced. The latter SPC path centrally builds on customer- and employee-company identification as a core construct. Using a large-scale triadic data set that includes data from employees, customers, and firms, the authors find strong support for the extended SPC, which accounts for important customer (loyalty and willingness to pay) and firm (financial performance) outcomes. In addition, the effects of company identification exist incrementally beyond the effects of the conventional SPC path.",0
Looking beyond the Horizon: How to Approach the Customers? Customers in Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Suppliers in business-to-business (B2B) markets often approach their customers? customers with marketing activities. However, marketing research lacks an integrative conceptualization of this phenomenon. The authors address this void by conceptualizing a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers. Drawing on a literature review and a qualitative empirical study, the authors identify three indirect customer marketing approaches: direct customer downstream support, cooperative indirect customer marketing, and independent indirect customer marketing. They also propose external (value chain?related) and internal (B2B supplier?related) moderators that influence the relationship between a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers and its financial performance. The authors argue that although power constellations and product value contribution in the value chain determine the specific indirect customer marketing approach that will lead to financial success, internal professionalization of a B2B supplier's organizational structure and processes further strengthens the positive financial impact of each approach.",0
A Configurational Perspective on Key Account Management,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Most firms struggle with the challenge of managing their key customer accounts. There is a significant gap between the importance of this organizational design problem in practice and the research attention paid to it. Sound academic research on key account management (KAM) is limited and fragmented. Drawing on research on KAM and team selling, the authors develop an integrative conceptualization of KAM and define key constructs in four areas: (1) activities, (2) actors, (3) resources, and (4) approach formalization. Adopting a configurational perspective to organizational research, the authors then use numerical taxonomy to empirically identify eight prototypical KAM approaches on the basis of a cross-industry, cross-national study. The results show significant performance differences among the approaches. Overall, the article builds a bridge between marketing organization research and relationship marketing research.",0
"Brand Name Translation: Language Constraints, Product Attributes, and Consumer Perceptions in East and Southeast Asia",Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The primary purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between foreign brand name translation and product-related cues?such as physical quality, perceived origin, and brand name?on consumers? perceived quality, price, and purchase intentions. In translations from alphabetic to character-based languages such as Mandarin, two generic methods of brand name translation are available: (1) direct translation for the meaning of the brand name and (2) phonetic translation for the pronunciation of the brand name. The results from a series of structurally related experiments designed to investigate the effects of brand name translation in a cross-cultural context indicate that for an unknown brand, a phonetic translation may be mandatory, whereas for an existing strong brand name, it may be best to retain the original name.",0
The Effects of Consumer Prior Knowledge and Processing Strategies on Judgments,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Four studies examine how consumers? prior knowledge of a product category and the way they process product information affect evaluation. Consumers with extensive prior knowledge of a category evaluate the brand more favorably when the presentation of the product information prompts a sense of progress rather than facilitating a detailed assessment (Studies 1 and 2), as well as when the information presentation involves a high level of construal rather than a low level (Studies 3 and 4). Consumers with limited domain knowledge exhibit opposite outcomes. The subjective experience of processing fluency mediates these effects. The findings suggest that evaluations are more favorable when there is a fit between prior knowledge and message processing than when fit is absent.",1
The Perils of Category Management: The Effect of Product Assortment on Multicategory Purchase Incidence,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Retailers determine the assortment for a mix of product categories in a particular space (e.g., the checkout aisle, endcaps, freezer space). Within such a ?target? space, shoppers are exposed to a selection of product categories that are not necessarily correlated in consumption. In this article, the authors examine whether the assortment of one category affects consumers? purchase incidence decision in another, independent category that shares a common display space (e.g., frozen meals and ice cream). They use a multivariate probit model of purchase incidence and incorporate assortment variety captured by an entropy measure. Results from analyses of IRI data and an online experiment provide strong evidence that consumers are less likely to purchase from a category of a given assortment when it is presented with another category assortment of greater variety and that this effect is driven by the display proximity. Furthermore, results from an eye-tracking study indicate consumers? allocation of limited attention to category assortments as an explanation for the finding. This work serves as one of the first studies to document the impact of product assortment beyond a focal category, and the results highlight a limitation of individual category management when grocery retailers make product assortment decisions.",0
The Role of Reciprocity in Clarifying the Performance Payoff of Relational Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors theorize that the inconsistencies in prior research regarding the relational behavior?performance relationship arise from the type of reciprocity the firm internalizes. The results of a longitudinal study of 284 buyer?supplier relationships indicate that relational behavior enhances financial performance when what is exchanged does not need to be directly comparable with what was received (i.e., heteromorphic equivalence reciprocity) or can be returned over a longer time horizon (i.e., long-term immediacy reciprocity). Moreover, relational behavior diminishes financial performance when what is exchanged must be directly comparable in form (i.e., homeomorphic equivalence reciprocity) or returned over a short time horizon (i.e., short-term immediacy reciprocity). The authors further conclude that a longitudinal interaction effect model provides a more accurate understanding of the relational behavior?performance relationship when compared with a cross-sectional interaction effect model, because it minimizes the unobserved heterogeneity effect, thus strengthening causal inference.",1
Reciprocity in Relationship Marketing: A Cross-Cultural Examination of the Effects of Equivalence and Immediacy on Relationship Quality and Satisfaction with Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Effective relationship marketing (RM) in a firm's global operations necessitates that the underlying aspect of reciprocity operate consistently across markets. Unfortunately, few studies have empirically examined the role of reciprocity in RM, let alone whether the effects of reciprocity in RM are universal across national cultures. To address these limitations, the authors examine reciprocity as a multidimensional norm whose dimensions of equivalence (what is exchanged) and immediacy (when the exchange occurs) influence relationship quality and satisfaction with performance in cross-border U.S.?Japanese interfirm relationships. The results indicate that the effects of reciprocity on relationship quality are conditional on national culture. Specifically, uncertainty avoidance positively moderates the positive effect of equivalence on relationship quality, while individualism and short-term orientation positively moderate the negative effect of immediacy on relationship quality. Moreover, a supplemental analysis indicates that the key mediating variable RM model may not hold across all cultures when predicting satisfaction with performance. These findings underscore the importance of adapting RM strategies across national cultures and provide managers with recommendations for developing high-quality cross-border buyer?seller relationships.",0
The Modern Advertising Agency Selection Contest: A Case for Stipends to New Participants,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"In the modern advertising agency selection contest, each participating agency specifies not only its proposed creative campaign but also the budget required to purchase the agreed-on media. The advertiser selects the agency that offers the best combination of creative quality and media cost, similar to conducting a score auction. To participate in the contest, each agency needs to incur an up-front bid-preparation cost to cover the development of a customized creative campaign. Agency industry literature has called for the advertiser to fully reimburse such costs to all agencies that enter the contest. The authors analyze the optimal stipend policy of an advertiser facing agencies with asymmetric bid-preparation costs, such that the incumbent agency faces a lower bid-preparation cost than a competitor agency entering the contest. The authors show that reimbursing bid-preparation costs in full is never optimal, nor is reimbursing any part of the incumbent's bid-preparation cost. However, a stipend that is strictly lower than the competitor's bid-preparation cost can benefit the advertiser under certain conditions. The authors provide a sufficient condition (in terms of the distribution of agency values to the advertiser) for such a new-business stipend to benefit the advertiser.",1
The Trade-off between Customer and Technology Orientations: Impact on Innovation Capabilities and Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Technological exporters are constantly challenged by the trade-off between two types of strategic orientations: customer and technology. Nonetheless, research directly addressing this topic is scarce, and few recommendations exist about the best orientation to emphasize. Using two respondents in the same firm, the export manager and the research-and-development manager, the authors find that customer orientation is as important as technological orientation in the development of exploratory innovation capabilities. However, when past performance is poor, customer orientation has a greater role. Exporters with poor past performance may achieve higher export performance levels by focusing more on customers than on technology. Conversely, firms performing well may risk export performance if they ignore technology orientation. These firms also need to maintain high levels of customer orientation.",0
Measuring Rank-Based Utility in Contests: The Effect of Disclosure Schemes,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article studies how the incentive structures and disclosure schemes of a contest affect the contestants? intrinsic motivations. Specifically, the authors measure the effects of these design decisions on two types of nonmonetary rank-based utility: self-generated and peer-induced. They run a set of laboratory experiments involving contests under various reward spreads and disclosure schemes. First, they find that virtually all commonly adopted disclosure schemes generate positive peer-induced rank-based utility. However, the relative performances of alternative disclosure schemes can depend on the spread of contest rewards and the number of contestants. Second, being recognized as a winner confers positive peer-induced rank-based utility; moreover, being recognized as the sole first-place winner or as one among multiple winners does not produce significantly different peer-induced utility. Third, ?shaming? by disclosing the identity of contestants ranked at the bottom leads to negative peer-induced rank-based utility, but the effect is marginally insignificant. Finally, a smaller spread of contest rewards consistently results in higher levels of self-generated rank-based utility. These results underscore the importance of jointly choosing incentive structures and disclosure schemes.",1
Buyer?Supplier Contracts versus Joint Ventures: Determinants and Consequences of Transaction Structure,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"When a buyer firm and a supplier firm plan to transact, what factors drive their choice of mechanism to govern the relationship? Focusing on contract-governed versus joint venture?governed relationships, the authors present a theoretical framework that specifies the conditions that make one or the other form of relationship structure more appropriate. This study was designed to address potential limitations regarding measurement, financial consequences, and context in the extant literature. The authors employ measures derived from Standard & Poor's Compustat financial database and an overall measure of firm reputation to examine empirically differences in firm characteristics across the two types of relationships. To examine the financial consequences of relationship structure, the authors use event-study techniques that tie stock price reactions to the governance mechanism choice. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers are more likely to form a joint venture (versus simple contract) when (1) the supplier's degree of asset specificity is high, (2) monitoring the supplier's behavior is difficult, and (3) the supplier has a poorer reputation. The authors find that vertical joint ventures (between buyers and suppliers) are economically similar to contracts, to the extent that abnormal wealth gains go solely to the supplier firms. Horizontal joint ventures (partners are at the same level of the value chain), however, provide bilateral, synergistic wealth gains. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers can use joint ventures to reduce certain governance problems rather than to gain synergies.",1
Cross-Unit Competition for a Market Charter: The Enduring Influence of Structure,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Marketing strategists who operate in turbulent markets face a competitive landscape marked by volatility and evolving market structures. As customer requirements change, an organization that stays in alignment with its markets will form new business units or alter the market charters of existing business units. In a longitudinal study, the authors traced the structural realignments that accompanied a Fortune-500 firm's entry into the Internet market. As the charter moved from a freshly created unit to an established business unit, the authors found support for the prediction that the former organizational structure will continue to shape the identity, beliefs, and social ties of managers. The study highlights the structural, social, and cognitive factors that must be managed as corporate decision makers search for the best strategy?structure fit for an emerging market opportunity.",0
Broadening the Scope of Reference Price Advertising Research: A Field Study of Consumer Shopping Involvement,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The current understanding of reference pricing requires broadening to reflect contemporary advertising practices and shopping behavior. A content analysis of 13,594 newspaper retail advertisements reveals that it is uncommon for reference pricing to be used alone in advertisements: 87.2% of the advertisements featuring reference pricing also include limited-time availability (i.e., ?Three days only!?) or sale announcements in the headline or copy. Using dual-process theories of persuasion as a conceptual framework, the authors conduct three field experiments that compare the conditions under which the use of limited-time availability and sale announcements in advertisements that feature reference prices affects consumer price perceptions and store shopping intentions. The findings yield three insights for reference price advertising. First, reference pricing results in favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions only when consumers are shopping for a product. Second, when consumers are shopping for a product, reference pricing paired with limited-time availability results in more favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions than the use of either technique alone. Third, the use of sale announcements and limited-time availability in reference price advertisements has a favorable effect on price perceptions and store shopping intentions when consumers are not shopping for a product.",0
Gremlins in the Data: Identifying the Information Content of Research Subjects,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Empirical demand functions, such as those from choice-based conjoint analyses, are critical to many aspects of marketing. Approaches have been developed to ensure that research subjects provide honest and thoughtful responses. However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject?s utility function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances. The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task. ?Gremlins,? in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power. This approach provides an automated way to determine which respondents are relevant. The authors discuss the conceptual and modeling framework and illustrate the method using both simulated and commercial data.",1
The Prominence Effect in Shanghai Apartment Prices,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"A field study conducted in Shanghai identified a robust inconsistency between real estate developers' desired sales pattern (selling all apartments in a building at similar rates) and the actual sales pattern (selling good apartments faster). The authors explain this inconsistency using Tversky, Sattath, and Slovic's (1988) prominence principle, according to which buyers, who were in a choice mode, weighed the desirability of floors more heavily than developers, who were in a matching mode when setting prices. This explanation is corroborated by controlled experiments involving potential home buyers and professional real estate price setters. The research relates an intriguing anomaly originally found in paper-and-pencil surveys to a real-world issue in one of the world's most active markets. These findings also have implications for issues beyond real estate markets.",1
"Wealth, Warmth, and Well-Being: Whether Happiness is Relative or Absolute Depends on Whether it is about Money, Acquisition, or Consumption",Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"A central question in consumer and happiness research is whether happiness depends on absolute or relative levels of wealth and consumption. To address this question, the authors evaluate a finer level than overall happiness and distinguish three specific types of happiness: with money, with the acquisition of an item, and with the consumption of an item. They find that happiness with money and with acquisition is relative and that happiness with consumption can be either absolute or relative, depending on whether the consumption is inherently evaluable or not. Including both lab and field data, this research yields implications for how to increase consumer happiness from one generation to the next.",1
Lay Rationalism: Individual Differences in using Reason versus Feelings to Guide Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"People have a lay notion of rationality?that is, the notion of using reason rather than feelings to guide decisions. Yet people differ in the degree to which they actually base their decisions on reason versus feelings. This individual difference variable is potentially general and important but is largely overlooked. The present research (1) introduces the construct of lay rationalism to capture this individual difference variable and distinguishes it from other individual difference variables; (2) develops a short, easy-to-implement scale to measure lay rationalism and demonstrates the validity and reliability of the scale; and (3) shows that lay rationalism, as measured by the scale, can predict a variety of consumer-relevant behaviors, including product preferences, savings decisions, and donation behaviors.",1
Measuring Global Brand Equity Using Cross-National Survey Data,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This article presents a newly developed survey-based method for the measurement of customer-based brand equity in a cross-national context. The proposed national brand equity (NBE) model decomposes customer-based brand equity into two components: measured and unmeasured brand equity. Whereas the measured component of brand equity identifies the effectiveness of individual benefit associations across the globe, the unmeasured component captures the value that is attached to the brand but not measured by the commonly elicited associations. The author applies the NBE model to 18 brands across 16 worldwide automobile markets, which provides opportunities for assessing the applicability of the proposed model. Furthermore, in response to the trend of increasing brand globalization, the author develops a model of global brand equity to assess a brand's value relative to that of its global competitors. Based on the NBE model, the global brand equity model incorporates national weighting factors in the aggregation of NBE across countries. The resultant aggregation yields a global brand equity index, which provides practical applications for benchmarking against the best brand and serves as a good indicator of a brand's relative value in the global market.",0
Identifying Brand Image Dimensionality and Measuring the Degree of Brand Globalization: A Cross-National Study,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The author aims to answer two questions related to brand globalization: (1) whether the pattern of brand image dimensionality is similar across international markets and (2) how cohesive a brand image perception is in a global market. Results from a 20-country, 70-region study provide concrete evidence that supports the applicability of the proposed benefit-based multidimensional image structure that corresponds to consumers? sensory, utilitarian, and symbolic and economic need at both the global and the national level. On the basis of the identified image dimensions, the author proposes an alternative approach to measuring the degree of global brand image cohesiveness as an indicator of brand globalization. Global brand image cohesiveness is calculated on the basis of the summation of Euclidean distances between the column score of image dimensions of the home country (i.e., initial market) and that of foreign countries. Furthermore, nations are clustered on the basis of these column scores, and the resultant clusters correspond approximately to groups of countries that share similar levels of economic development, cultural dimension, or geographic distance, which suggests that national characteristics affect brand image perceptions. The findings provide implications for the practice of global brand image management.",0
Decomposing the Impact of Advertising: Augmenting Sales with Online Search Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Unlike sales data, data on intermediate stages of the purchase funnel (e.g., how many consumers have searched for information about a product before purchase) are much more difficult to acquire. Consequently, most advertising response models have focused directly on sales and ignored other purchase funnel activities. The authors demonstrate, in the context of the U.S. automotive market, how consumer online search volume data from Google Trends can be combined with sales data to decompose advertising's overall impact into two underlying components: its impacts on (1) generating consumer interest in prepurchase information search and (2) converting that interest into sales. The authors show that this decompositional approach, implemented through a novel state-space model that simultaneously examines sales and search volumes, offers important advantages over a benchmark model that considers sales data alone. First, the approach improves goodness-of-fit, both in and out of sample. Second, it improves diagnosticity by distinguishing advertising effectiveness in interest generation from its effectiveness in interest conversion. Third, the authors find that overall advertising elasticity can be biased if researchers consider only sales data.",1
Searching for Experience on the Web: An Empirical Examination of Consumer Behavior for Search and Experience Goods,Journal of Marketing,2009,"By lowering the costs of gathering and sharing information and offering new ways to learn about products before purchase, the Internet reduces traditional distinctions between search and experience goods. At the same time, differences in the type of information sought for search and experience goods can precipitate differences in the process through which consumers gather information and make decisions online. A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers? perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and experience goods, but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular, experience goods involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth (total number of pages) of search than search goods. In addition, free riding (purchasing from a retailer other than the primary source of product information) is less frequent for experience than for search goods. Finally, the presence of product reviews from other consumers and multimedia that enable consumers to interact with products before purchase has a greater effect on consumer search and purchase behavior for experience than for search goods.",0
Wal-Mart's Impact on Supplier Profits,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Previous academic research on the expansion of dominant retailers such as Wal-Mart has examined implications for incumbent retailers, consumers, and the local community. Little is known, however, about Wal-Mart's influence on suppliers' performance. Manufacturers suggest that Wal-Mart uses its power to squeeze their profits. In this article, the authors study the validity of this claim. They investigate the underlying mechanisms that may cause changes in manufacturer profits following Wal-Mart market entry. The data contain information on supplier interactions with retail stores, including Wal-Mart, for a period of five years. They find that postentry supplier profits increased by 18% on average, whereas profits derived from incumbent retailers decreased only marginally. Their results show that wholesale prices are not the main driver of postentry supplier profit changes; market expansion is. They observe a significant increase in shipments to 50% of markets studied. Furthermore, their analyses demonstrate that supplier shipment and profit increases are highest for markets in which incumbents offer a wide variety of products and carry items that Wal-Mart does not sell.",1
"Social Information Avoidance: When, why, and how it is Costly in Goal Pursuit",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Consumers nowadays have easy and rich access to information about social others who are pursuing goals similar to their own (e.g., through a Fitbit device, the Endomondo mobile app, stickK.com). This research focuses on objective social information during goal striving (e.g., performance data and progress information of others) and shows that this information may not always be welcome. The author finds that when people are in the middle of a goal pursuit journey (vs. when they have just begun or are about to complete their goal), to circumvent potentially negative comparisons, they avoid information about social referents who are relevant (pursuing the same goal), proximal (in the same stage of goal pursuit), and superior. Head turn frequency, eye movements, and consumers? direct choices in the lab and in the field are used to document a U-shaped pattern of information avoidance behavior, which paradoxically contributes to the phenomenon whereby goal pursuers become ?stuck in the middle? of their pursuits. These findings connect the information avoidance literature with the psychophysics of goal pursuit and shed light on the questions of when and why people may be undermining their goal striving by avoiding relevant, motivating social information.",1
Motivational Consequences of Perceived Velocity in Consumer Goal Pursuit,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors explore the interplay between consumers? progress levels toward attaining a goal and the perceived velocity in progressing toward the goal to determine consumers? motivation for further goal pursuit. The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question ?Can I get there?? Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question ?When will I get there?? and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment. Empirical evidence from lab and field experiments supports this hypothesis.",1
Cueing Morality: The Effect of High-Pitched Music on Healthy Choice,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Managers often use music as a marketing tool. For example, in advertising, they use music to intensify emotions; in service settings, they use slow music to boost relaxation and classical music to convey sophistication. In this article, the authors posit a novel effect?higher-pitched music can boost healthier choices. Recognizing that many perceptual characteristics of higher pitch (e.g., lighter, elevated) are conceptually associated with morality, they theorize that listening to higher- (vs. lower-) pitched music can cue morality. Furthermore, thoughts about morality can prompt moral self-perceptions and, in turn, thoughts about ?good? behaviors, including healthy choices. Thus, listening to higher-pitched music may increase healthier choices. Employing field settings and online studies, the authors find that listening to higher-pitched music increases consumers? likelihood to choose healthy options (Studies 1, 3, and 5), choose lower-calorie foods (Study 2), and engage in health-boosting activities (Study 4). This effect arises because high pitch raises the salience of morality thoughts (Studies 4 and 5). The article concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.",0
The Impact of Death-Related Media Information on Consumer Value Orientation and Scope Sensitivity,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This research examines how incidental exposure to death-related information in the media affects consumers? value orientation and scope sensitivity to marketing stimuli. Five studies demonstrate that, in contrast to thoughts about one's own mortality, exposure to death-related information in the media can shift consumers? focus from extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that exposure to death-related media information will generate effects similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety. The authors discuss implications and possible extensions.",1
The Sleepy Consumer and Variety Seeking,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Sleepiness, the subjective feeling of the propensity to fall asleep, is a common, everyday experience that can be induced by various factors, such as sleep quality, sleep deprivation, ingestion of certain substances, or belief about how much sleep a person needs. Despite its prevalence, sleepiness and its influence on consumption behavior have rarely been linked in the research to date. The present research helps fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer variety-seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness. The effect of sleepiness on variety seeking uncovered in this research is somewhat nonintuitive, in the sense that, a priori, one might expect sleepiness to be more likely to decrease rather than increase exploratory behavior. The authors discuss implications of the findings for different research areas and for marketing practice.",1
What Has Marketing Learned from Richard Johnson?,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Richard Johnson has had a remarkable career in an era that integrated the use of computers and mathematical models into marketing research. This article summarizes his contributions in terms of theoretical advances, practical solutions, and the development of a culture that links the academic and practitioner worlds. The author speculates on the personality traits that made Johnson so successful and ways that his critical roles can be fulfilled by others in the future.",1
A Topical History of JMR,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Using subject indexes and text mining of author abstracts, the authors track the evolution of content in Journal of Marketing Research since its inception 50 years ago. These data reveal that the journal has expanded beyond its initial emphasis on marketing research methods and advertising to increase its coverage of other substantive topics and consumer behavior. Moreover, a joint space of topics and editors reveals that editorial orientations appear largely evolutionary rather than revolutionary and that a major shift in journal coverage occurs at the time Marketing Science began publication. The authors conclude their analysis with several policy recommendations.",1
Let's be Honest about the Attraction Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) and Yang and Lynn (2014) argue that the conditions for obtaining the attraction effect are so restrictive that the practical validity of the attraction effect should be questioned. In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.",1
Driving Brand Engagement Through Online Social Influencers: An Empirical Investigation of Sponsored Blogging Campaigns,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Influencer marketing is prevalent in firm strategies, yet little is known about the factors that drive success of online brand engagement at different stages of the consumer purchase funnel. The findings suggest that sponsored blogging affects online engagement (e.g., posting comments, liking a brand) differently depending on blogger characteristics and blog post content, which are further moderated by social media platform type and campaign advertising intent. When a sponsored post occurs on a blog, high blogger expertise is more effective when the advertising intent is to raise awareness versus increase trial. However, source expertise fails to drive engagement when the sponsored post occurs on Facebook. When a sponsored post occurs on Facebook, posts high in hedonic content are more effective when the advertising intent is to increase trial versus raise awareness. The effectiveness of campaign incentives depends on the platform type, such that they can increase (decrease) engagement on blogs (Facebook). The empirical evidence for these findings comes from real in-market customer response data and is supplemented with data from an experiment. Taken together, the findings highlight the critical interplay of platform type, campaign intent, source, campaign incentives, and content factors in driving engagement.",0
Energizing the Reseller's Sales Force: The Power of Brand Identification,Journal of Marketing,2010,"A manufacturer's success in the marketplace is contingent in part on its ability to energize its downstream channel members in support of its brands. Gaining the focused effort of the reseller's sales personnel is particularly important, and this has become increasingly challenging as resellers broaden their brand portfolios in the wake of industry consolidation. This study reveals a motivating influence that can potentially be harnessed by both manufacturer and channel member: identification. Using a multilevel analysis, the authors explore the sometimes conflicting impact of salesperson brand identification, salesperson organizational identification, and manufacturer?channel member control system alignment on brand and channel member sales performance. The authors also examine favorable extra-role consequences of salesperson brand identification. The results show that while organizational identification strengthens salesperson adherence to controls, brand identification can increase salesperson effort behind a specific brand, and ultimately improved brand performance, even in the face of control systems to the contrary. This suggests that suppliers can exercise influence over the reseller's sales force by strengthening the psychological connection between their brands and reseller sales personnel.",0
Selective Sensitization: Consuming a Food Activates a Goal to Consume Its Complements,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Eating a food reduces the desire to eat more of that food. General-process theories of motivation posit that eating a food also increases the motivation to eat other foods?an effect known as cross-stimulus sensitization. The authors propose that eating a food selectively sensitizes consumers to its complements rather than to all foods. Eating a food activates a goal to consume foods that consumers perceive to be well paired with the consumed food. In five experiments, imagined and actual consumption of a food sensitized participants to complementary foods but not to unrelated or semantically associated foods. These findings suggest that cross-stimulus sensitization is more specific and predictable than previously assumed. The authors identify goal activation as the process through which cross-stimulus sensitization occurs and can be instilled.",1
Prior Relationships and Consumer Responses to Service Failures: A Cross-Cultural Study,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"The authors examine the mitigating effect of an established trusting relationship between service providers and consumers on the consequences of service failures as a function of interdependent?independent self-construal. Two studies reveal that the effect of prior relationship, defined as the length of past patronage of a service provider, on consumer behavioral responses to service failure tends to be more pronounced among consumers with interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal. This variation in the mitigating effect of prior relationship can be attributed to the differential impact of trust in the service provider on the two groups of consumers. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications.",0
Deconstructing the ?First Moment of Truth?: Understanding Unplanned Consideration and Purchase Conversion Using In-Store Video Tracking,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Retailers and manufacturers are keenly interested in understanding unplanned consideration and purchase conversion, but data that capture in-store product consideration have been unavailable in the past. In the current research, the authors use in-store video tracking to collect a novel data set that records shopping behavior at the point of purchase, including product consideration. In conjunction with an entrance survey of purchase intentions, they conduct several descriptive analyses that focus on the incidence, category propensity, behavioral characteristics, and outcome of unplanned consideration. The results reveal several new empirical insights. First, the authors find significant category-level complementarities between planned items and unplanned considerations, which they capture using a latent category map. Second, planned consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence, number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g., remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to shelf, references to a shopping list). The authors conclude with a discussion of implications of these findings for research and shopper marketing.",1
The Effect of In-Store Travel Distance on Unplanned Spending: Applications to Mobile Promotion Strategies,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Typically, shoppers? paths only cover less than half of the areas in a grocery store. Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors? estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending ($21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path ($13.83). The results suggest that targeted mobile promotions aimed at increasing in-store path length can increase unplanned spending.",0
Country-of-Origin Effects on Sellers? Price Premiums in Competitive Philippine Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Data collected from highly competitive markets in the Philippines were used to investigate how country-of-origin (CO) information influenced the prices set for a wide range of products. The data permitted direct comparisons between prices for the same product produced by the same company, but in different countries, and sold in adjacent markets. Imported products produced in more industrialized countries were found to command price premiums over the same product, produced by the same company in less industrialized countries. However, imports from all countries commanded significant price premiums over domestically produced products. Consistent with previous research, branding was found to moderate the effect of CO information on price. Finally, CO information had a stronger impact on price when product risk was high than when it was low.",0
What Drives Performance in Globally Focused Marketing Organizations? A Three-Country Study,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"In marketing, compared with other organizational dimensions such as leadership, culture, structure, and processes, relatively scant attention has been devoted to the effect of strategy on firm performance, especially in the global context. Rapid globalization of markets, along with ever-increasing dynamic demands on the marketing organization, necessitates a new examination. This article reports on a study that examines the role of strategy and other organizational forces on the performance of globally focused marketing organizations headquartered in Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The general findings indicate that (1) the constructs of leadership, strategy, and culture precede the globally focused marketing organization's structure; (2) strategy precedes structure; and (3) organizational structure and processes influence marketing and financial performance. Many relationships appear to be consistent across countries, and some are uniquely tied to the home-country markets.",0
Addressing Endogeneity in International Marketing Applications of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key method in international marketing research. Users of PLS-SEM have, however, largely overlooked the issue of endogeneity, which has become an integral component of regression analysis applications. This lack of attention is surprising because the PLS-SEM method is grounded in regression analysis, for which numerous approaches for handling endogeneity have been proposed. To identify and treat endogeneity, and create awareness of how to deal with this issue, this study introduces a systematic procedure that translates control variables, instrumental variables, and Gaussian copulas into a PLS-SEM framework. We illustrate the procedure's efficacy by means of empirical data and offer recommendations to guide international marketing researchers on how to effectively address endogeneity concerns in their PLS-SEM analyses.",0
Global Organizational Learning in the Supply Chain: A Low versus High Learning Study,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"The authors examine the effects of organizational learning on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. To examine the effects of exposure to organizational learning, the authors test the hypotheses in low- versus high-learning groups in two different samples. The user sample consists of 175 users, representing the international strategic business units of one U.S.-based multinational corporation (i.e., strategic business units located outside the home country of the United States). The buyer sample consists of the corporate buyers of 200 multinational corporations, and the focus is on their supply chain activities worldwide. The authors examine the activities and relationships between (1) users and buyers (as perceived by the users) and (2) buyers and suppliers (as perceived by the buyers) in the supply chain. Overall, the results suggest that facets of organizational learning have a positive influence on customer orientation and relationship commitment in the global supply chain. In addition, attending learning seminars to increase understanding and use of organizational learning concepts appears to have a positive effect on the supply chain relationships.",0
Export Promotion Strategy and Performance: The Role of International Experience,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This study examines how international experience shapes managerial judgment in the formation of effective export promotion strategies. Drawing from contingency theory and the organizational learning perspective, the authors develop and test a model of the effects of different forms of international experience?duration, scope, and intensity?on the performance outcomes of promotion adaptation. Using data from 336 export ventures, the authors find that promotion adaptation relates positively to performance when duration is short and intensity is low, but there is a nonsignificant moderating effect for scope. However, the subsequent analysis suggests that scope, together with sociocultural distance and promotion adaptation, exerts a complex three-way effect on export performance, highlighting the need for more research attention in this area.",0
Export Product Strategy Fit and Performance: An Empirical Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"This study investigates the issue of balancing the benefits gained through standardized strategies with those achievable when adapting to local conditions. Building on previous work that has explored the role of contingency theory and the concept of strategic fit in international marketing strategy, the authors posit that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the export product strategy adaptation decision. Using a sample of Swedish exporters, they find support for the hypothesis that an array of forces from the macro-, micro-, and internal environments drives product adaptation, which affects the nature of product strategy fit and its performance outcomes. In terms of the performance relevance of product strategy fit, sociocultural environment, technological environment, marketing infrastructure, stage of product life cycle, scope of exporting experience, and duration of exporting experience all matter. However, the pattern of significant and nonsignificant findings cautions against excessive aggregation of environmental variables in conceptualizing environment?product strategy fit to performance linkages. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications of the findings for theory building and management practice.",0
Megamarketing: The Creation of Markets as a Social Process,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Drawing from institutional theory in sociology, this article theorizes the process of ?megamarketing??defined by Kotler (1986) as the use of strategic efforts by a firm or firms to gain the cooperation of multiple stakeholders?to understand how new industries are created and sustained in a complex social and political context. The author uses an analysis of the casino gambling industry to demonstrate the role of normative and regulatory structures in facilitating the adoption and eventual acceptance of an industry through the social process of legitimation. In a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 7211 newspaper articles from 1980 to 2007, the author finds that frames such as crime, business, and regulation change over time and that these frames are used by multiple stakeholders to structure normative conceptions about the practice of casino gambling. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of market creation and development over time and provide marketing managers with the conceptual tools for megamarketing in any industry.",0
Status Games: Market Driving through Social Influence in the U.S. Wine Industry,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Research on market orientation finds that market-driven firms succeed by identifying and appealing to consumer needs. Yet many technologically innovative firms achieve remarkable success by taking a market-driving approach. The ways that firms drive markets without disruptive innovation, however, remain unclear. Adopting a market-systems perspective, the authors conduct an ethnographic analysis of producers, distributors, retailers, critics, and consumers in the U.S. wine market. They find that firms drive the market by playing a status game. Firms pursue a vision and advance that vision among influencers inside and outside the industry to gain recognition. Winners of the status game influence and drive social consensus by setting benchmarks and shaping consumer preferences to the firm's advantage. High status is difficult to imitate, creating an advantage that can endure for years or decades.",0
Construal Matching in Online Search: Applying Text Analysis to Illuminate the Consumer Decision Journey,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"As consumers move through their decision journey, they adopt different goals (e.g., transactional vs. informational). In this research, the authors propose that consumer goals can be detected through textual analysis of online search queries and that both marketers and consumers can benefit when paid search results and advertisements match consumer search?related goals. In bridging construal level theory and textual analysis, the authors show that consumers at different stages of the decision journey tend to assume different levels of mental construal, or mindsets (i.e., abstract vs. concrete). They find evidence of a fluency-driven matching effect in online search such that when consumer mindsets are more abstract (more concrete), consumers generate textual search queries that use more abstract (more concrete) language. Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress. Six empirical studies, including a pilot study, a survey, three lab experiments, and a field experiment involving over 128,000 ad impressions provide support for this construal matching effect in online search.",1
Differences in Perspective and the Influence of Charitable Appeals: When Imagining Oneself as the Victim is not Beneficial,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Advertisements often stimulate consumers to imagine themselves in a situation in which they would personally benefit from using the product being advertised. However, when an advertisement is intended to induce consumers to benefit someone else (e.g., to donate money for relief of disaster victims), stimulating them to imagine themselves in the situation confronting the beneficiary can sometimes conflict with the image they form of themselves as a potential helper. This conflict in imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness. Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help, characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the amount of money they donated. However, when they had an a priori disposition to take the perspective of a potential donor at the time they read the appeal, these same characteristics decreased the appeal's effectiveness.",1
Shaping Consumer Imaginations: The Role of Self-Focused Attention in Product Evaluations,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Consumers? attraction to a product can often be based on the subjective reactions that they imagine they would have if they personally used it. Three experiments examine the effects of self-focused attention on the use of this criterion and the conditions in which it is applied. When features of the judgment (social or nonsocial) context are similar to those of the situation in which the products are normally used, self-focused attention increases participants? disposition to imagine themselves using the products they evaluate, and in turn, these imaginings increase both their evaluations of these products and their likelihood of choosing these products as a gift for taking part in the experiment. The effects occur when features of the judgment context are manipulated both by incidental background music and by the presence of others in the situation at hand. However, when either self-focused attention is low or features of the judgment context are dissimilar to those in which the products are normally used, these effects are not apparent.",1
Making Sales Technology Effective,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Firms invest billions of dollars in sales technologies (STs; e.g., customer relationship management, sales automation tools) to improve sales force effectiveness and efficiency. However, the results expected from ST investments are often not achieved. This article proposes relationship-forging tasks that are critical to the link between ST use and key aspects of salesperson performance (i.e., a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers and administrative performance). The authors evaluate relationship-forging tasks in the context of a model that considers the antecedents and consequences of three different uses of ST: accessing, analyzing, and communicating information. In general, the results of a field study, which is analyzed using block-recursive structural equation modeling, support the relationship-forging theory and show that relationship-forging tasks predict 57% of the variance in a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. The findings also support hypotheses that using ST either to analyze or to communicate information has mediated positive effects on a salesperson's relationship-building performance with customers. However, a salesperson's use of ST to analyze information has negative influences on administrative performance, creating an unexpected trade-off for sales and marketing managers.",0
"Heuristics and Biases in Data-Based Decision Making: Effects of Experience, Training, and Graphical Data Displays",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Managers use numerical data as the basis for many decisions. This research investigates how data on prior advertising expenditures and sales outcomes are used in budget allocation decisions and attempts to answer three important questions about data-based inferences. First, do biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall, exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme allocations. Trend-based heuristics were used the least.",1
Internationalization Motives and Facilitating Factors: Qualitative Evidence from Smaller Specialist Retailers,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Drawing on case study evidence, this article explores the reasons small specialist retailers internationalize and the facilitating factors that help them overcome the obstacles to internationalization. The authors employ qualitative research techniques and, to build theory from an unexplored area of research, adopt a multiple-case approach. The findings suggest that though a strong company brand identity is the most significant motive for expansion, other internal and external factors facilitate the international decision-making process.",0
Clicks as a Healthy Alternative to Bricks: How Online Grocery Shopping Reduces Vice Purchases,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Although consumers are concerned about their health, obesity statistics suggest that contextual factors often lead them to choose unhealthy alternatives (i.e., vices) rather than healthy ones (i.e., virtues). Noting the increasing prevalence of online grocery shopping, the authors focus on shopping channels as one such contextual factor and investigate how food choices made online differ from food choices made in a traditional brick-and-mortar store. A database study and three lab experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers' desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to purchase fewer vices. These findings highlight several unexplored differences between online and offline shopping, with important implications for consumers, public policy makers, and retailers.",1
A Comparative Study on Parameter Recovery of Three Approaches to Structural Equation Modeling,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Traditionally, two approaches have been employed for structural equation modeling: covariance structure analysis and partial least squares. A third alternative, generalized structured component analysis, was introduced recently in the psychometric literature. The authors conduct a simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of these three approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification. In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured.",1
Why Unhappy Customers Are Unlikely to Share Their Opinions with Brands,Journal of Marketing,2020,"For brands to thrive, they must understand consumer sentiment; if consumers? likelihood of sharing their opinion is a function of their attitude toward a brand, then brands? perception of consumer sentiment may be systematically biased. While research in consumer-to-consumer sharing (i.e., word of mouth) suggests that those with extreme attitude are more likely to share than those with neutral attitude (a U-shaped relationship), the relationship between consumers? attitude toward a brand and their propensity to share with a brand is unknown. In contrast to the U-shaped pattern observed in word of mouth, the authors find a hockey stick?shaped relationship between attitude and sharing with brands (?__/?). Those with positive attitude (vs. neutral attitude) are more likely to share their opinion, but those with negative attitude do not show a similar increase in sharing. The authors show that this pattern emerges because, among consumers with positive (vs. neutral) attitude toward a brand, reciprocity norms drive increased sharing, but among consumers with negative (vs. neutral) attitude, competing mechanisms drive behavior: the desire to vent increases sharing, but at the same time an aversion to criticize others directly deters sharing. The authors test these ideas using a series of studies, including a field study.",0
Should Your Brand Pick a Side? How Market Share Determines the Impact of Corporate Political Advocacy,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Consumers increasingly expect brands to ?pick a side? on divisive sociopolitical issues, but managers are reluctant to risk alienating customers who oppose their position. Moreover, research on identity-based consumption and negativity bias suggests that corporate political advocacy (CPA) is more likely to repel existing customers who oppose the CPA than to attract new customers who support it, implying that the net effect will be negative even if consumers overall are evenly divided in their support/opposition. In this research, the authors posit that despite this negativity bias in individual-level choice, the net effect of CPA at the market level is determined by a sorting process that benefits small-share brands and hurts large-share brands. This is because having few customers to lose and many to gain can offset the risk of the negativity bias in consumers? identity-driven responses to CPA, potentially leading to a net influx of customers for small-share brands. Five experiments provide support for this theorizing and identify authenticity as a necessary condition for small share brands to benefit.",1
Determinants of Korean and Japanese New Product Performance: An Interrelational and Process View,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Firms in South Korea and Japan are designing and introducing new products to global markets, contributing to their strong export-led economic growth. To better understand how Korean and Japanese firms are succeeding, the authors conducted a study on new product development. They surveyed product developers in both countries about how strategic, organizational, and process factors influence new product performance (NPP). The authors learned that the determinants of NPP are interrelated and that the new product development process itself is central, namely the stages of initiation and implementation. These two stages directly determine NPP, though initiation appears to be more important. The stages are strengthened by factors such as customer orientation, cross-functional integration, and new product team proficiency; however, the effects are not uniform. Although the model and hypotheses are largely supported, indicating that, in general, they describe South Korean and Japanese new product development, the authors found a few differences between the countries.",0
"Market Orientation, Creativity, and New Product Performance in High-Technology Firms",Journal of Marketing,2004,"The ability to generate and market creative ideas in new products (NPs) and related marketing programs (MPs) in response to changing market needs is key to the success of a firm. This research examines the mediating role of NP and MP creativity between market orientation and NP success. The authors investigate (1) whether market orientation facilitates or inhibits creativity, (2) whether creativity influences NP performance, and (3) how to define and measure creativity in the NP development and launch contexts. They use a two-stage sampling frame to collect 312 sets of responses from managers and NP team leaders and thereby address the potential for common method bias in measures of creativity and NP performance. The findings indicate that NP and MP creativity mediates the relationship between market orientation and NP success. The authors also show that the meaningfulness dimension, rather than the novelty dimension, of creativity is of greater importance in explaining the link between market orientation and NP success. The empirical results provide significant theoretical and managerial implications for NP strategy.",0
A Dynamic Choice Map Approach to Modeling Attribute-Level Varied Behavior among Stockkeeping Units,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Because product development decisions are often made at the attribute level, brand managers need to understand the attribute-level competitive structure. At the same time, consumers may exhibit reinforcing behavior (i.e., high repeating) on some attributes and derived varied behavior (i.e., high switching) on other attributes. This calls for the extension of current stockkeeping unit choice models to consider attribute-level feedback effects. The authors develop such a model using an internal market structure analysis approach. This provides the benefit of attribute-level competitive maps and estimates of attribute-level reinforcing behavior versus derived varied behavior. The authors estimate the model in the pourable salad dressing category. The fit is better than current models of stockkeeping unit choice, both in the estimation sample and in the validation sample. The authors discuss implications for researchers and practitioners.",1
The Roles of Channel-Category Associations and Geodemographics in Channel Patronage,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Consumers purchase goods from various channels or retail formats, such as grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and convenience stores. To identify the most appropriate channels and to allocate the distribution of products among channels efficiently, managers need a better understanding of consumer behavior with respect to these channels. The authors examine the moderating role of channel-category associations in consumer channel patronage by extending the literature on brand associations to the context of channels, and they estimate a model that links channel-category associations with consumer geodemographics and channel share of volume. The authors first identify the product categories associated with particular channels through a correspondence analysis of a field-intercept survey. They then use the channel-category associations and geodemographic factors to estimate their direct and interactive effects on channel share of volume. The channel-category associations have significant main effects and interaction effects with channel type and geodemographic factors on channel share of volume, and they account for the majority of the explained variance (72%) in channel share of volume. Overall, the findings provide several conceptual and managerial insights into consumer channel perceptions and patronage behavior.",0
"The Interplay among Category Characteristics, Customer Characteristics, and Customer Activities on in-Store Decision Making",Journal of Marketing,2009,"The authors explore product category and customer characteristics that affect consumers? likelihood of engaging in unplanned purchases. In addition, they examine consumer activities that can exacerbate or limit these effects. The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46%, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93%. The results support the predictions that list use, more frequent trips, limiting the aisles visited, limiting time spent in the store, and paying by cash are effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of making unplanned purchases.",0
When Consumption Regulations Backfire: The Role of Political Ideology,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors investigate the role of political ideology in consumer reactions to consumption regulations. First, they demonstrate via a natural experiment that conservatives (but not liberals) increase usage of mobile phones in cars after a law was enacted prohibiting that activity (Study 1). Then, through three lab experiments the authors illustrate that after consumers are exposed to consumption regulations from the government (e.g., laws that restrict consumption, warning labels designed by the Food and Drug Administration), conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to (1) use phones when restricted (Study 2), (2) purchase unhealthy foods (Study 3), and (3) view smoking e-cigarettes more favorably (Study 4). No such effects are observed when a nongovernment source is used, or when the message from the government is framed as a notification (vs. warning). These findings point to the important roles of political ideology and the message source in increasing reactance to consumption regulations, thereby mitigating the effectiveness of public policy initiatives undertaken by the government.",1
Misleading Heuristics and Moderated Multiple Regression Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Moderated multiple regression models allow the simple relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable to depend on the level of another independent variable. The moderated relationship, often referred to as the interaction, is modeled by including a product term as an additional independent variable. Moderated relationships are central to marketing (e.g., Does the effect of promotion on sales depend on the market segment?). Multiple regression models not including a product term are widely used and well understood. The authors argue that researchers have derived from this simpler type of multiple regression several data analysis heuristics that, when inappropriately generalized to moderated multiple regression, can result in faulty interpretations of model coefficients and incorrect statistical analyses. Using theoretical arguments and constructed data sets, the authors describe these heuristics, discuss how they may easily be misapplied, and suggest some good practices for estimating, testing, and interpreting regression models that include moderated relationships.",1
Ethical Decisions and Response Mode Compatibility: Weighting of Ethical Attributes in Consideration Sets Formed by excluding versus Including Product Alternatives,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Across four studies, including one involving an actual monetary decision, the authors demonstrate that forming a product consideration set by excluding versus including alternatives induces consumers to place more weight on ethical attributes, such as company labor practices and animal testing. This nonnormative difference reflects a compatibility between exclusion and ethics, and it holds regardless of attribute framing or consumer emotion. The authors also find that consumers judge others? behavior more negatively for excluding ethical products than for including ethical products. These results have implications for the marketing of ethical products, both specifically (e.g., it is important to encourage exclusion modes) and generally (e.g., the failure to consider ethical products may reflect seemingly minor contextual issues guiding the decision process and not consumer disinterest in ethical issues).",1
Is Top 10 Better than Top 9? The Role of Expectations in Consumer Response to Imprecise Rank Claims,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Many marketing communications are carefully designed to cast a brand in its most favorable light. For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand's exact rank. The authors propose that when marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10) can influence consumers? evaluations and willingness to pay. Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.",1
A Model of Consumer Learning for Service Quality and Usage,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"In many services (e.g., the wireless service industry), consumers choose a service plan according to their expected consumption. In such situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they may be uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV). They find that consumer learning can result in a win?win situation for both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall CLV with consumer learning than without. The key driver of this result is the change in the retention rate with and without learning.",1
A Conjoint Approach to Multipart Pricing,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Multipart pricing is commonly used by service providers such as car rentals, prescription drug plans, health maintenance organizations, and wireless telephony. The general structure of these pricing schemes is a fixed access fee, which sometimes entitles users to a certain level of product use; a variable fee for additional use; and still another fee for add-on features that are priced individually and/or as bundles. The authors propose a method using conjoint analysis for multipart pricing. The method reflects the two-way dependence between prices and consumption and incorporates consumers' uncertainty about their use of a service. The proposed method estimates both choice probabilities and usage levels for each consumer as functions of the product features and the different price components. The authors then use these estimates to evaluate the expected revenues and profits of alternative plans and pricing schemes. They illustrate this method using data from a conjoint study of cell phone services. They compare the results with those obtained from using several competing models. Finally, they use the proposed procedure to identify the optimal set of features in a base plan and the pricing of optional features for a provider of cell phone services.",1
A Bargaining Theory of Distribution Channels,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"A critical factor in channel relationships between manufacturers and retailers is the relative bargaining power of both parties. In this article, the authors develop a framework to examine bargaining between channel members and demonstrate that the bargaining process actually affects the degree of coordination and that two-part tariffs will not be part of the market contract even in a simple one manufacturer-one retailer channel. To establish the institutional and theoretical bases for these results, the authors relax the conventional assumption that the product being exchanged is completely specifiable in a contract. They show that the institution of bargaining has force, and it affects channel coordination when the complexity of nonspecifiability of the product exchange is present. The authors find that greater retailer power promotes channel coordination. Thus, there are conditions in which the presence of a powerful retailer might actually be beneficial to all channel members. The authors recover the standard double-marginalization take-it-or-leave-it offer outcome as a particular case of the bargaining process. They also examine the implications of relative bargaining powers for whether the product is delivered ?early? (i.e., before demand is realized) or ?late? (i.e., delivered to the retailer only if there is demand). The authors present the implications for returns policies as well as of renegotiation costs and retail competition.",1
Ethnic Entrepreneurial and Marketing Systems: Implications for the Global Economy,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"The role of immigrant ethnic entrepreneurs in the small business milieu of the developed world has been studied within sociology for the past three decades. This article attempts to generate interest in the study of ethnic entrepreneurs within marketing and international business, especially noting the distinct business and marketing systemic features of ethnic entrepreneurial networks. Using prior literature and the findings from a qualitative study, the authors build some elements of a theory of ethnic business systems and demonstrate aspects on which such systems differ from other business firms and networks, especially in the United States. The authors argue that ethnic enterprises make tremendous contributions to local and international economies while bridging small business, globalization, and the nation-state in interesting ways.",0
An Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of Price-Matching Refund Policies,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Price-matching refund policies, or offers by firms to match competitor's prices, are common in both consumer and industrial marketing. Much of the previous theoretical work in economics suggests that price-matching refunds are associated with higher prices. In contrast, the trade press postulates that price-matching policies are associated with lower prices. Given these inconsistent views regarding price-matching policies, the authors experimentally examine how consumers view and interpret such policies and then develop a model that incorporates these consumer interpretations as well as asymmetries across stores. In the model, the asymmetry across stores is the key to deriving the conditions under which a signaling equilibrium exists in the presence of price-matching policies. The critical point is that the competition-reducing and price discrimination effects, which seem to form the basis of most of the previous theoretical literature, can be counteracted by the presence of differentiated firms and uninformed consumers. The model suggests that under some conditions, price-matching policies can lead to more intense price competition. Furthermore, all firms will not find it profitable to offer refunds, and consistent with consumer expectations, the firms with lower prices will offer refunds.",1
Problems in International Protection of Intellectual Property Rights,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Intellectual property rights are policies that assign and protect the rights to earn income from innovative and creative activity. These rights provide legal authority to control the dissemination and commercialization of new information and ideas and to enforce sanctions against their unauthorized use. Intellectual property rights play a critical role in global economic growth and development because they affect the profitability of industrial research and the rewards to creative activity. At the same time, intellectual property rights are controversial because their stronger international protection may come at the expense of higher prices and reduced availability of products, particularly in developing countries. Obviously, developing countries prefer a low level of protection.Traditionally, intellectual property rights were of concern only to a few lawyers specializing in the field. But the enormous expansion in world trade in the 1980s elevated intellectual property rights to new prominence in international trade policy. At the same time, new and emerging technologies have made traditional protection of intellectual property rights inadequate. For these reasons, the topic of international protection of intellectual property rights should be an important subject of concern among international business and marketing scholars.This article provides an overview of intellectual property rights and their international protection. The conflict between the industrialized and developing countries on the level of protection is highlighted. Issues and controversies that affect the field today are examined. Finally, ideas are advanced for further research on the subject.",0
The Influence of Consumers? Lay Theories on Approach/Avoidance Motivation,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This research suggests that consumers? approach/avoidance tendencies depend on their implicit theories about the world around them. Entity theorists believe in the immutability of the world, and thus they are not influenced by whether a persuasive message is framed in terms of approach or avoidance. In contrast, incremental theorists believe that the world is mutable, and thus they are influenced by the message frame. This proposition is supported in two studies that feature advertising messages. The mechanism underlying these effects differs as a function of implicit theory orientation. Entity theorists? focus on the outcome and incremental theorists? reliance on the process form the basis for the observed findings. A third study reveals that when a consumer's implicit theory is violated, these findings are reversed. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications.",1
Valenced Comparisons,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"In this article, the authors show empirically that comparative advertisements can vary in terms of their valence, that is, whether respondents perceive them as positive (less derogatory) or negative (more derogatory) in their references to competition. In addition, the authors report findings from three studies that demonstrate that advertisements perceived as carrying more negative/derogatory references to competition result in more counterarguments, fewer support arguments, lower believability more associated perceived bias, and lower brand attitude scores than do advertisements perceived as more positive/nonderogatory in their competitive references. Tests of mediation suggest that the effectiveness of valenced comparisons is mediated by advertiser attributions that are more negative for negative comparisons. The authors discuss implications for designing more effective comparative advertisements.",1
Having Control Over and Above Situations: The Influence of Elevated Viewpoints on Risk Taking,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article examines how consumers? exposure to the viewpoint of high versus low vertical position changes their risk-taking behavior. The author proposes that consumers? views of scenery from a high physical elevation induce an illusory sense of control, which in turn intensifies risk taking. Multiple studies show that exposure to the viewpoint of high vertical positions increases risk taking in both laboratory settings (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and real settings (Study 4). In addition, the author demonstrates that an illusory sense of control mediates the effect of an elevated viewpoint on risk taking (Study 2) and that the effect of elevation on risk taking is attenuated when people use a low-level mental construal to process visual information (Study 3).",1
The Psychology of Decisions to Abandon Waits for Service,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research investigates the process that underlies consumer decisions to abandon waits for service. The work centers on a hypothesis that stay-or-renege decisions reflect a process that blends two opposing psychic forces: escalating displeasure with waiting versus an escalating commitment to a wait that has been initiated. The consequence is a predicted tendency that abandonments are most likely near the midpoint of waits, which is suboptimal for many waiting time distributions. This study tests the hypothesis using data from three laboratory experiments in which participants play a time-management game that involves waiting for downloads from different computer servers, as well as field data about hang-ups in an emergency call center in India. The data lend support to the proposed competing hazards model and show that the trade-off between desires to abandon and persist is moderated by contextual factors, such as the initial number of alternative queues and the amount of distracting activity engaged in during a wait.",1
The Effect of a Data Breach Announcement on Customer Behavior: Evidence from a Multichannel Retailer,Journal of Marketing,2018,"In this study, the authors assess the effects of a data breach announcement (DBA) by a multichannel retailer on customer behavior. They exploit a natural experiment and use individual customer transaction data from the retailer to conduct a detailed and systematic empirical examination of the effects of a DBA on customer spending and channel migration behavior. To identify the effects, the authors compare the change in customer behavior before and after the DBA between a treatment group (customers whose information is breached) and a control group (customers whose information is not breached) using the difference-in-differences modeling framework. They find that although the data breach results in a significant decrease in customer spending, customers of the firm migrate from the breached to the unbreached channels of the retailer. The findings further reflect that customers with a higher retailer patronage are more forgiving because the negative effects of the DBA are lower for customers with a higher level of patronage. The authors propose and empirically test for the role of customer data vulnerability as the behavioral mechanism that drives customer behavior subsequent to a DBA. The authors offer prescriptions for managers on how to engage with customers following DBAs.",0
Perception Spillovers across Competing Brands: A Disaggregate Model of how and When,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Drawing on the accessibility?diagnosticity framework and previous literature on branding and order of entry, the authors hypothesize that perception spillovers can also occur across directly competing products that do not share a common brand name. The authors suggest two mechanisms (prior perception spillover and dynamic perception spillover) and one moderating variable (product/brand similarity). To test for spillovers across competing brands, the authors develop a structural Bayesian learning model and estimate it using prescription choice and marketing communication data from a panel of physicians. From their model results, the authors find evidence of prior and dynamic perception spillovers across competing brands only when brands are sufficiently similar. In contrast, they find no evidence of spillover effects across brands that are highly dissimilar. Finally, several policy experiments illustrate the strength and significance of competitive spillovers for product diffusion, and from the results, the authors derive strategic implications for order-of-entry effects and the entry of ?me-too? products.",1
Studying Heterogeneity in the Subsistence Consumer Market: A Context-Sensitive Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"This multimethod study develops a context-sensitive approach to subsistence consumer segmentation as advocated in the international market segmentation literature. Building on the theory of consumption values, the authors conduct multisited rapid ethnography research to collect primary data from urban subsistence consumers in South Africa and India who were presented with a simulated product choice situation. The authors convert the data into quantifiable segmentation variables for further analysis. This approach is particularly useful in subsistence consumer markets that are characterized by a dearth of quantifiable consumer data. The study reveals four distinct subsegments?Family-Oriented Workers, Low-Skilled Price-Sensitives, Young Performers, and Conscious Conservatives?that differ significantly in education level, number of children, age, consumption values, and purchase behavior. A detailed discussion of the context-sensitive segmentation approach applied in this study enables scholars and practitioners to deploy and adapt it to different environments and requirements.",0
"Transfer-Appropriate Processing, Response Fluency, and the Mere Measurement Effect",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The mere measurement of a person's intention to behave has been shown to influence his or her likelihood of engaging in the behavior. The mere measurement effect has been attributed to an increased accessibility of the attitude toward the behavior. Another source of the mere measurement effect may be the redundancy in the cognitive processes used to generate the mere measurement response and the cognitive processes used to decide whether to engage in the behavior. Process redundancy creates a fluency that can be interpreted as supportive of the behavioral tendency. Across eight studies, the authors show that processing fluency also contributes to the mere measurement effect.",1
A Connectionist Model of Brand?Quality Associations,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Consumers use brand names and product features to predict the performance of products. Various learning models offer hypotheses about the source of these predictive associations. Spreading-activation models hypothesize that cues acquire predictive value as a consequence of being present during the acquisition of product performance information. Least mean squares connectionist models hypothesize that any one cue acquires predictive value only to the extent that it can predict differences in performance that are not already predicted by other available cues. Five studies in the context of portfolio-branding strategies provide evidence supporting a least mean squares connectionist model. As predicted by this model, results show that subbranding and ingredient-branding strategies can protect brands from dilution in some situations but can promote dilution in other situations.",1
?Pie Sharing? in Complex Collaboration Contexts,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of collaborative relationships between organizations. Much attention has been given to how organizations ?expand the pie? of benefits between them; however, there is little that addresses the ensuing issue: how organizations divide the expanded pie. The author examines the relational impact of pie sharing in complex collaboration contexts marked by uncertainty in resources and output, information asymmetries, intangible aspects, and noncomparable factors and processes. The author develops a conceptual framework that examines how the use of equity and equality sharing principles in conjunction with various resource and organizational conditions can be used to affect relational outcomes systematically. Survey results of 300 research and development managers, scientists, and engineers indicate that sharing principles can have a positive or negative effect on the relationship depending on the type of sharing principle used and the characteristics of the resources and organizations. In particular, sharing processes should be responsive to the goals of the collaboration. The results underscore the strategic nature of the sharing phenomenon as well as the importance of relational concerns in complex and uncertain interorganizational settings.",1
An Exploratory Study of the Introduction of Online Reverse Auctions,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Buyers are increasingly turning to online reverse auctions in their negotiations with suppliers. How do these price competition mechanisms affect buyer?supplier relationships? The author considers this question in the context of a quasi experiment involving six online reverse auctions conducted in the supply base of a major industrial buyer. The results indicate that these auctions increase both new and current suppliers? beliefs that buyers act opportunistically, particularly in open-bid auctions. Current suppliers are generally more willing than new suppliers to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Paradoxically, in sealed-bid auctions, both current and new suppliers increase their willingness to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Although these auctions can yield cost savings, the savings are category specific and are not systematically related to an open- or sealed-bid format. The author also discusses implications for the use of online reverse auctions in industrial sourcing activities.",0
The Impact of Online Reverse Auction Design on Buyer?Supplier Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2007,"As the use of online reverse auctions in industrial-sourcing activities grows, buyers and suppliers are increasingly concerned about these auctions? effects on their interorganizational performance (i.e., suspicions of opportunism, overall satisfaction, and future expectations). This research examines how the buyer's auction design (i.e., the number of bidders, the economic stakes, and price visibility) and the price dynamics over the course of the auction affect its relationship with suppliers. Analysis of 25 quasi experiments involving 125 suppliers and $385 million in procurement contracts suggests that the larger the number of bidders, the larger the economic stakes, and the less visible the price in an auction, the more positive is the impact on the interorganizational relationship. Large price drops (higher savings) over the course of the event have a detrimental effect on the buyer?supplier relationship. For auctions in which the lowest bidder wins, there is a decrease in opportunism suspicions as the economic stakes of the auction increase, and there is an increase in opportunism suspicions in auctions with greater price visibility. Implications for the management of industrial procurement activities are considered.",0
Control Mechanisms and the Relationship Life Cycle: Implications for Safeguarding Specific Investments and Developing Commitment,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Powerful suppliers often require retailers to make significant idiosyncratic investments to improve coordination between organizations and to enhance the supplier's presence in the end market. The authors examine how a retailer might better manage the hold-up potential of these transaction-specific investments (TSIs) through the use of three control mechanisms: supplier's TSIs, the development of relational norms, and the use of explicit contracts. Moreover, the authors consider the time-dependent nature of these mechanisms by observing their effects on commitment over the course of a relationship life cycle. The results indicate that (1) a retailer's TSIs have a negative effect on its perceptions of supplier commitment; (2) a supplier's TSIs and relational norms increase the retailer's perception of supplier commitment, whereas explicit contracts are associated with perceptions of lower supplier commitment; and (3) each of the three control mechanisms moderates the negative impact of retailer investments on perceptions of supplier commitment contingent on the relationship phase. Specifically, bilateral TSIs enhance commitment in the exploration phase and a positive effect during the decline phase. The results also indicate that the retailer's perceptions of supplier commitment are positively related to its evaluation of supplier performance and satisfaction and negatively related to conflict.",1
Interorganizational Relationships and Bidding Behavior in Industrial Online Reverse Auctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors model (1) the impact of the supplier's relationship propensity before the auction on the supplier's bidding aggressiveness in the auction (in terms of the number of bids it submits, the rate at which the bids are submitted, and the price concessions offered) and (2) the impact of bidding behaviors in the auction on the buyer?supplier relationship after auction through longitudinal survey data from 12 online reverse auctions across various product categories. The results suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition. Collectively, the results suggest that pricing and relationships are intertwined and traded off against each other in complex ways and that the auction does not operate in isolation of key organizational variables.",1
Low-Stakes Opportunism,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"In this research, the authors develop a theory addressing why people act opportunistically when the stakes (i.e., payoffs) are low. Transaction cost theory suggests that opportunistic behavior is more likely under high-stakes conditions. The authors identify rapport as an important moderator of this relationship. Through a series of three studies, they find that high-stakes opportunism appears to occur only when rapport is low. In contrast, when rapport is high, this relationship reverses, such that opportunism is actually more likely when the stakes are low than when they are high. The authors attribute these findings to differences in reasoning and find that when rapport is high and the stakes are low, people are better able to justify their actions by employing morally malleable reasoning. Thus, this research offers insights into an important form of opportunism that has been largely absent from transaction cost theory.",1
Generating Sales While Providing Service: A Study of Customer Service Representatives' Ambidextrous Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Cross- and up-selling in inbound call centers is a growing business practice, with the promise of enhanced revenue generation and customer retention. Yet firms struggle to create conditions that are conducive to customer service representatives' (CSRs') concurrent engagement in service and sales. By developing a framework of the antecedents and performance consequences of aligned sales and customer service provision, this study advances understanding of ambidexterity at the employee level. The framework receives strong support from an empirical study based on CSRs' survey responses and matched performance data. A CSR's locomotion orientation facilitates ambidextrous behavior and interacts positively with an assessment orientation. However, team identification and bounded discretion impair this valuable interplay. Ambidextrous behavior also increases customer satisfaction and sales performance but decreases efficiency. Nevertheless, the overall performance effect is positive.",0
On Managerial Relevance,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The concept of managerial relevance continues to be a significant topic for both research faculty and business schools alike. Despite decades of debate, it is surprising that there is virtually no work on the nature of the concept itself. Thus, the author defines the concept of managerial relevance, makes three specific observations, and discusses research implications for each observation. The key message is that the field needs a much deeper understanding of the marketing roles within the firm, and research programs must be crafted to fit the needs of these particular roles. The author calls this approach ?role-relevant? managerial research. With this central thesis in mind, he examines the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) as an illustrative case study to identify areas of inquiry that are both novel and highly managerially relevant. This analysis reveals that of the seven core tasks of the CMO, three have been lightly investigated. The author concludes with advice to both academics and practitioners on how to increase the role relevance of academic research.",0
Brand Licensing: What Drives Royalty Rates?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"In brand licensing, the brand owner (the licensor) grants another firm (the licensee) the right to use the brand. This differs from franchising, in which a contractual arrangement between a franchisor and a franchisee exists to run a business based on the franchisor's business model. Brand licensing helps generate revenues and protect the brand from misappropriation. In such contractual arrangements, agency theory suggests that when parties to the contract engage in moral hazard (i.e., opportunistic behavior), suboptimal outcomes may result. The authors examine how concerns of moral hazard affect royalty rate, a popular form of compensation in brand licensing. From an agency theory perspective, they discuss how market and contract characteristics influence the risk of moral hazard and shape royalty rates in international brand licensing. The results obtained using data from international licensing contracts indicate that a country's intellectual property rights protection enables licensees to benefit from lower royalty rates and market size enables licensors to demand higher royalty rates. The authors also examine impact of other contract characteristics, such as contract duration and exclusivity, on royalty rate. The results imply that concerns of opportunistic behavior on the part of both the licensor and the licensee influence royalty rates.",0
The Role of Relational Information Processes and Technology Use in Customer Relationship Management,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Drawing on the relationship marketing and market information processing literature streams, the authors conceptualize and measure relational information processes, or organizational routines that are critical for customer relationship management (CRM). The authors examine the key drivers and outcome of relational information processes and the role of technology in implementing CRM using data collected from a diverse sample of firms. The results show that relational information processes play a vital role in enhancing an organization's customer relationship performance. By moderating the influence of relational information processes on customer relationship performance, technology used for CRM performs an important and supportive role. The study provides insights into why the use of CRM technology might not always deliver the expected customer relationship performance outcome.",0
Drivers and Performance Outcomes of Relationship Learning for Suppliers in Cross-Border Customer?Supplier Relationships: The Role of Communication Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Recently, relationship learning between supply chain members has drawn a great deal of attention in the literature. In the context of the international electronics supply chain, which is characterized by cultural differences and complexity of products, relationship learning is difficult to achieve and relies largely on close collaboration between partners. The authors build on the resource-based view of the firm and adopt a communication culture theory to examine drivers and performance outcomes of relationship learning in cross-border relationships in the electronics industry. They propose a research framework in which a firm's innovativeness orientation, trust, information technology advancement, and technological uncertainty are determinants of relationship learning. In the framework, they introduce the communication cultures of the supplier and buyer as a moderator. Using 246 electronics suppliers in relationships with international original equipment manufacturer customers, the authors empirically show that innovativeness orientation, trust, and technological uncertainty affect relationship learning positively. Furthermore, the communication cultures of the supplier and buyer moderate the effects of innovativeness orientation and technological uncertainty. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications.",0
Probabilistic Subset-Conjunctive Models for Heterogeneous Consumers,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors propose two generalizations of conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. First, they relax the requirement that an acceptable alternative must be satisfactory on one criterion (disjunctive) or on all criteria (conjunctive). Second, they relax the assumption that consumers make deterministic judgments when evaluating alternatives. They combine the two generalizations into a probabilistic subset-conjunctive rule, which allows consumers to use any number or subset of decision criteria when screening alternatives and permits them to be uncertain about the acceptability of attribute levels. These two features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules currently described in the literature. The authors describe a latent-class method for the estimation of the subset-conjunctive rules and the attribute-level consideration probabilities using either consideration or choice data. Applications using both types of data suggest that the proposed models predict as well as linear models do; can make different predictions of consideration, choice, and market shares; and provide insights into consumer decision processes that are different from those obtained with linear models.",1
The Importance of Modeling Temporal Dependence of Timing and Quantity in Direct Marketing,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The analysis of customer value in direct marketing typically combines customer timing and quantity data into a single statistic that is used to compute lifetime values, rank-order customers for differential action, and identify prospects for cross-selling. However, current models assume that purchase timing and quantity decisions are independently realized (i.e., uncorrelated) over time given individual-level parameters. In this article, the authors show that customer value calculations can be severely biased in these models when timing and quantity are dependently related. The authors propose alternative models that lead to substantial gains in profitability in two direct-marketing data sets. The results indicate that the commonly held assumption of independence leads to an overvaluation of customer value.",1
"Multiperiod Contracting and Salesperson Effort Profiles: The Optimality of ?Hockey Stick,? ?Giving Up,? and ?Resting on Laurels?",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors study multiperiod sales force incentive contracting in which salespeople can engage in effort gaming, a phenomenon that has extensive empirical support. Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, the authors conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. The authors show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being suboptimal, such as postponing effort exertion (?hockey stick?) and not exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome (?giving up? and ?resting on laurels,? respectively) may indeed be induced optimally by the firm. This is because, under certain conditions that depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate rewards on extreme demand outcomes. Doing this induces gaming and reduces expected demand but also makes motivating effort cheaper, thus saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods, this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, ?hockey stick,? ?giving up,? and ?resting on laurels? can be optimal for the firm even under repeated short time horizon contracting. The results imply that one must carefully consider the setting and environmental factors when making inferences about contract effectiveness from dynamic effort profiles of agents.",1
Consumer Click Behavior at a Search Engine: The Role of Keyword Popularity,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors study consumers? click behavior on organic and sponsored links after a keyword search on an Internet search engine. Using a data set of individual-level click activity after keyword searches from a leading search engine in Korea, the authors find that consumers? click activity after a keyword search is low and heavily concentrated on the organic list. However, searches of less popular keywords (i.e., keywords with lower search volume) are associated with more clicks per search and a larger fraction of sponsored clicks. This indicates that, compared with more popular keywords, consumers who search for less popular keywords expend more effort in their search for information and are closer to a purchase, which makes them more targetable for sponsored search advertising.",1
"EXPRESS: Consumer Rational (In)Attention to Favorable and Unfavorable Product Information, and Firm Information Design",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"We study how a consumer optimally allocates attention to favorable and unfavorable information related to a product before purchasing it, when information processing is costly. We find that attention allocation depends on the consumer?s prior belief about whether the product matches her needs or not, and on her unit information processing cost. A consumer processes both ?confirmatory? and ?disconfirmatory? information to her prior belief, but to different degrees under different conditions. Generally speaking, if the consumer has an extreme prior, or if the unit cost of processing information is high such that only a small amount of information is optimally processed, she processes more confirmatory than disconfirmatory information; this offers a rational explanation for the phenomenon known as ?confirmation bias.? We also find that a seller can benefit by influencing the consumer?s attention allocation by strategically choosing how much favorable and unfavorable information to make available for the consumer to process and by influencing the information processing cost, where the optimal strategy depends on the ability to adjust product price. Surprisingly, a seller has a lower incentive to suppress unfavorable information when the consumer has a worse prior belief about product fit. We illustrate our model with an application to information provision in product reviews.",1
Store within a Store,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"In a store-within-a-store arrangement, retailers essentially rent out retail space to manufacturers and give them complete autonomy over retail decisions, such as pricing and in-store service. This intriguing retailing format appears in an increasing number of large department stores worldwide. The authors use a theoretical model to investigate the economic incentives a retailer faces when deciding on this arrangement. The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space. An extension of the model to the case of competing retailers shows that the store-within-a-store arrangement can moderate interstore competition.",1
Get It? Got It. Good! Enhancing New Product Acceptance by Facilitating Resolution of Extreme Incongruity,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Highly innovative products may offer consumers greater benefits than incrementally new products, yet they have a higher failure rate. The current research addresses the challenge faced by new products that are extremely different from existing offerings by drawing on theory regarding the evaluation of schema incongruity. The authors posit that consumers' acceptance of extremely incongruent products will increase when firms use strategies that facilitate cognitive flexibility and thus the likelihood that consumers will be able to make sense of incongruent new products. The authors examine the influence of three manipulations of cognitive flexibility?positive affect, a future (vs. past) launch description, and a cognitive flexibility prime?on evaluations of new products. The results from four experiments show that these factors facilitate participants' ability to make sense of extremely incongruent new products and that incongruity resolution leads to more positive evaluations. The results also indicate that understanding the benefits provided by extremely new products, rather than affect arising from resolution, leads to higher evaluations of these products.",1
"Speed Up, Size Down: How Animated Movement Speed in Product Videos Influences Size Assessment and Product Evaluation",Journal of Marketing,2020,"Digital ads often display video content in which immobile products are presented as if they are moving spontaneously. Six studies demonstrate a speed-based scaling effect, such that consumers estimate the size of an immobile product to be smaller when it is animated to move faster in videos, due to the inverse size?speed association they have learned from the domain of animate agents (e.g., animals, humans). Supporting a cross-domain knowledge transfer model of learned size?speed association, this speed-based scaling effect is (1) reduced when consumers perceive a product?s movement pattern as less similar to animate agents? movement patterns, (2) reversed when a positive size?speed association in the base domain of animate agents is made accessible, (3) attenuated for consumers who have more knowledge about the target product domain, and (4) mitigated when explicit product size information is highlighted. Furthermore, by decreasing assessed product size, fast animated movement speed can either positively or negatively influence willingness to pay, depending on consumers? size preferences.",0
Do Consumers Always Spend more when Coupon Face Value is Larger? The Inverted U-Shaped Effect of Coupon Face Value on Consumer Spending Level,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Commonly, a coupon can be applied to one of several vertically differentiated products sold at different prices within the same product line of a brand. With such a product-line coupon, consumers need to decide on the specific product to buy, resulting in different levels of consumer spending. One field data set and four lab experiments demonstrate that the relationship between coupon face value and consumer spending level may not always be intuitively positive; under certain circumstances, it could take an inverted U-shape. The authors develop a threshold-based model to explain the inverted U-shaped effect of coupon face value on consumer spending level and show that this effect occurs when the price level of products is high, when consumers have a strong saving orientation, when they experience low information load from processing a small number of products, when they are inclined to engage in thorough product comparison, or when they have a weak preexisting preference for a specific level of product benefit.",0
Intercompetitor Licensing and Product Innovation,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This article explores how intercompetitor licensing between an incumbent and an entrant affects market competition and the entrant?s optimal product quality. In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant?s optimal quality depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent?s product quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant?s optimal quality when the entrant?s core technology can offer a significant quality improvement over the incumbent?s. By contrast, if the entrant?s technology can raise its product quality only incrementally over the incumbent?s product quality, the royalty contract will tend to reduce the entrant?s optimal quality. A wide range of royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g., alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent, alternative licensing contract).",1
Competition of Content Acquisition and Distribution Under Consumer Multipurchase,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In many markets, such as video streaming or information services, a consumer may purchase multiple competing products or services. The existing theoretical literature typically assumes that each consumer can buy only one product. This article explicitly models the consumer?s multipurchase behavior and examines an upstream content creator?s content production and selling strategies as well as competing downstream distributors? content acquisition and pricing strategies. The authors find that in contrast to the case of single-product purchase, under multiproduct purchase, only one distributor will acquire the creator?s new content in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the content distributors are not highly differentiated (each having a limited amount of unique content), the content creator will reduce new content production, leading to lower profits for both the content creator and the content distributors. By contrast, when the distributors are already highly differentiated with a substantial amount of unique content, the content creator will increase its content production, leading to higher profits for both the content creator and the distributors. The authors show that their main results and insights are robust to several alternative assumptions.",1
Consumer Search and Filtering on Online Retail Platforms,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This article examines how the consumer?s search cost and filtering on a retail platform affect the platform, the third-party sellers, and the consumers. The authors show that, given the platform?s percentage referral fee, a lower search cost can either increase or decrease the platform?s profit. By contrast, if the platform optimally adjusts its referral fee, a lower search cost will increase the platform?s profit. As the consumer?s search cost decreases, if the platform?s demand elasticity increases significantly, the platform should reduce its fee, potentially resulting in an all-win outcome for the platform, the sellers, and the consumers; otherwise, a lower search cost will increase the platform?s optimal fee percentage, potentially leading to higher equilibrium retail prices. Furthermore, the availability of filtering on the platform will in expectation induce consumers to search fewer products but buy products with higher match values, and filtering can either increase or decrease equilibrium retail prices. When filtering reveals only a small amount of the products? match-value variations, it will benefit the platform, the sellers, and the consumers. This article shows that the effects of filtering and those of a decrease in search cost are qualitatively different.",1
Climbing the Wrong Ladder: The Mismatch between Consumers' Preference for Subgoal Sequences and Actual Goal Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"When pursuing goals that involve subgoals of varying levels of difficulty, consumers prefer to follow a difficult-to-easy sequence when completing the subgoals because they believe that such a sequence renders the overall goal easier to achieve. However, consumers are actually more successful when they follow an easy-to-difficult sequence when completing subgoals. In seven studies, the authors present consistent evidence for this mismatch and explore the value of subgoals as an important boundary condition.",1
The Impact of Advertising and R&D on Bankruptcy Survival: A Double-Edged Sword,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm?s expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm?s assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm?s suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court?s decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%?38% (18%?21%) of the bankrupt firm?s debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm?s advertising and R&D.",0
EXPRESS: The Importance of Price Beliefs in Consumer Search,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"A consumer?s decision to engage in search depends on the beliefs the consumer has about an unknown product characteristic such as price. Given beliefs are rarely observed, researchers typically assume that consumers have rational expectations or update beliefs consistent with Bayesian updating. These assumptions are not only restrictive, but additionally, do not afford the researcher, or the retailer, an opportunity to price discriminate among consumers based on heterogeneity in beliefs. We first show, through Monte Carlo experiments, how these assumptions impact estimates of search cost. Next, we design an incentive-aligned online study where subjects search over the price of a homogeneous good, and we elicit distributions of price beliefs before and after each search. Based on data collected from a nationally representative panel, we find substantial heterogeneity in prior price beliefs. We find that subjects update their beliefs in response to search outcomes, but they deviate from Bayesian updating in that they under-react to new information. Importantly, we show that (i) assuming Bayesian updating does not significantly bias search cost estimates at the aggregate level provided the researcher accounts for heterogeneous prior beliefs, (ii) eliciting heterogeneity in prior expected prices is much more important than eliciting heterogeneity in prior price uncertainty, and (iii) a retailer can increase profits through third-degree price discrimination by recognizing the heterogeneity in prior beliefs.",1
To Bargain or Not to Bargain: The Role of Fixed Costs in Price Negotiations,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Retailers routinely allow consumers to negotiate a discount off the posted price for big-ticket items such as home appliances and automobiles, and on online platforms such as Amazon and eBay. The profitability of such a strategy, relative to selling only at posted prices, depends on consumers? willingness to initiate a negotiation and ability to negotiate a discount. In this article, the authors incorporate consumers? decision of whether to negotiate into a demand model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from consumers? ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28 to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs? not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing strategy and consumer surplus. Ignoring these costs results in biased estimates of consumers? willingness to pay, translating to annual losses of $1.6 million in the current study setting.",1
Marketing-Mix Response Across Retail Formats: The Role of Shopping Trip Types,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The authors study differences in the effects of prices, nonprice promotions, and brand line length on brand shares at different retail formats. Their conceptual framework rests on the presence of trip-level fixed and category-level variable utility components and shows how the trade-off between these components results in (1) different formats visited on different types of shopping trips and (2) differential marginal sensitivities of brand shares to changes in marketing-mix variables across trip types. Together, these provide predictions on how marketing-mix variables differentially affect brand shares at various retail formats. The authors use Nielsen Homescan and store-level data from 2011?2014 and analyze the top ten spending product categories across four retail formats?convenience stores, drugstores, supermarkets, and mass merchandisers?in over 200 Nielsen markets. Implications for brand manufacturers managing the marketing mix across different formats are offered. JEL codes: M310, L11, D4",0
Designed to Succeed: Dimensions of Product Design and Their Impact on Market Share,Journal of Marketing,2016,"This research examines the relationship between product design and market share, a topic of considerable significance that has not been addressed in the published literature. Drawing from diverse disciplines such as marketing, industrial design, and engineering, the authors conceptualize design as being composed of three distinct product-level dimensions: function, form, and ergonomics. Furthermore, the authors examine the interplay among these design dimensions and their impact on the market share of a product. Empirical results using integrated repeated cross-sectional data obtained from several different sources in the U.S. light vehicle industry reveal an important strategic trade-off concerning design capabilities. Firms can either ?design for satisfaction,? by investing in both function and ergonomics, or ?design for delight,? by investing in form design capabilities so as to reap share rewards. The authors also show that older-generation vehicles with superior form designs do much better in terms of share than corresponding older vehicles with higher levels of either function or ergonomics. Implications of these results for academic researchers and managers are discussed.",0
Stockouts in Online Retailing,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Demand uncertainty and supply rigidity often create inventory shortages. Inventory shortages can have adverse consequences on both short- and long-term customer behaviors. Using data from an online grocer, this study has the following three main objectives: First, the authors empirically investigate the true nature of shortage costs by examining how stockouts and fulfillment rates affect customer's purchase behavior in both the short and long run. Second, the authors study how consumers? reactions to inventory shortages differ across customer segments. They use these observations to illustrate how the seller might benefit from prioritizing fulfillment policies according to customer traits. Third, the authors study how the impact of inventory shortages varies across product categories. Using these insights, the authors discuss how the seller should allocate limited resources to improve order fulfillment across these categories. Overall, the authors find that stockout rates have a dramatic but nonlinear impact on the seller's profitability. This suggests that the firm can achieve many of the benefits of improving fulfillment rates through small decreases in stockout rates. They also find significant differences in how different types of customers respond to stockouts and that prioritizing inventory according to transaction history measures and basket contents can lead to large increases in contribution while only requiring moderate reductions in stockout rates.",1
Two Roads to Updating Brand Personality Impressions: Trait versus Evaluative Inferencing,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"This research examines the dynamic process of inference updating. The authors present a framework that delineates two mechanisms that guide the updating of personality trait inferences about brands. The results of three experiments show that chronics (those for whom the trait is accessible) update their initial inferences on the basis of the trait implications of new information. Notably, nonchronics (those for whom the trait is not accessible) also update their initial inferences, but they do so on the basis of the evaluative implications of new information. The framework adds to the inference-making literature by uncovering two distinct paths of inference updating and by emphasizing the moderating role of trait accessibility. The findings have direct implications for marketers attempting to understand the construction of brand personality, and they emphasize the constantly evolving nature of brand perceptions and the notion that both the consumer and the marketer have important roles to play in this process.",1
Brand Concept Maps: A Methodology for Identifying Brand Association Networks,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Understanding brand equity involves identifying the network of strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in memory. This article introduces a methodology, Brand Concept Maps, for eliciting brand association networks (maps) from consumers and aggregating individual maps into a consensus map of the brand. Consensus brand maps include the core brand associations that define the brand's image and show which brand associations are linked directly to the brand, which associations are linked indirectly to the brand, and which associations are grouped together. Two studies illustrate the Brand Concept Maps methodology and provide evidence of its reliability and validity.",1
Does ?Liking? Lead to Loving? The Impact of Joining a Brand's Social Network on Marketing Outcomes,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Does ?liking? a brand on Facebook cause a person to view it more favorably? Or is ?liking? simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? The authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers' preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of when and whether consumers ?like? brands on social media. In addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether ?liking? brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. When consumers see that a friend has ?liked? a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement. Taken together, five experiments and two meta-analyses (N > 14,000) suggest that turning ?liking? into improved brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends may require more than just the click of a button.",1
Things that Go Bump in the Mind: How Behavioral Economics Could Invigorate Marketing,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In their article, Ho, Lim, and Camerer (2006) lead by example. They identify principles from behavioral economics, and rather than simply exhort their readers to pay attention, they actually produce impressive demonstrations of how these principles can be applied to substantive marketing problems. It is easy to argue that these ideas are important, but it is more difficult to demonstrate that importance. Implicitly, Ho, Lim, and Camerer send a message of encouragement: Behaviorally realistic assumptions are not problems to be ignored; they are opportunities. Formal models can capture psychologically realistic concerns. Together, they should be the grist for the next generation of marketing mills.",1
Cognitive Lock-In and the Power Law of Practice,Journal of Marketing,2003,The authors suggest that learning is an important factor in electronic environments and that efficiency resulting from learning can be modeled with the power law of practice. They show that most Web sites can be characterized by decreasing visit times and that generally those sites with the fastest learning curves show the highest rates of purchasing.,0
Ghost Ads: Improving the Economics of Measuring Online Ad Effectiveness,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"To measure the effects of advertising, marketers must know how consumers would behave had they not seen the ads. The authors develop a methodology they call ?ghost ads,? which facilitates this comparison by identifying the control group counterparts of the exposed consumers in a randomized experiment. The authors show that, relative to public service announcement and intent-to-treat A/B tests, ghost ads can reduce the cost of experimentation, improve measurement precision, deliver the relevant strategic baseline, and work with modern ad platforms that optimize ad delivery in real time. The authors also describe a variant, ?predicted ghost ad? methodology, which is compatible with online display advertising platforms; their implementation records more than 100 million predicted ghost ads per day. The authors demonstrate the methodology with an online retailer's display retargeting campaign. They show novel evidence that retargeting can work: the ads lifted website visits by 17.2% and purchases by 10.5%. Compared with intent-to-treat and public service announcement experiments, advertisers can measure ad lift just as precisely while spending at least an order of magnitude less.",1
Drivers of Success for Market Entry into China and India,Journal of Marketing,2008,"China and India are the fastest-growing major markets in the world and the most popular markets for foreign entrants. However, no study has examined the success or failure of these entries. Using a new definition of success and a uniquely compiled archival database, the authors analyze whether and why firms that entered China and India succeeded or failed. The most important findings are rather counterintuitive: Smaller firms are more successful than larger firms, and firms entering more open emerging markets have less success. Other findings are that success is greater with earlier entry, greater control of entry mode, and shorter cultural and economic distances between the home and the host countries. Importantly, with or without control for these drivers, firms have less success in India than in China. The authors discuss the reasons for and implications of these findings.",0
Persistence and Learning: Success Factors of Taiwanese Firms in International Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"A relatively recent trend in international marketing is the rising number of firms from nontriad countries seeking growth and profits from foreign markets. Yet no study has examined the international performance of these firms. How successful have their efforts been? What factors drive their success? The authors examine these questions by building a theory-based conceptual framework that links firm international performance to its antecedents. They test the framework using a sample of 110 Taiwanese firms. The key findings are as follows: (1) The internationalization?performance relationship is characterized by a joint U + N shape, (2) learning capacity is positively associated with international performance, and (3) research and development intensity is not a key driver of performance. Though based on a sample of Taiwanese firms only, these results imply that nontriad firms embarking on internationalization must persist despite early setbacks, must develop their learning capacity, and should not develop extensive research and development capabilities while internationalizing. The authors conclude with a discussion of the reasons for these findings.",0
The Role of Relational Knowledge Stores in Interfirm Partnering,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Drawing on the notions of relational capabilities and absorptive capacity, the authors examine the effects of interactional, functional, and environmental knowledge stores on relationship quality and relationship portfolio effectiveness. The results suggest that the knowledge stores affect the outcome variables differently and that the effects vary by levels of industry turbulence.",0
Sales-to-Marketing Job Transitions,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Careers evolve over time and can take many paths as they develop. Within marketing and sales, a common variant of career progression is to begin in a sales position and then advance internally into a marketing role. Doing so provides employees with unique but complementary sets of skills, experiences, and perspectives that may increase their efficacy as marketers. However, sales-to-marketing job transitions (SMJTs) can also be suboptimal and result in adverse outcomes. Although the sales?marketing interface literature has examined how the two functions work together, the SMJT process is unclear. To provide an understanding of this phenomenon, the authors conduct in-depth interviews across a host of different companies and industries with 56 informants who successfully transitioned intraorganizationally from sales to marketing, informants who transitioned but did not remain in marketing, and executives. They develop a theoretical model consisting of transition motivation, acquisition, preparation, and encounter. They also advance individual and organizational facilitators of SMJTs and discuss SMJTs? potential positive and negative effects on the organization.",0
The Evolution of Loyalty Intentions,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The drivers of customer loyalty intentions are dynamic. What remains unclear is how these intentions evolve through the introduction and growth phases of a life cycle. Using a longitudinal study of cellular phone customers, the authors demonstrate that loyalty intentions are a function of perceived value early in the life cycle. Over time, more affective attitudes toward the brand and the relationship with the company come to mediate the effects of value on intentions. The results suggest that from the introduction to the growth stage of a life cycle, managers must adapt from improving value per se to measuring and managing relationships and brands directly.",0
Customer Portfolio Management: Toward a Dynamic Theory of Exchange Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Management of an entire portfolio of customers who are at different relationship stages requires a dynamic theory of exchange relationships that captures the trade-offs between scale economies and lifetime customer value. This article contributes to the understanding of relationship management by developing a typology of exchange relationship mechanisms and a model of relationship dynamics and by simulating the model to provide guidelines for customer portfolio management. An important insight from the research is that a key to the creation of value through closer relationships lies in bringing weaker relationships into a portfolio in the first place. Another insight is that firms that position themselves toward offerings with low economies of scale, such as personal services, must build closer relationships to create value.",0
A Career between Theory and Practice,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The author describes his career in marketing research, which involves a series of nonacademic positions. He argues that the commercial market research environment provides challenges that motivate methodological innovation, and he discusses the development of adaptive conjoint analysis in response to client problems. He suggests that young people should keep their options open, avoid early specialization, and follow their interests.",1
In Favor of Closer Ties,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The author believes that marketing would be strengthened by closer relationships between academics and practitioners. He argues that the commercial market research environment can be stimulating for methodological development, and he suggests that everyone would benefit if academics and practitioners had experience in both environments.",1
Determinants of Joint Action in International Channels of Distribution: The Moderating Role of Psychic Distance,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Joint action, a key element of relational exchanges, has largely been ignored in the international channel literature, and not much is known about the determinants of joint action in cross-border exchanges. In view of this, the authors investigate the role of interchannel communication in motivating buyers for joint action in cross-border channel exchange relationships. The authors also propose and examine the moderating effect of psychic distance, a crucial aspect of cross-border exchanges. They use partial least squares to analyze survey data collected from Taiwanese importers, and the findings reveal that trust and satisfaction fully mediate the relationships between frequent and bidirectional communication and joint action. The authors also confirm the detrimental moderating impact of psychic distance on the relationships between communication facets and relational mediators (trust and satisfaction). However, psychic distance does not hinder the relationships between the relational mediators and joint action. The research provides insights into two underresearched areas?namely, joint action and intercultural communication?and advances theoretical understanding on how to encourage joint action in psychically distinct buyers and sellers.",0
Behavioral Implications of International Social Media Advertising: An Investigation of Intervening and Contingency Factors,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Despite the rapid growth of social media and the enthusiasm surrounding social media advertising (SMA), scant theoretical and empirical knowledge exists on the cross-border effectiveness of SMA and its influence on consumer behavior in the social media environment. This research develops a four-stage belief?value?attitude?behavior framework to understand the intervening role of SMA value and attitude and reflect how consumers react to SMA across cultures and global social media types. The results confirm the mediating effects of value and attitude and reveal that positive attitude toward SMA increases social media?specific behaviors (i.e., message and social interaction behaviors). The moderating effect results of culture reveal a greater impact of infotainment on SMA value and of credibility on SMA value and attitude in the higher-uncertainty-avoidance culture. Infotainment has a larger effect on SMA value and attitude in global content community sites than in global social networking sites, but there is a reverse moderating effect on the impact of credibility. The research provides a better theoretical understanding of consumers? behavioral responses to SMA in international marketplaces.",0
The Internationalization of Small High-Technology Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This study of 196 small high-technology firms embraces the areas of the internationalization of entrepreneurially led firms and the early stages of the international growth and development of high-technology firms. The author's conceptual stance is that the early internationalization of small firms should be viewed as an holistic process, that is, one in which interrrelated and even integrated decisions and processes combine to accomplish a firm's individual pattern of internationalization. The study explores firms? patterns of international development through their establishment of cross-border activity in key value chains and associated service activities.",0
On the Optimality of Delegating Pricing Authority to the Sales Force,Journal of Marketing,2001,"An important decision facing sales managers today is precisely how much pricing authority should be delegated to the sales force. Received theory suggests that the salesperson's superior information about customers' valuations will invariably make price delegation profitable for the firm. The empirical evidence, however, reveals that firms that grant full pricing authority generate lower profits than firms that limit pricing authority. Given this state of affairs, the author develops and analyzes a formal model that examines the optimality of delegating pricing authority to the sales force. The model preserves the notion of superior information assumed in the literature but considers as well a negative feature of much concern to practitioners, namely, the suboptimal substitution of selling effort by price discounting. The model reveals that providing the salesperson with full pricing authority is not always optimal. Specifically, in some environments, it is appropriate to limit pricing authority because this decision forces the salesperson to target high-valuation customers. In addition, the model predicts that the commission rate offered to the salesperson should be higher when pricing authority is limited. The author concludes by summarizing the context, calculus, and implications of the model with a view to assisting managers charged with the price-delegation decision.",0
"Free Cash Flow, Agency Costs, and the Affordability Method of Advertising Budgeting",Journal of Marketing,2002,"The allocation of excess cash has long been recognized in the finance literature as an important aspect of the basic agency conflict between managers and owners. In the advertising budgeting context, marketing scholars report that firms possessing high levels of cash tend to spend more on advertising than what seems necessary or desirable. Indeed, this positive link between excess cash and advertising expenditures constitutes a part of what is commonly referred to as the affordability method of advertising budgeting. Surprisingly, there has been little research that attempts to view this association as a manifestation of agency costs. Therefore, in this article, the authors examine whether agency costs, as measured by managerial ownership, moderate the relationship between excess cash and advertising expenditures. On the basis of received theory, the authors conceptualize that agency costs will first decrease, then increase, and then decrease again with the level of managerial ownership. Accordingly, the authors hypothesize and find that the fraction of incremental earnings reinvested in advertising follows the same pattern in managerial ownership. These findings support the notion that the use of the affordability method is driven, in part, by agency costs. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.",0
Uncle Sam Rising: Performance Implications of Business-to-Government Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This article uses multimethod approaches to develop a conceptual foundation for and empirical evidence of the performance implications of business-to-government (B2G) relationships. In-depth interviews reveal unique characteristics that differentiate B2G exchanges from commercial exchanges (e.g., procurement mission; regulations and oversight; scale, scope, and planning horizon) and highlight the resultant cost?benefit trade-offs for firms in this environment. Empirical longitudinal analyses of secondary data show that a firm?s government customer emphasis (firm revenue dependence on B2G relationships) exerts a positive nonlinear effect on firm value but also increases firm risk (idiosyncratic and systematic). Government customer breadth and depth are two critical customer portfolio characteristics that moderate these effects. High government customer breadth creates more costs associated with an increasing government customer emphasis, mitigating the positive nonlinear effect on firm value. However, breadth provides diversification benefits that alleviate the increase in idiosyncratic risk that comes with greater government customer emphasis. Deep B2G relationships give firms key customer domain knowledge and insights, which help counteract the increased idiosyncratic and systematic risks of government customer emphasis. The authors discuss the implications for marketing theory and practice.",0
The Direct and Indirect Effects of Advertising Spending on Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Marketing decision makers are increasingly aware of the importance of shareholder value maximization, which calls for an evaluation of the long-term effects of their actions on product-market response and investor response. However, the marketing literature to date has focused on the sales or profit response of marketing actions, and the goals of marketing have traditionally been formulated from a customer perspective. Recently, there have been a few studies of the long-term investor response to marketing actions. The current research investigates one important aspect of this impact, the long-term relationship between advertising spending and market capitalization. The authors hypothesize that advertising can have a direct effect on valuation (i.e., an effect beyond its indirect effect through sales revenue and profit response). The empirical results across two industries provide support for the hypothesis that advertising spending has a positive, long-term impact on own firms? market capitalization and may have a negative impact on the valuation of a competitor of comparable size. The authors quantify the magnitude of this investor response effect for and discuss its implications for further research.",0
Continuous Supplier Performance Improvement: Effects of Collaborative Communication and Control,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Manufacturing firms seek continuous supplier performance improvement because this outcome makes them more competitive in downstream markets. Although manufacturing firms use a range of tools to effect continuous supplier performance improvement, the author focuses on two that are especially important?collaborative communication and control?and poses the following research questions: (1) How does collaborative communication foster continuous supplier performance improvement? and (2) What are the combined effects of collaborative communication and control? The results from a survey of 153 manufacturer?supplier dyads show that collaborative communication fosters continuous supplier performance improvement by enhancing supplier knowledge (of manufacturer needs) and by building supplier affective commitment (toward the manufacturer). With respect to the combined effects of communication and control, the results show that capability control enhances the positive effects of both supplier knowledge and supplier affective commitment on continuous supplier performance improvement, whereas process control undermines the effect of supplier knowledge on the outcome. This pattern of results suggests that manufacturing firms should emphasize capability control and deemphasize process control to foster continuous supplier performance improvement.",0
Salesperson Influence on Product Development: Insights from a Study of Small Manufacturing Organizations,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research addresses three questions: (1) How do salespeople get their desired product modifications implemented within organizations? (2) What effect does salesperson trustworthiness have on the means they adopt to get product modifications implemented? and (3) What are the performance outcomes of the modified products? The results from a survey of 149 product managers in small manufacturing organizations suggest that two influence strategies?rationality and exchange?have a positive impact and that two influence strategies?coalition building and upward appeal?have an inverse impact on product modification implementation. The results also show that salesperson trustworthiness enhances the positive effects of rationality and exchange while mitigating the inverse effects of coalition building and upward appeal. Finally, the results show that product modification implementation has a positive effect on the product's performance in the marketplace. Collectively, the results suggest that salespeople should adopt the rationality and exchange strategies to get their desired product modifications implemented while also developing a reputation for trustworthiness and that it pays for organizations to listen to their salespeople.",0
Customer Knowledge Development: Antecedents and Impact on New Product Performance,Journal of Marketing,2004,"By enhancing the fit between new product features and customer preferences, the customer knowledge development process fosters new product success. Despite this significant benefit, there is considerable variance in the extent to which firms engage in this process in their new product development projects. This is because not all firms can meet the resource, strategic flexibility, and motivational requirements of the process. In this research, the authors develop a nomological network wherein they identify (1) the organizational actions that enable effective implementation of the customer knowledge development process, (2) the characteristics of new product development projects that moderate the effects of these actions, and (3) the outcomes that are generated by the process. The results from a survey of 165 marketing managers who had recently participated in new product development projects provide substantial support for the nomological network. The authors explore the theoretical and managerial implications that arise from their results and provide future research directions.",0
Consumer Disidentification and Its Effects on Domestic Product Purchases: An Empirical Investigation in the Netherlands,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Consumers? local bias is an important determinant of domestic product purchase behavior. Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have investigated this phenomenon using the consumer ethnocentrism model. However, the research reported herein demonstrates that such an approach provides an incomplete picture at best. This research provides an initial test of the consumer disidentification (CDI) construct. In contrast with consumer ethnocentrism, the CDI model predicts that consumers? repulsion toward their domestic country negatively affects the purchase of products made in their domestic country or by domestic firms. The model is tested using survey data from 1534 second-generation immigrants who were born in and live in the Netherlands. Structural equation modeling supports the model and shows that CDI has a significant impact on buying decisions beyond the effect of consumer ethnocentrism. The results further show that for second-generation Turkish immigrants, acculturation and ethnic identification are important predictors of both consumer ethnocentrism and CDI. The article discusses the implications of these findings for research and practice.",0
Relational Governance and Control Mechanisms of Export Ventures: An Examination across Relationship Length,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Relational governance and control mechanisms are important means of managing interfirm relationships. Yet, the effectiveness of different governance mechanisms remains equivocal, especially in the international context. In this study, the authors investigate the value of relational and control governance across relationship length. Using a survey of 217 export ventures from China, they find that relational governance is not effective for short-term relationships but that it becomes effective in the long run. Output control improves export performance across short- and long-term relationships, whereas process control has its limits and weakens export performance for short-term relationships. In addition, the findings show that relational governance positively moderates the effects of output and process control on export performance for long-term relationships.",0
How Can International Ventures Utilize Marketing Capability in Emerging Markets? Its Contingent Effect on New Product Development,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Whether international ventures can benefit from their marketing capability in emerging markets is a critical but underresearched issue. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), the authors propose that marketing capability can enhance international ventures? new product performance. However, its effect is contingent on environmental forces (i.e., market uncertainty and technological turbulence) in the highly uncertain and turbulent environments of emerging markets. Using survey data of international ventures in high-tech industries in China, the authors find that marketing capability is less effective for new product development when firms face high levels of market uncertainty or technological turbulence. At that time, enhancing knowledge breadth represents a critical strategic solution to address the decreased efficacy of marketing capability in driving innovation.",0
The Boundary Conditions of Export Relational Governance: A ?Strategy Tripod? Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Manufacturers often use relational governance to manage interfirm relationships with their distributors. Yet recent literature has cautioned that relational governance may only offer conditional benefits. In this study, the authors integrate the resource-, industry-, and institution-based views to examine whether there is a limit to the positive effect of relational governance on export performance. Furthermore, the authors investigate two conditioning factors: industry uncertainty and cross-national institutional distance. Using a survey of 184 export ventures from China, the authors find that relational governance has an inverted U-shaped relationship with performance. In addition, the findings show that the export performance effect of relational governance becomes less effective in uncertain industry environments, but cross-country institutional distance enhances the value of relational governance.",0
Technological Capability Growth and Performance Outcome: Foreign versus Local Firms in China,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"This study examines the growth and performance impact of technological capability (TC) in China. The authors posit that foreign and local firms exhibit different TC growth patterns and that TC has differential performance effects for these two types of firms. From a multilevel analysis of five-year panel data of 448 technology-oriented firms, they find that, in general, foreign firms possess higher levels of TC, whereas local firms can develop their TC faster than foreign firms. Furthermore, compared with foreign firms, local firms experience a stronger performance return from their TC; however, foreign firms have a higher growth rate in the contribution of TC to their performance over time. Moreover, firms can develop TC faster in regions with better intellectual property protection, and TC exerts a stronger effect on performance when industrial uncertainty is higher.",0
How Encouraging Niceness Can Incentivize Nastiness: An Unintended Consequence of Advertising Reform,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Enacted in an effort to discourage negative political advertising, American regulations mandate that candidates endorse their ads (?My name is ___, and I approve this message.?). Four studies suggest that mandatory endorsements enhance the perceived credibility of some ads these regulations were designed to discourage. This research tests for what types of messages mandatory endorsements have this effect, and why. Mandatory endorsements boosted evaluations of policy-focused attack ads?those typically plagued by overcomeable skepticism?but had no consistent effect on positive or character-focused ads. Mandatory endorsements boost ad believability?largely outside of participants' awareness?for two reasons: (1) the tagline offers a legitimizing association with regulation and (2) the candidates' own personally delivered endorsement language offers an implicit promise of the ads' truth value. The authors discuss how these findings bring order to and extend previous work on mandatory endorsements and ironic effects of communications requirements. Finally, they consider how regulations could be reformed to promote the public good by informing (without misleading) the electorate.",1
Anchoring in Payment: Evaluating a Judgmental Heuristic in Field Experimental Settings,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Anchoring, the biasing of estimates toward a previously considered value, is a long-standing and oft-studied phenomenon in consumer research. However, most anchoring work has been in the lab, and the results from field work have been mixed. Here, the authors use real transactions from an empirically investigated and commercially-employed pricing scheme (?pay what you want?) to better understand how anchors influence payments. Sixteen field studies (N = 21,997) and four hypothetical studies (N = 3,174) reveal four main points: (1) Although anchoring replicates both with and without financial consequences (Studies 1?2), the percentile rank gap between anchors in the distribution of payments is a much stronger predictor of anchoring emerging than merely the absolute gap between the anchors on a number line (Studies 3?5). (2) Low anchors influence payments more than high anchors (Studies 6a?b). (3) Findings from the literature that should enhance anchoring effects?anchor precision, descriptive and injunctive norms, nonsuggestions?yield null results in payment (Studies 7?13). (4) The above patterns do not emerge in hypothetical settings (Studies 14a?d), in which anchoring is as big and reliable as the literature has previously suggested.",1
The Performance Implications of Designing Multiple Channels to Fit with Strategy and Environment,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Applying a configuration-theoretic approach to study multiple channels, the authors hypothesize that multiple-channel systems make their greatest contributions to firm performance when their structures are properly aligned with their firms' business-level strategies and with environmental conditions. A conceptual model incorporating these variables is supported in an empirical study of responses from executives at 291 electronic component manufacturers. The results confirm the existence of two theoretically ideal configurations. As hypothesized, channels in these ideal configurations make greater contributions to their firms' performance than do channels in alternative configurations. Moreover, a profile deviation analysis shows that a channel system's contribution to its firm's performance is greatest when that channel system's structural profile is closest to the profiles of top-contributing channel systems operating under similar strategic and environmental conditions. The authors present specific guidelines to help managers design distribution systems for different combinations of environment (e.g., with high and low dynamism, munificence, and diversity) and strategy (cost leadership and differentiation).",0
Marketing's Integration with R&D and Manufacturing: A Cross-Regional Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"With the emergence of global teams, marketing managers are not only confronted with interdepartmental issues, but cultural issues as well. As yet, most literature has focused on interdepartmental integration within a single-country company, indicating that integration via interaction and collaboration improves performance success. The question is whether this framework holds in a global context between marketing, R&D, and manufacturing.A research study of 500 marketing, manufacturing, and R&D managers was undertaken to address this question and determine the influences that interaction and collaboration may have on performance across U.S., European, and Far Eastern companies. Research further compared the levels of interaction and collaboration used by different departments across these three regions. Findings suggest that a global framework may exist, which highlights collaboration and, to a lesser degree, interaction as factors in performance success. Findings also suggest that there may be certain culturally specific approaches for managing interdepartmental relationships.",0
When Hostile Consumers Wreak Havoc on Your Brand: The Phenomenon of Consumer Brand Sabotage,Journal of Marketing,2016,"In recent years, companies have been confronted with a new type of negative consumer behavior: consumers who have turned hostile and who are strongly determined to cause damage to the brand. Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e.g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer?brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental escalation processes of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research.",0
The Self-Expressive Customization of a Product Can Improve Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This research demonstrates that the self-expressive customization of a product can improve performance on tasks performed using the customized product. Five studies show that the effect is robust across different types of tasks (e.g., persistence tasks, concentration tasks, agility tasks). The evidence further shows that the effect is not due to changes in product efficacy beliefs, feelings of competence, feelings of accomplishment, mood, task desirability, goal activation, or goal attainability. Instead, the self-expressive customization of a product extends an identity (e.g., personal identity, group identity) into the product. When the product is subsequently used to pursue a goal whose desired outcome can affirm the extended identity, performance improves.",1
The Impact of Product Recalls on Future Product Reliability and Future Accidents: Evidence from the Automobile Industry,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Although the goal of a product recall program is to enhance safety, little is known about whether firms learn from product recalls. This study tests the direct effect of product recalls on future accidents and future recall frequency and their indirect effect through future product reliability in the automobile industry. The authors test the hypotheses on 459 make/year observations involving 27 automobile makers between 1995 and 2011. The findings suggest that increases in recall magnitude lead to decreases in future number of injuries and recalls. This effect, in turn, is partially mediated by future changes in product reliability. The results also suggest that the positive relationship between recall magnitude and future product reliability is (1) stronger for firms with higher shared product assets and (2) weaker for brands of higher prior quality. The findings are robust across alternate measures and alternate model specifications and offer valuable insights for managerial practice and public policy.",0
The Differential Impact of New Product Development ?Make/Buy? Choices on Immediate and Future Product Quality: Insights from the Automobile Industry,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This article examines the impact of new product development (NPD) ?make/buy? choices on product quality using data from the automobile industry. Although the business press has lamented that NPD outsourcing compromises product quality, there is no systematic evidence to support or refute this assertion. Against this backdrop, this study tests a contingency model of the impact of NPD make/buy decisions on immediate and future product quality. The hypotheses are tested using data on NPD make/buy choices of 173 models of 12 automobile firms in the United States between 2007 and 2014. The authors find that whereas NPD buy has a more positive impact on immediate product quality, NPD make has a more positive impact on future product quality. Furthermore, the immediate product quality impact of NPD buy is stronger when (1) technologies are more complex and (2) firm NPD capability is higher. In contrast, the future product quality impact of NPD make is stronger when (1) there is postlaunch adverse feedback and (2) firm NPD capability is higher. The study highlights the complex trade-offs associated with NPD make/buy decisions and offers valuable insights on how firms could manage these decisions.",0
"Marketing Agility: The Concept, Antecedents, and a Research Agenda",Journal of Marketing,2020,"Changes in the way customers shop, accompanied by an explosion of customer touchpoints and fast-changing competitive and technological dynamics, have led to an increased emphasis on agile marketing. The objective of this article is to conceptualize and investigate the emerging concept of marketing agility. The authors synthesize the literature from marketing and allied disciplines and insights from in-depth interviews with 22 senior managers. Marketing agility is defined as the extent to which an entity rapidly iterates between making sense of the market and executing marketing decisions to adapt to the market. It is conceptualized as occurring across different organizational levels and shown to be distinct from related concepts in marketing and allied fields. The authors highlight the firm challenges in executing marketing agility, including ensuring brand consistency, scaling agility across the marketing ecosystem, managing data privacy concerns, pursuing marketing agility as a fad, and hiring marketing leaders. The authors identify the antecedents of marketing agility at the organizational, team, marketing leadership, and employee levels and provide a roadmap for future research. The authors caution that marketing agility may not be well-suited for all firms and all marketing activities.",0
Grouping Euroconsumers: A Culture-Based Clustering Approach,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"The move toward European integration entails significant adjustments in a firm's marketing strategy. Despite the dismantling of legislative barriers, cultural milieu of the various member nations will continue to be an obstacle toward true integration. This study clusters 17 European nations on Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions. Three distinct clusters emerge, each with its unique cultural composition. Scrutinizing the cultural make-up of each cluster offers the possibility of selecting an appropriate marketing mix across nations belonging to the same cluster.",0
When Exporting Manufacturers Compete on the Basis of Service: Resources and Marketing Capabilities Driving Service Advantage and Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Because services account for an increasingly large percentage of the gross domestic product globally, achieving competitive advantage in the international markets depends to a great extent on the level of service the firm offers to its customers. Focusing on exporting manufacturers, this study draws from the resource-based view of the firm to develop and test a model of those key resources and capabilities that drive service advantage in the overseas markets. The author finds that exporting experience nurtures customer relationships and informational capabilities, and availability of finance facilitates informational and product development capabilities and enables exporters to achieve service advantage and superior venture performance in the overseas markets.",0
Which Competitive Advantage(s)? Competitive Advantage?Market Performance Relationships in International Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Business scholars and managers stress the importance of achieving and sustaining competitive advantage as a critical strategic step in enabling superior firm performance. Yet which types of competitive advantage may yield the best performance outcomes?and what contingency factors may affect this?remains largely unexplored. This article examines the contribution of price, product, and service advantages to market performance in international ventures. Applying customer value logic to the literature on value creation and value capture, the authors posit that the symmetric achievement of all pairs of advantages leads to increased market performance. The findings confirm this conjecture, while for the product?service advantage pairing, even asymmetry in achievement has a positive market performance effect when the asymmetry is toward service. Using primary data from a sample of U.K. manufacturing exporters, the authors find that price advantage has a direct positive effect on market performance, while the strong positive effect of service advantage is further strengthened (and the nonsignificant effect of product advantage becomes negative) when the distributor has high-quality relationships with the overseas customers and there is available production capacity, even in technologically turbulent environments.",0
Consumer Value-Maximizing Sweepstakes and Contests,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Sweepstakes and contests are some of the most frequently used promotional tools. Consumers participating in sweepstakes or contests have an opportunity to win prizes through a random draw. The authors examine how commonly used sweepstakes formats that vary in the number of winners and the allocation of the total reward money among the winners affect consumer valuations of the promotion. Given a fixed amount of reward money, the authors examine alternative reward formats based on the promotional objectives, consumer risk aversion, and degree of subadditivity. They test the analytical results using an experimental approach.",1
The Curse of Competitiveness: How Advice from Experienced Colleagues and Training Can Hurt Marketing Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The literature suggests that mangers are overly competitive and overemphasize competitors? payoffs in making decisions. The authors demonstrate how two seemingly innocuous but common decision inputs that mid- and entry-level managers use?(1) advice from colleagues and (2) training?could propagate this bias. The authors conduct an experiment in which one generation of participants plays a noncooperative game and then passes on advice on how to play the same game to the second generation. The authors find that the second generation is more likely to accept decisions that negatively impact the competitor's profits, even when those decisions result in lower payoffs. The results suggest that the advice of the first generation causes the second generation to be more sensitive to relative performance. In a second experiment, the authors show that training films that create negative feelings toward competitors can have adverse effects on managers? decisions. The training increases the willingness of managers to sacrifice own profits to reduce competitor profitability. These findings have important implications for managers in competitive markets. This research suggests that standard training materials that emphasize beating competitors should be carefully assessed for their unintentional but potentially damaging effects. In particular, training designed to evoke affective responses toward competitors must be used judiciously. Firms that give junior managers more autonomy and responsibility should also be cognizant that the advice these managers get and the information they share may propagate a competitive bias. To mitigate this problem, an option is to devote resources to better understand the content and nature of advice that managers share with one another.",0
When Should a Retailer Create an Exciting Store Environment?,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Addressing inconsistent results in the literature, the conceptual framework that the authors develop proposes that the consumer's motivational orientation moderates the effect of the arousal produced by a store environment on the pleasantness of the environment. Two experiments support the framework. When consumers have a recreational motivational orientation, high arousal has a positive effect on pleasantness, but when consumers have a task-oriented motivational orientation, high arousal decreases pleasantness. In addition, high arousal increases consumer intentions to visit and make purchases in the store for recreationally oriented consumers, but it has a negative impact on shopping behavior for task-oriented consumers. Pleasantness mediates the effect of arousal on shopping behavior.",0
Factor Analysis and Missing Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors study the estimation of factor models and the imputation of missing data and propose an approach that provides direct estimates of factor weights without the replacement of missing data with imputed values. First, the approach is useful in applications of factor analysis in the presence of missing data. Second, the proposed factor analysis model may be used as a vehicle for imputing missing data, producing a complete data set that can be analyzed subsequently with some other method. Here, the factor model itself is not of primary interest but presents a suitable model for purposes of imputation. The proposed method accommodates various patterns of missing data commonly found in marketing. The framework for factor analysis the authors develop deals with both discrete and continuous variables and gives rise to several models not considered previously. The authors illustrate various factor models on synthetic data, investigating their performance when missing data are present and when the distribution of the observed variables is incorrectly specified. The authors provide two empirical studies of the performance of the approach. In the first, the authors demonstrate how the proposed approach recovers the true (complete-data) factor structure in the presence of missing observations that occur because of item nonresponse and compare the procedure with three alternative methods traditionally used for handling missing data in factor analysis. In the second application, the factor model is used as a vehicle to impute data that are missing by design.",1
A Multi-Method Examination of Buyer-Seller Interactions among Japanese and American Businesspeople,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Edward T. Hall (1976) and others have told us that status and role are more important considerations in Japan than in the United States. Specifically addressed in this study is the moderating effect of culture on the relationships between negotiators? roles (buyer or seller) and their behaviors and outcomes. A laboratory negotiation simulation was conducted with more than 200 Japanese and American businesspeople as participants, and several of the simulated negotiations were videotaped for subsequent content and sociolinguistic analyses. The integration of findings supports Hall's notion that in Japan hierarchy is more important, and indeed, Japanese buyers receive greater deference from sellers.",0
A Cinderella Story: How Past Identity Salience Boosts Demand for Repurposed Products,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Like Cinderella, many repurposed products involve a biographical transformation, from a tattered past identity (e.g., an old airbag) to a product with a valuable but different new identity (e.g., a backpack made from an airbag). In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products? tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product?s past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products? biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.",0
"Washing Away Your Sins? Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Social Irresponsibility, and Firm Performance",Journal of Marketing,2016,"The authors address the questions of whether and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) relates to firm performance and, in so doing, identify four mechanisms pertaining to this relationship: (1) slack resources lead to CSR (i.e., slack resources mechanism) (2) CSR improves performance (i.e., good management mechanism), (3) CSR makes amends for past corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) (i.e., penance mechanism), and (4) CSR insures against subsequent CSI (i.e., insurance mechanism). Using an integrative approach, the authors incorporate the four mechanisms in their empirical model specification. Specifically, to model the interplay among CSR, CSI, and firm performance and to test the four mechanisms simultaneously, they propose a structural panel vector autoregression specification. In support of the good management mechanism, results from an unbalanced panel data set of more than 4,500 firms and up to 19 years suggest that firms that engage in CSR are likely to benefit financially from their CSR investments. Moreover, the authors do not find support for the slack resources or the insurance mechanism. In contrast, and in support of the penance mechanism, often firms' CSR seems to trail their CSI. However, the results also suggest that the penance mechanism is ineffective in offsetting negative performance effects due to CSI.",0
The Strategic Effects of Multimarket Contact: Mutual Forbearance and Competitive Response in the Personal Computer Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Firms frequently compete across multiple segments. Such multimarket contact has been shown to deter aggressive competition, leading to ?mutual forbearance.? Empirical support for this phenomenon derives mainly from studies on the direct effects of multimarket contact on a firm's decision variables. The analysis in this article extends the existing literature by empirically considering both the direct effects of multimarket contact (i.e., how it affects a firm's decision variables) and its strategic effects (i.e., how it affects a firm's reactions to its competitors' decision variables). The authors study the pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal computer industry. Consistent with prior research, the authors find that firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions. More important, the authors find strong strategic effects that are asymmetric; namely, firms respond to competitive attacks by introducing new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon. Thus, firms isolate any competitive retaliation to only a single marketing variable. The results offer a deeper understanding of the influence of multimarket contact on firm behavior.",1
Optimal Design for Multinomial Choice Experiments,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The author derives D-optimal designs for main-effects, multinomial choice experiments using attribute levels as design parameters. The design solutions are similar to standard main-effects designs except that one attribute is used to manipulate response probabilities. The manipulator is key to implementing optimal designs in practice.",1
The Unintended Consequence of Price-Based Service Recovery Incentives,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Subscription-based service providers (e.g., newspapers, internet services) often issue price-based incentives to recover from service failures. However, because considerable time may pass between when providers issue a recovery incentive and when service contracts are due for renewal, it is unclear whether recovery incentives can improve customer retention in the long run. The authors investigate this question by examining 6,919 contract renewal decisions of newspaper subscribers who received varying levels of recovery incentives after newspaper delivery failures. In contrast to conventional wisdom, they find that recovery incentives are associated with lower contract renewal likelihoods. They rationalize this finding using the economic theory of reference prices and further demonstrate that firms could mitigate the unintended consequence of recovery incentives by reminding subscribers of the original price at touch points following the recovery, discounting the renewal price, and prolonging the duration between the recovery and renewal. The authors also show that the intensity of promotions in the external environment at the time of administering recovery incentives, and that acquiring subscribers by communicating the value of the subscription service, can influence the long-term effectiveness of recovery incentives. For subscription-based service providers, the authors propose a decision support model to optimize recovery and renewal incentives and demonstrate its utility within this empirical context.",0
"Scheduling Content on Social Media: Theory, Evidence, and Application",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Content platforms (e.g., newspapers, magazines) post several stories daily on their dedicated social media pages and promote some of them using targeted content advertising (TCA). Posting stories enables content platforms to grow their social media audiences and generate digital advertising revenue from the impressions channeled through social media posts? link clicks. However, optimal scheduling of social media posts and TCA is formidable, requiring content platforms to determine what to post; when to post; and whether, when, and how much to spend on TCA to maximize profits. Social media managers lament this complexity, and academic literature offers little guidance. Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric. They test their hypotheses using a model estimated on 366 days of Facebook post data from a top 50 U.S. newspaper. Subsequently, they build an algorithm that allows social media managers to optimally plan social media content schedules and maximize gross profits. Applying the algorithm to a holdout sample, the authors demonstrate a potential increase in gross profits by at least 8%.",0
Optimizing a Menu of Multiformat Subscription Plans for Ad-Supported Media Platforms,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Media content distribution has changed extensively in the past decade. Content that was once distributed through traditional formats such as television, radio, and print is now available through contemporary digital formats such as smartphone and tablet apps, with many possible versions (e.g., presence or absence of ads). Consequently, many media firms that face heterogeneous markets of consumers with varying content consumption preferences are now offering ?menus? of multiformat and multiversion subscription bundles for their customers to choose from. Yet, little systematic model-based guidance exists for configuring and pricing menu options. Moreover, most media firms are audience-building platforms that serve at least two distinct customer groups (content consumers and advertisers) with interrelated demands. Therefore, constructing a menu of content subscription bundles that maximizes total profit from both consumers and advertisers is a formidable challenge. This research proposes a theory-driven implementable model-based approach that can aid media platforms in addressing this challenge. The proposed approach is then demonstrated for a U.S. newspaper, and insights into profit-maximizing menus under various business model and format strategies are provided.",0
Predicting the Consequences of Marketing Policy Changes: A New Data Enrichment Method with Competitive Reactions,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This article introduces a new data enrichment method that combines revealed data on consumer demand and competitive reactions with stated data on competitive reactions to yet-to-be-enacted, unprecedented marketing policy changes. The authors extend the data enrichment literature to include stated competitive reactions, collected from subject-matter experts through a conjoint experiment. The authors apply their method to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies. The results from the data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various unique insights compared with using revealed data only. The authors find that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well, leading to substantial profit increases for each firm. With respect to sales force allocation, when competitors decrease their sales force, they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors, rather than decreasing the number of details to the most-visited doctors. The proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool to, ex ante, predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy changes.",1
Marketing to Public- and Private-Sector Companies in Emerging Countries: A Study of Indian Purchasing Managers,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"Existing literature provides little guidance to international managers for selling to public- and private-sector companies in emerging countries. This research attempts to fill this gap using the context of India. The study focuses on the criteria used by industrial buyers to evaluate suppliers. Four hypotheses related to the differences in the importance placed on economic criteria, familiarity with the supplier, reliability of the supplier, and other capabilities of the supplier by purchasing managers from public- and private-sector companies in India are proposed and tested. Purchasing managers from private-sector organizations place more importance on economic criteria and other capabilities of the supplier than do purchasing managers from public-sector organizations. However, there is no difference in the importance placed on the reliability of the supplier by public- and private-sector purchasing managers. Also, no differences in the perception of familiarity as a supplier evaluation dimension are found. Specific recommendations are made on the basis of the findings that can aid managers in making marketing strategy decisions, including positioning, pricing, product, promotion, and distribution decisions. Finally, limitations of the study and extensions for further research are provided.",0
BYOB: How Bringing Your Own Shopping Bags Leads to Treating Yourself and the Environment,Journal of Marketing,2015,"As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags.",0
Cost Conscious? The Neural and Behavioral Impact of Price Primacy on Decision Making,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Price is a key factor in most purchases, but it can be presented at different stages of decision making. The authors examine the sequence-dependent effects of price and product information on the decision-making process at both neural and behavioral levels. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the price of a product was shown to participants either before or after the product itself was presented. Early exposure to price, or ?price primacy,? altered the process of valuation, as observed in altered patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex immediately before making a purchase decision. Specifically, whereas viewing products first resulted in evaluations strongly related to products? attractiveness or desirability, viewing prices first appeared to promote overall evaluations related to products? monetary worth. Consistent with this framework, the authors show that price primacy can increase purchase of bargain-priced products when their worth is easily recognized. Together, these results suggest that price primacy highlights considerations of product worth and can thereby influence purchasing.",1
Impact of Mad Money Stock Recommendations: Merging Financial and Marketing Perspectives,Journal of Marketing,2009,"This article relies on advertising and persuasive communications theories to uncover persistent variations in investor response to television stock recommendations targeting naive investors. The authors use an event study methodology to determine the size of the next-day abnormal market reaction to recommendations on Mad Money with Jim Cramer.Although viewers are actively looking for recommendations, the results show that any individual recommendation is still subject to many of the same communication challenges as traditional advertisements. A regression analysis finds that traditional advertising variables, such as message length, recency?primacy effects, information clutter, and source credibility, influence the size of the market reaction to a ?buy? recommendation. The authors discuss implications for marketers, managers of public companies, and those interested in public policy aspects related to televised stock recommendations.",0
Do Marketing Media Have Life Cycles? The Case of Product Placement in Movies,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This article examines the economic worth of product placement in movies over a time span of 40 years (1968?2007). The authors find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the year of the movie release and the returns associated with product placements. In addition, a similar inverted U-shaped relationship characterizes the economic worth of tie-in campaigns associated with product placements. These findings are consistent with the habituation?tedium theory used to explain the inverted U-shaped pattern in response to novel advertisements and suggest that the same mechanism could be influencing the response to an entire marketing medium. Overall, the results reinforce the notion that marketers find it increasingly difficult to get their message across using traditional media and underscore the need for the marketing industry to reinvent itself when new tactics lose their luster. The authors conclude with a discussion of additional empirical regularities.",0
Initiating and Maintaining Export Channel Intermediary Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Firms exporting via foreign channel intermediaries, such as import agents or distributors, trade off a lack of control of the foreign channel for a low-risk market entry. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis suggest that a lack of control manifests itself in the foreign channel intermediary (FCI) having opportunities to behave in its own interests, rather than those of the exporter. Even so, management strategies that result in an alignment of the exporter's and FCI's goals are more likely to result in a perception of satisfaction in the relationship than if only one party's goals were met. Such management strategies should commence with an extensive precontractual screening step to find an intermediary whose goals are complementary to those of the exporter. After forming a trading relationship, an exporter can better coordinate the relationship by noncoercive monitoring of the exporter, and reduce the potential for opportunistic behavior and achieve a relationship that performs to the satisfaction to both parties. Greater monitoring is also likely to maintain a state of goal congruence between the parties. Conditions of environmental uncertainty may, however, create difficulties in precontractual screening by the exporter. A conceptual framework explaining the interaction between these variables has been presented, along with nine testable propositions and directions for future research.",0
"Values that Shape Marketing Decisions: Influence of Chief Executive Officers? Political Ideologies on Innovation Propensity, Shareholder Value, and Risk",Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This research examines the influence of chief executive officers? (CEOs?) political ideologies?specifically, their degree of political liberalism (i.e., support for the Democratic Party relative to the Republican Party)?on firms? innovation propensity (i.e., rate of new product introductions [NPIs]). The authors propose that CEOs? degree of political liberalism positively affects their firms? rate of NPIs. This impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing department has high influence in the top management team, and when the economy is growing. Liberal CEOs? greater rate of NPIs is associated with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility. Findings based on observations of 421 publicly listed U.S. firms from 2006 to 2010 provide considerable support for the authors? hypotheses. The authors also examine changes in firms? rate of NPIs and performance around CEO turnovers and find corroborating evidence for their thesis. These results highlight the role of executives? personal values in shaping firms? innovation strategy as well as the risks and rewards associated with aggressive NPIs.",1
"Contracts, Extracontractual Incentives, and Ex Post Behavior in Franchise Channel Relationships",Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Grounded in agency theory, this study examines how franchisors' ex ante contracts and extracontractual incentives influence their ex post monitoring and enforcement efforts and how combinations of the ex post governance mechanisms drive franchisee behavior. Integrating three archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However, different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter franchisee compliance and opportunism.",1
The Joint Effects of Ex Ante Contractual Completeness and Ex Post Governance on Compliance in Franchised Marketing Channels,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This study examines the heretofore neglected joint effects of ex ante contractual completeness and ex post governance on compliance in a franchise setting. In contrast to much of the extant literature that views contractual completeness in the aggregate, the present research disaggregates contractual completeness into ex ante monitoring and enforcement completeness, and additionally distinguishes between ex post monitoring and enforcement, allowing for a nuanced examination of the joint effects of different types of ex ante and ex post governance on compliance. Additionally, the authors advance the concept of consummate compliance, thereby complementing the literature, which tends to view compliance solely in terms of perfunctory compliance?an important distinction because the results suggest that perfunctory compliance has a negative relationship with customer satisfaction, whereas consummate compliance has a positive one. Drawing on multiple data sources, the authors demonstrate that ex ante monitoring completeness positively moderates the relationship between ex post monitoring and both types of compliance; however, ex ante enforcement completeness negatively moderates the relationship between ex post enforcement and both types of compliance.",0
Network Effects and Personal Influences: The Diffusion of an Online Social Network,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article discusses the diffusion process in an online social network given the individual connections between members. The authors model the adoption decision of individuals as a binary choice affected by three factors: (1) the local network structure formed by already adopted neighbors, (2) the average characteristics of adopted neighbors (influencers), and (3) the characteristics of the potential adopters. Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors. An interesting counterintuitive finding is that the average influential power of individuals decreases with the total number of their contacts. These results have practical implications for viral marketing, a context in which a variety of technology platforms are increasingly considering leveraging their consumers' revealed connection patterns. The model performs particularly well in predicting the next set of adopters.",1
Export Market Expansion Strategies of Direct-Selling Small and Medium-Sized Firms: Implications for Export Sales Management Activities,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"The authors use punctuated equilibrium theory as a framework to help explain potential differences in the export sales management arrangements between firms that adopt an export market expansion strategy of either market concentration or market spreading. On the basis of a thorough review of the extant literature, the authors identify certain export sales managers? characteristics and behavior, export sales behavioral control, and satisfaction with export sales territory design as potential discriminators between these two groups of direct exporting firms. Consistent with the hypotheses, in general, the authors find that the tenets of punctuated equilibrium theory hold for the sample of small and medium-sized U.K. exporters. In addition, the results indicate that export market expansion strategy has important implications for a firm's export sales management arrangements. The authors discuss the findings and outline implications for business practitioners and further research.",0
Unpacking the Relationship between Sales Control and Salesperson Performance: A Regulatory Fit Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The literature examining the effect of sales control on salesperson performance is, at best, equivocal. To reconcile inconsistencies in empirical findings, this research introduces two new types of salesperson learning: exploratory and exploitative learning. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors conceptualize exploratory learning as promotion focused and exploitative learning as prevention focused and find that salespeople exhibit both exploratory and exploitative learning, though one is used more than the other depending on the type of sales control employed. The results also suggest that the fit between salesperson learning type, customer characteristics (i.e., purchase-decision-making complexity), and salesperson characteristics (i.e., preference for sales predictability) is critical to salesperson performance and that salesperson learning mediates the relationship between sales control and salesperson performance (Study 1). Study 2 corroborates the findings using new panel data collected over two waves. The results of this research have important implications for integrating sales control, salesperson learning, and salesperson performance.",0
Importing Problems Experienced by Distributors: The Importance of Level-of-Import Development,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"As opposed to the plethora of export-related studies, limited empirical work has been conducted on firms? import behavior in the field of international business. The focus of this study is an investigation of problems confronting UK importing distributor firms in their trading activities with U.S. exporting manufacturers. An attempt is made specifically to explore the existence of possible underlying import problem dimensions and examine potential differences in perceptions of importing problems based upon level of import development. The study identifies several significant differences in perceived import problems between different groups of firms in terms of their level of import development. The implications of the findings for importers, exporters, and public export policy markers are highlighted, and future research directions discussed alongside the limitations of the study.",0
Perceived Export Success Factors of Small and Medium-Sized Canadian Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"In drawing attention to certain important gaps in the export marketing literature, this paper reports on a systematic study of critical factors for export success of small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Canada. In this ethnocentric context, an attempt is made to investigate the presence of potentially significant differences in perceptions of key export success factors based upon export development, firm size, and product type. The study results point to the importance of the level of export development, product type and, to a lesser extent, company size in influencing exporter perceptions of factors contributing to export success. The implications of the findings for business practitioners and public policy makers are discussed, and avenues for future research outlined along with the limitations of the study.",0
Assessing Performance Outcomes in Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Research in marketing has increasingly focused on building knowledge about how firms? marketing contributes to performance outcomes. A key precursor to accurately diagnosing the value firms? marketing creates is conceptualizing and operationalizing appropriate ways to assess performance outcomes. Yet, to date, there has been little conceptual development and no systematic examination of how researchers in marketing should conceptualize and measure the performance outcomes associated with firms? marketing. The authors develop a theory-based performance evaluation framework and examine the assessment of such performance outcomes in 998 empirical studies published in the top 15 marketing journals from 1981 through 2014. The results reveal a large number of different performance outcome measures used in prior empirical research that may be only weakly related to one another, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. In addition, the authors identify significant problems in how performance outcomes in marketing are commonly conceptualized and operationalized. They also reveal several theoretically and managerially important performance areas in which empirical knowledge of marketing's impact is limited or absent. Finally, they examine the implications of the results, provide actionable guidelines for researchers, and suggest a road map for systematically improving research practice in the future.",0
Long-Term Export Stimuli and Firm Characteristics in a European LDC,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This study presents an investigation of factors that stimulate the decision-making process of exporting firms from a European Lesser Developed Country (LDC) to continue and sustain export activities. The paper explores the existence of dimensions underlying export motivation and identifies potentially significant differences in perceptions of export stimuli based on firm size, degree of export involvement, and exporting experience. The findings point to a more proactive (than reactive) motivation structure underlying the export activities of these manufacturers. While no relationship is found between perceptions of export motivation and firm size, a number of significant differences in ongoing export stimuli are identified between different groups of firms in terms of export involvement and, to a lesser extent, exporting experience. Managerial and public policy implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research directions are outlined.",0
The Role of Relational Embeddedness in Retail Buyers' Selection of New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Retailers face considerable risk in introducing new products because of high failure rates. Given the proliferation of new products juxtaposed against finite shelf space, retail buyers are confronted with a choice problem. To enhance understanding of this issue, the authors examine the role of buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships using data collected in the context of actual new product selection by retail buyers at two large grocery retailers in the United States. The findings indicate that buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships have a greater influence on new product acceptance when a new product's attractiveness is modest than when the new product is very unattractive or very attractive. At modest levels of product attractiveness, the likelihood of new product acceptance can increase by as much as 60% when the buyer has a strong relationship with the salesperson. The study provides insights into the complex interplay of marketing relationships and product attractiveness in retail buyers' selection of new products.",1
Internationalization Processes: The Case of Automotive Suppliers in China,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The article introduces a conceptual framework of internationalization processes and provides case study?based empirical insights. The aim is to analyze combinations of internationalization strategies and modes that automotive suppliers expanding into China have chosen and their evolution paths over time. In addition, the authors identify parameters that may explain why foreign entrants change their internationalization strategies and modes over time.",0
Constraints to Building and Deploying Marketing Capabilities by Emerging Market Firms in Advanced Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Firms can achieve a competitive advantage across different institutional environments by building and deploying marketing capabilities (MCs)?that is, their ability to sense and meet customers? demands. However, internationalizing emerging markets firm have preferred different sources of competitive advantage thus far. Drawing from marketing research and the resource-based view of the firm, this article investigates the antecedents for building and deploying MCs by Chinese firms in Europe. Using a qualitative research approach, the authors find that deficiencies in motivation, opportunity, and ability constrain these firms from shifting to more marketing-driven business models. The authors also identify the underlying reasons for each of these antecedents, including causal ambiguity and inertia. The derived theoretical framework specifies the constraining effects of different levels of motivation, opportunity, and ability on the building and deployment of MCs in firms from emerging markets as they evolve from one stage of international marketing to another.",0
Customer Reactions to Service Separation,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Recent research suggests that inseparability is not a universal distinguishing characteristic of services and that the consumption of many services is or can be separated from their production. This research defines service separation as customers? absence from service production, which denotes the spatial separation between service production and consumption. In a series of qualitative and quantitative studies across different services, the authors examine customer reactions to service separation. The results indicate that service separation increases customers? perceptions of not only access convenience and benefit convenience but also performance risk and psychological risk. Furthermore, these effects differ across services. Specifically, relative to experience services, for credence services, the effects of separation on service convenience are mitigated, and the effects on perceived risk are magnified. Subsequently, the convenience and risk perceptions induced by service separation can influence customers? purchase decisions and postexperience evaluations. Customers prefer separation for experience services and when they have an established relationship with the service provider. Finally, the authors discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications and offer directions for further research.",0
The Complexities of Perceived Risk in Cross-Cultural Services Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Previous research has found that cultural differences influence consumer risk evaluation. From a cross-national perspective, the authors explore the individual and cultural causes, as well as the consequences, of postpurchase personal and nonpersonal risks for a credence service (i.e., insurance). Using survey data from 309 Chinese consumers and 193 Singaporean consumers, the authors find that two cultural dimensions (self-transcendence/self-enhancement versus conservation/openness to change) and individual contextual factors (involvement and face consciousness) exert differential effects on consumer perceived risk in the two countries. In addition, the authors find that personal and nonpersonal risks have varying levels of impact on perceived value and customer satisfaction in the two countries.",0
NATID: The Development and Application of a National Identity Measure for Use in International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"The international marketing literature abounds with studies outlining the various similarities and differences that exist across cultural and national boundaries (e.g. Hofstede 1980). Unfortunately, many of these studies have focused on descriptive comparisons between cultures and nations.This article develops a measurement instrument designed to explicate the degree to which national identity can be specified and the differences between that national identity and other nations. Utilizing Churchill's (1979), and Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) guidelines for scale construction and application, this article develops an instrument to measure national identity and establishes norms for its usage, using samples from the United States, Japan, and Sweden. The overall objective of this study is threefold: 1) to develop an empirically sound instrument for measuring national identity; 2) to explore the importance placed on a unique national identity in the three nations comprising the sample; and 3) to consider differences in the underlying dimensions comprising these countries? national identity and their impact on marketing strategy. The development of such a measurement instrument should provide a means by which the results of cross-cultural and cross-national research can be empirically tested and on which more rigorous theory building can be based.",0
A Study of the Service Encounter in Eight Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"Drawing on the theory developed by the Nordic school of service marketing, the authors devise a model that involves the direct effects of technical (physical good quality) and functional (service quality and servicescape) elements of the service encounter on customers? behavioral intentions. They test the model using service customers in the fast-food and grocery industries in eight countries (Australia, China, Germany, India, Morocco, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States). Notable differences exist between fast-food and grocery customers in the eight countries. The relative effects of the technical and functional service elements on behavioral intentions also differ significantly across countries.",0
Remedying Hyperopia: The Effects of Self-Control Regret on Consumer Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The self-control literature is premised on the notion of myopia (shortsightedness or present-biased preferences) and assumes that choosing vices generates regret. An alternative perspective suggests that consumers often suffer from a reverse self-control problem?namely, excessive farsightedness and overcontrol, or ?hyperopia.? This research examines whether consumers can foresee the detrimental long-term consequences of hyperopia. Five studies demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret relaxes self-control and motivates consumers to counteract their righteousness. Consumers are more likely to select indulgences and luxuries when they judge the longer-term regrets of others, anticipate their own regret in the distant future, and reflect on their regret regarding an actual decision made in the more distant past. The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping mall and during Thanksgiving. These experiments demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret leads consumers to buy pleasurable products rather than practical necessities and to spend more on shopping. The implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.",1
A Longitudinal Examination of Net Promoter and Firm Revenue Growth,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Managers have widely embraced and adopted the Net Promoter metric, which noted loyalty consultant Frederick Reichheld advocates as the single most reliable indicator of firm growth compared with other loyalty metrics, such as customer satisfaction and retention. Recently, however, there has been considerable debate about whether this metric is truly superior. This article (1) employs longitudinal data from 21 firms and 15,500-plus interviews from the Norwegian Customer Satisfaction Barometer to replicate the analyses used in Net Promoter research and (2) compares Reichheld and colleagues' findings with the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Using industries Reichheld cites as exemplars of Net Promoter, the research fails to replicate his assertions regarding the ?clear superiority? of Net Promoter compared with other measures in those industries.",0
Let Your Banner Wave? Antecedents and Performance Implications of Retailers? Private-Label Branding Strategies,Journal of Marketing,2016,"The authors study the drivers and performance implications of retailers? branding strategies for their premium and economy private-label tiers. Retailers can opt for store-banner branding and use their store-banner name and/or logo to reveal their ownership, or they can use stand-alone branding and avoid an explicit link between store brand and retail banner. Hypotheses are tested on a large pan-European sample of premium and economy tiers that were introduced over almost 15 years. For the premium tier, retailers? propensity to use store-banner branding is higher when they have a hi?lo price format and a higher brand equity, and when they have used store-banner branding in the past (on their standard tier and in other markets). The attractiveness of using store-banner branding for the premium tier also varies across countries: it is more likely to be chosen when the retail environment is less concentrated, when uncertainty avoidance and rule of law are higher, and when power distance is lower. For most of these drivers, the effect is significantly weaker for the economy tier. Retailers whose premium-tier branding decision is congruent with the proposed contingency framework perform better. For the economy tier, congruence is not associated with higher performance.",0
Opening the Umbrella: The Effects of Rebranding Multiple Category-Specific Private-Label Brands to One Umbrella Brand,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors study the consequences of rebranding multiple category-specific private-label (PL) brands by ?opening the umbrella? and unifying them under a common brand name. Retailers expect positive consequences that may manifest themselves in two ways: (1) an increased intrinsic brand strength and (2) an improved marketing-mix effectiveness. The authors analyze three substantially different retailers that rebranded one of their PL tiers. Consistent with the national-brand literature on umbrella rebranding, all three retailers realized an increase in the rebranded PL tier?s intrinsic brand strength, along with a reduced price elasticity. However, and in contrast to the national-brand literature, the effectiveness of both price-promoting and assortment size dropped for all three retailers after they unified their category-specific PLs under a common umbrella name.",1
"Affect, Framing, and Persuasion",Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The authors conduct two experiments that indicate that the effectiveness of loss- versus gain-framed messages depends on the affective state of the message recipient. In Experiment 1, the authors find that participants induced with a positive mood are more persuaded by the loss-framed message, whereas participants induced with a negative mood are more persuaded by the gain-framed message. In addition, the authors observe that participants in a positive mood have higher risk estimates and lower costs in response to the loss frame than the gain frame, whereas the reverse is true for participants in a negative mood. The authors replicate these effects in Experiment 2 in which they measure rather than induce the participants' affective state.",1
Price Promotions and Popular Events,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Managers often use popular events, such as the Olympics, to advertise their brands more heavily. Can manufacturers and retailers capitalize on these events to enhance the response to their price promotions? This study empirically examines whether the sales response to price promotions is stronger or weaker around events than at nonevent times, and what factors drive this relative promotion response. Studying 242 brands from 30 consumer packaged goods categories in the Netherlands over more than four years, the authors find that a price promotion offered around a popular event often generates a stronger sales response than the same promotion at nonevent times, with a price promotion elasticity that is 9.3% larger, on average, during events. Still, the variance in relative promotion response across brands and events is high, and the authors identify several drivers that managers should consider before shifting promotions toward event times. Currently, managers often do not take these drivers into account. This study provides guidelines to improve promotional timing decisions in relation to popular events.",0
How Top Management's Social Capital Fosters the Development of Specialized Marketing Capabilities: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"The main purpose of this research is to investigate the role of top management's social capital as a microlevel origin of four specialized marketing capabilities: pricing, product development, distribution, and marketing communication. The authors investigate the moderating effect of national culture on the link between social capital and marketing capability using survey data from 891 firms across four countries (China, Germany, Hong Kong, and the United States). The findings indicate that the elements of social capital?managerial tie utilization, trust, and solidarity?are strong drivers of the four marketing capabilities. Managerial tie utilization and solidarity tend to be more important when national culture's power distance is low, collectivism is high, and uncertainty avoidance is low, whereas the effect of trust is not subject to national cultural variations. From a managerial perspective, this research emphasizes the strong role and responsibility of top management team members, including marketing managers who are at this level, in building organization-level marketing capabilities.",0
Implementing a Customer Orientation: Extension of Theory and Application,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The marketing literature affirms the value of a customer orientation to organizational performance, but it is relatively silent on the implementation of this orientation. This research reports the results of a paired-comparison ethnographic study of the dynamics of implementing a customer orientation in a major public school district. Changes at a progressing site are compared with those at a struggling site. The study provides answers to the question of how an organization adopts a customer orientation by refining understanding of the roles of leadership, interfunctional coordination, and the collection and dissemination of customer-focused data in the transformation process.",0
A Comparison of Criteria to Design Efficient Choice Experiments,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"To date, no attempt has been made to design efficient choice experiments by means of the G- and V-optimality criteria. These criteria are known to make precise response predictions, which is exactly what choice experiments aim to do. In this article, the authors elaborate on the G- and V-optimality criteria for the multinomial logit model and compare their prediction performances with those of the D- and A-optimality criteria. They make use of Bayesian design methods that integrate the optimality criteria over a prior distribution of likely parameter values. They employ a modified Fedorov algorithm to generate the optimal choice designs. They also discuss other aspects of the designs, such as level overlap, utility balance, estimation performance, and computational effectiveness.",1
An Empirical Analysis of Price Discrimination Mechanisms and Retailer Profitability,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Retailers typically engage in some form of price discrimination to increase profitability. In this article, the authors compare the impact on retailer profitability of two price discrimination mechanisms: quantity discounts based on package size (second-degree price discrimination) and store-level pricing or micromarketing (third-degree price discrimination). Whereas the latter has been well addressed in the marketing literature, there is limited empirical research on the use of quantity discounts for price discrimination. Using store-level sales data, the authors estimate a structural demand model, accounting for parameter heterogeneity and price endogeneity. They combine the parameter estimates with a model of retailer pricing to conduct optimal pricing and profitability simulations under several scenarios, ranging from constraining the retailer not to engage in any form of price discrimination to the least restrictive scenario of setting nonlinear price schedules specific to each store. The pricing simulations enable the decomposition of profitability as a result of the different forms of price discrimination. Profits are greatest when retailers combine second- and third-degree price discrimination. The authors find that the ability to engage in second-degree price discrimination contributes more to retailer profitability than does third-degree price discrimination.",1
Licensing Effect in Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Most choices in the real world follow other choices or judgments. The authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation. The authors also report a mediation analysis in support of their theoretical explanation that the licensing effect operates by providing a temporary boost in the relevant self-concept.",1
Price-Framing Effects on the Purchase of Hedonic and Utilitarian Bundles,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Marketers are increasingly offering bundles that combine cross-category, seemingly unrelated items. This article examines the conditions under which framing a discount as savings on certain items of cross-category bundles is more effective for increasing bundle purchase. Three experiments show that the purchase of a cross-category bundle is more likely when the discount is framed as savings on the relatively hedonic component rather than as savings on the utilitarian component or on the total bundle. The authors explain the findings based on the notion that a discount provides a justification that increases the likelihood of hedonic purchases but has little impact on utilitarian consumption. The article concludes with a discussion of managerial implications of the findings.",1
When Trade-Offs Matter: The Effect of Choice Construal on Context Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Everyday decisions present consumers with several trade-offs. In turn, these trade-offs can influence the decision outcome. The authors show that the level at which people construe a choice can affect trade-off making, such that a high construal of a choice decreases comparative trade-offs relative to a low construal. They use six studies to illustrate the idea in three important trade-off-relevant context effects. The results show that a high (versus a low) construal decreases the compromise and background-contrast effects and increases the attraction effect by reducing attribute-level trade-offs.",1
Going Global with Innovations from Emerging Economies: Investment in Customer Support Capabilities Pays Off,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Globalization of innovation calls for entrepreneurial new ventures from emerging economies to develop customer-focused dynamic capabilities. The authors argue that firms with proprietary technology and a strategic intent to internationalize invest in international customer support capabilities to satisfy the demands of their most important international customers. Using a unique sample of 173 international new ventures from China and India, the authors show that such investments are associated with improved organizational learning and performance. The results suggest that globalization pays off when entrepreneurial firms from emerging economies invest in ongoing support of their most important international customers.",0
Developing Donor Relationships: The Role of the Breadth of Giving,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This research proposes a mechanism to develop long-term donor relationships, a major challenge in the nonprofit industry. The authors propose a metric, donation variety, which captures a donor's breadth of donations with a given nonprofit organization, controlling for the distribution of donations to different initiatives. Using donation data spanning 20 years from a major U.S. public university, the authors find that improvements in donation variety increase the likelihood that the donor will make a subsequent donation, increase the donation amount, and reduce the sensitivity of donations to negative macroeconomic shocks. In the acquisition phase, most donors give to a single initiative, and these decisions are more influenced by a donor's intrinsic motivations. In contrast, as the donor?nonprofit organization relationship develops over time, nonprofit marketing efforts have a more significant influence on a donor's decision to give to multiple initiatives. Finally, the authors conduct a field study that validates the econometric analysis and provides causal evidence that marketing efforts by nonprofit organizations can encourage donors to spread donations across multiple initiatives.",0
Emotional Intelligence in Marketing Exchanges,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves, and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents, even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange variables?customer orientation and manifest influence?to heighten performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and training.",0
Emotional Ability Training and Mindful Eating,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Consumers are often mindless eaters. This research provides a framework for how consumers can become more mindful of their food choices. To do so, the authors develop an ability-based training program to strengthen people's ability to focus on goal-relevant emotional information. They demonstrate not only that emotional ability (EA) is trainable and that food choices can be enhanced (Study 1) but also that EA training improves food choices beyond a nutrition knowledge training program (Study 2). In Study 3, the authors test a conceptual model and find that EA training increases goal-relevant emotional thoughts and reduces reliance on the unhealthy = tasty intuition. Both factors mediate mindful eating effects. Last, Study 4 demonstrates the long-term benefits of EA training by showing that emotionally trained people lose more weight in a three-month period than a control group and a nutrition knowledge training group. Together, these findings suggest that consumers can gain control of their food choices through the enhancement of EA. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for policy officials, health care professionals, and marketers.",1
The Global Research-and-Development Network and Its Effect on Innovation,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"The authors examine the impact of a firm's innovation by analyzing its position in a global research-and-development network and its orientation toward using scientific knowledge (science intensity). Drawing on organizational learning and network theory research, they focus on the moderating role of a firm's network position in the relationship between the firm's science intensity and the impact of its innovation. Data derived from the global pharmaceutical industry indicate that a firm's science intensity enhances the impact of its innovation by facilitating effective search. This relationship is reinforced when the firm has network resources derived from an efficient network position. These results support the idea that the impact of innovation is strengthened when internal research capability and external network resources are combined. This study, which is conducted in a global industry network context, also enables the authors to examine the role of international gatekeepers in bridging ties across U.S., Japanese, and European geographic boundaries.",0
How Variety-Seeking versus Inertial Tendency Influences the Effectiveness of Immediate versus Delayed Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Four studies investigate (1) whether a variety-seeking versus inertial environment activates a certain mind-set about risk propensity and (2) whether this mind-set influences preferences for immediate versus delayed promotions. Study 1 demonstrates that a variety-seeking environment activates a risk-taking mind-set, whereas an inertial environment activates a risk-averse mind-set and that such a difference in risk propensity makes a delayed (immediate) promotion relatively more appealing for consumers with a variety-seeking (inertial) tendency. Study 2 reveals that preferences for a brand offering a delayed promotion are stronger when consumers have a variety-seeking tendency and that preferences of consumers low (vs. high) in need for cognitive closure are more influenced by the difference in variety-seeking versus inertial tendency. Study 3 provides further insights by allowing participants to be variety seeking or inertial and by controlling for redemption effort and the hedonic/utilitarian aspects of categories. Finally, Study 4 highlights the impact of variety-seeking versus inertial tendency on real-world choices. The article concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.",1
PIE: A Holistic Preference Concept and Measurement Model,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Extant preference measurement research, including conjoint analysis, has been silent on the explicit influence of others in the formation of consumer preferences. This article proposes a new holistic framework of preference, ?PIE,? as well as a measurement method to remedy this problem. The new paradigm posits that consumers evaluate products on the basis of different ?needs? determined by three sources: (1) P, the physical attributes of the product; (2) I, the individual characteristics of the choice maker; and (3) E, characteristics of an external peer group. To provide an empirically feasible method to capture all three sources of information, the authors propose and test an incentive-aligned approach, a ?group-sourced mechanism,? which mimics a consumer's real-life consultation in the presence of his or her friends when making a purchase decision. The results provide support for the PIE framework, including superior predictive performance in a conjoint task that is ?stacked against it.? The authors also show how firms can apply the PIE framework for product design. Practitioners, however, must carefully weigh the benefits of the group-sourced preference measurement with the heavier cognitive burden on the respondents in completing the task.",1
How Kinetic Property Shapes Novelty Perceptions,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This article demonstrates a new substantive finding: that kinetic property in advertising, defined as direction changes in the paths of moving on-screen ad elements, enhances consumer judgments of product novelty. Across six studies, the authors first outline an inference-based theory as to why the novelty-enhancing effect of kinetic property manifests: kinetic property generates impressions of how visually lively an ad is, which leads to inferences of product atypicality and, consequently, higher novelty judgments. Second, they demonstrate boundary conditions by showing that (1) the positive effect for kinetic property is evident with incremental (and not radical) innovations, (2) the effect dissipates when figure-ground contrast in the ad makes kinetic property less discriminable, (3) contextual adaptation to kinetic property can mitigate this effect, and (4) kinetic property enhances novelty judgments primarily when product category characteristics such as perceived market dynamism match with kinetic property?based executions. The authors offer substantive implications for firms marketing new products as well as for multimedia advertising.",0
More or Less: A Model and Empirical Evidence on Preferences for Under- and Overpayment in Trade-In Transactions,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments.",1
Pay what you Want: A New Participative Pricing Mechanism,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Pay what you want (PWYW) is a new participative pricing mechanism in which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay. Previous research has suggested that participative pricing increases consumers? intent to purchase. However, sellers using PWYW face the risk that consumers will exploit their control and pay nothing at all or a price below the seller's costs. In three field studies, the authors find that prices paid are significantly greater than zero. They analyze factors that influence prices paid and show that PWYW can even lead to an increase in seller revenues.",0
Mapping Online Consumer Search,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors propose a new method to visualize browsing behavior in so-called product search maps. Manufacturers can use these maps to understand how consumers search for competing products before choice, including how information acquisition and product search are organized along brands, product attributes, and price-related search strategies. The product search maps also inform manufacturers about the competitive structure in the industry and the contents of consumer consideration sets. The proposed method defines a product search network, consisting of the products and links that designate whether a product is searched conditional on searching other products. The authors model this network using a stochastic, hierarchical, and asymmetric multidimensional scaling framework and decompose the product locations as well as the product-level influences using product attributes. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the authors simultaneously visualize the positions of products and the direction of consumer search over products in a perceptual map of search proximity. Second, they explain the formation of the map using observed product attributes. The authors empirically apply their approach to consumer search of digital camcorders at Amazon.com and provide several managerial implications.",1
How Consumers? Political Ideology and Status-Maintenance Goals Interact to Shape Their Desire for Luxury Goods,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This research distinguishes between the goal of maintaining status and advancing status and investigates how consumers? political ideology triggers sensitivity to a status-maintenance (vs. status-advancement) goal, subsequently altering luxury consumption. Because conservative political ideology increases the preference for social stability, the authors propose that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more sensitive to status maintenance (but not status advancement) and thus exhibit a greater desire for luxury goods when the status-maintenance goal is activated. Six studies assessing status maintenance using sociodemographic characteristics (Studies 1, 2, and 3a) and controlled manipulations, including ad framing (Study 3b) and semantic priming (Studies 4 and 5), provide support for this proposition. The studies show that the effect is specific to status maintenance and does not occur (1) in the absence of a status goal or (2) when the status-advancement goal (a focus on increasing status) is activated. Overall, the findings reveal that conservatives? desire for luxury goods stems from the goal of maintaining status and offer insights into how luxury brands can effectively tailor their communications to audiences with a conservative ideology.",0
National Culture and Advertising Sensitivity to Business Cycles: A Reexamination,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"The author reexamines the cyclical sensitivity of national advertising expenditure with a longitudinal data set of 59 countries over 35 years. In contrast to prior studies, the author examines the effects of the entire set of Hofstede culture dimensions to study cross-country variation in the advertising sensitivity and investigates how the emergence and growth of online advertising has transformed the cyclical sensitivity of advertising spending. National culture substantially affects advertising?s cyclical sensitivity, but in different ways than hypothesized previously. Consistent with the literature, advertising sensitivity is lower in long-term-oriented and high-uncertainty-avoidant countries and is unrelated to individualism. However, power distance is unassociated with cyclical sensitivity, and masculinity and indulgence?the two dimensions ignored in previous research?reduce cyclical sensitivity. Moreover, there is evidence that culture operates differently for the cyclical sensitivity of online advertising. Advertising expenditure is cyclically much more sensitive than documented previously and has grown more so over time since the advent of online advertising. This study provides initial evidence that online spending is more elastic than traditional advertising and that traditional spending has become more procyclical. The author advances timely and refined empirical generalizations on the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditure.",0
On Distributor Commitment in Marketing Channels for Industrial Products: Contrast between the United States and Japan,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Previous studies have highlighted task environmental factors as the sole drivers of a distributor's commitment to its supplier and have found positive consequences of distributor commitment. The authors propose institutional factors as another motive for distributor commitment in channel relationships. Specifically, the authors suggest that long-term orientation is an essential institutional environment to consider for a comparative study of distributor commitment. The authors hypothesize that distributor commitment is driven by both task environmental factors and institutional factors. The authors conduct national surveys of industrial distributors in the United States and Japan to test the hypotheses. The hypothesis test results indicate that task environmental factors are related significantly to distributor commitment regardless of the channel contexts and that the effect of an institutional factor varies across the channel contexts.",0
The Relative Influence of Economic and Relational Direct Marketing Communications on Buying Behavior in Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Business-to-business firms spend significant resources in direct marketing to manage close relationships with their customers. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of how the effectiveness of direct marketing communications varies by value propositions. Typically, direct marketing efforts are geared toward explicitly featuring economic or relational values. To implement an effective communication strategy catering to customers' preferences, firms should understand how customers consistently evaluate these organizational marketing communications, which ultimately affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1) effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using transaction data. Overall, the authors provide a marketing resource reallocation strategy that enables marketers to customize marketing communications and improve a firm's financial performance.",1
"Stock Market Reaction to Unexpected Growth in Marketing Expenditure: Negative for Sales Force, Contingent on Spending Level for Advertising",Journal of Marketing,2011,"Because firms do not publicly report marketing expenditures, most studies of the link between firm value and marketing consider advertising (which is publicly reported for many firms) a proxy for marketing. The authors extend those studies in two ways. First, they broaden the proxy for marketing by considering both advertising and sales force. Second, they offer an explanation for the fact that some studies linking advertising to firm value find a positive relationship, whereas others find a negative relationship. The accounting literature suggests that the link to firm value for both unexpected growth in sales force expenditures and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures should be negative. The authors confirm the hypothesized accounting relationship for sales force expenditures but find a contingent relationship for advertising expenditures. Firm value and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures are negatively related for firms that advertise below the advertising response threshold, but they are positively related for firms that advertise above that threshold. Perhaps because this contingent relationship is difficult for analysts to learn through observation of the stock market, analysts ignore value-relevant advertising expenditure information when they forecast firm value.",0
When Salespeople Manage Customer Relationships: Multidimensional Incentives and Private Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"At many firms, incentivized salespeople with private information about customers are responsible for customer relationship management. Although incentives motivate sales performance, private information can induce moral hazard by salespeople to gain compensation at the expense of the firm. The authors investigate the sales performance?moral hazard trade-off in response to multidimensional performance (acquisition and maintenance) incentives in the presence of private information. Using unique panel data on customer loan acquisition and repayments linked to salespeople from a microfinance bank, the authors detect evidence of salesperson private information. Acquisition incentives induce salesperson moral hazard, leading to adverse customer selection, but maintenance incentives moderate it as salespeople recognize the negative effects of acquiring low-quality customers on future payoffs. Critically, without the moderating effect of maintenance incentives, the adverse selection effect of acquisition incentives overwhelms the sales-enhancing effects, clarifying the importance of multidimensional incentives for customer relationship management. Reducing private information (through job transfers) hurts customer maintenance but has greater impact on productivity by moderating adverse selection at acquisition. This article also contributes to the recent literature on detecting and disentangling customer adverse selection and customer moral hazard (defaults) with a new identification strategy that exploits the time-varying effects of salesperson incentives.",1
The Influence of Global Brand Distribution on Brand Popularity on Social Media,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"The literature on consumer choice between global and local brands is focused on sales-based measures of brand globalness (BG). When managers need to establish an effective social media campaign to raise awareness of their brands? activities on social media, the literature focus may not provide clear guidance on how such measures can be applied to social media. This research contributes to global brand research by combining the literature streams on consumer social media engagement and global branding marketing strategies. First, to provide a managerial tool for this task, the authors propose two novel measures, BG and country brand popularity (CBP), based on consumers? brand activities on social media. Using these measures, the authors hypothesize that CBP is influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors, which is motivated by motivation?opportunity?ability theory. Using Facebook data covering the top 100 brands that operate across 50 countries in each of 51 industries, they show that CBP is influenced by BG and cultural, social, and economic characteristics.",0
"Implementing Managerial Constraints in Model-Based Segmentation: Extensions of Kim, Fong, and DeSarbo (2012) with an Application to Heterogeneous Perceptions of Service Quality",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Researchers have recently introduced a finite mixture Bayesian regression model to simultaneously identify consumer market segments (heterogeneity) and determine how such segments differ with respect to active regression coefficients (variable selection). This article introduces three extensions of this model to incorporate managerial restrictions (constraints). The authors demonstrate with synthetic data that the new constrained finite mixture Bayesian regression models can be used to identify and represent several constrained heterogeneous response patterns commonly encountered in practice. In addition, they show that the proposed models are more robust against multicollinearity than traditional methods. Finally, to illustrate the proposed models' usefulness, the authors apply the proposed constrained models in the context of a service quality (SERVPERF) survey of National Insurance Company's customers.",1
Model-Based Segmentation Featuring Simultaneous Segment-Level Variable Selection,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors propose a new Bayesian latent structure regression model with variable selection to solve various commonly encountered marketing problems related to market segmentation and heterogeneity. The proposed procedure simultaneously performs segmentation and regression analysis within the derived segments, in addition to determining the optimal subset of independent variables per derived segment. The authors present comparative analyses contrasting the performance of the proposed methodology against standard latent class regression and traditional Bayesian finite mixture regression. They demonstrate that their proposed Bayesian model compares favorably with these traditional benchmark models. They then present an actual commercial customer satisfaction study performed for an electric utility company in the southeastern United States, in which they examine the heterogeneous drivers of perceived quality. Finally, they discuss limitations of the research and provide several directions for further research.",1
Bayesian Synthetic Control Methods,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors propose a new Bayesian synthetic control framework to overcome limitations of extant synthetic control methods (SCMs). The proposed Bayesian synthetic control methods (BSCMs) do not impose any restrictive constraints on the parameter space a priori. Moreover, they provide statistical inference in a straightforward manner as well as a natural mechanism to deal with the ?large p, small n? and sparsity problems through Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Using simulations, the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an increase of 5.7% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5%?5.8% in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121%.",1
Interdependence and Its Consequences in Distributor-Supplier Relationships: A Distributor Perspective through Response Surface Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Despite its importance for marketing channels research, the effect of interdependence on channel outcome variables remains elusive because of the inconsistent manner in which it is operationalized and the analytical methods used to assess its impact. To address those gaps, the authors first review prior approaches and identify the sources of their limitations. Then, the authors use the response surface approach (RSA) and derive three managerial insights that can be garnered from its use. They apply RSA to industrial distributor-supplier relationships and contrast it with previous methods. The empirical study results suggest that distributors perceive differential effects of supplier dependence and distributor dependence on outcome variables. The authors elaborate on managerial and research implications of the RSA results.",1
Understanding Governance Decisions in a Partially Integrated Channel: A Contingent Alignment Framework,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article examines governance decisions within an emerging and increasingly common form of channel: the partially integrated channel (PIC). The PIC is defined as a single vertical channel in which both market governance and hierarchical governance exist (i.e., the employees of one channel member work on a full-time basis at an exchange partner's facilities, performing functions that the exchange partner traditionally performs). Building on the transaction cost analysis and governance value analysis literature streams, the authors examine ongoing governance decisions within the PIC. Data were collected in the fashion apparel market of South Korea using multisource, reciprocally matched data in which a manufacturer's directly employed sales force is deployed at department store retailers as the sole frontline employees for their brand. The authors find that brand reputation, downstream market uncertainty, and sales force performance ambiguity influence manufacturer control over sales operations and manufacturer flexibility with retailers in unique ways. The authors discuss implications of this work for theory and practice.",1
Product Concept Demonstrations in Trade Shows and Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Trade shows are a popular venue for firms to demonstrate their portfolio of market-ready new products as well as product concepts under different stages of development. Utilizing auto shows as a context, the authors investigate the effects of concept and product demonstrations on the demonstrating firm's value. Event study results show that abnormal returns follow an inverted U-shaped effect of product development stages: that is, previously demonstrated concepts approaching potential launch have the strongest positive effect, followed by early-stage concepts demonstrated for the first time to the world (i.e., debuts), and then market-ready new products. Trade show locations mediate these effects. The effects of early-stage debut demonstrations appear only when concepts are presented in trade shows located in the home country of the demonstrating firm. However, the effects of displaying previously demonstrated concepts, which have survived product development hurdles, are present in venues within as well as outside the firm's home country.",0
Can Viagra Advertising Make More Babies? Direct-to-Consumer Advertising on Public Health Outcomes,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Although product advertising has been widely studied and understood in relation to the consumer?s purchase decision, advertising may also have unintended but important societal and economic consequences. In this article, the authors examine a public health outcome?birth rate?associated with advertisements for erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs. Since the United States loosened regulations on direct-to-consumer television advertising for prescription drugs in 1997, ED drug makers have consistently been top spenders. By comparing advertising data with multiple birth data sets (patient-level hospital data from Massachusetts between 2001 and 2010 and micro birth certificate data from the United States between 2000 and 2004), the authors demonstrate that increased ED drug television advertising leads to a higher birth rate. Their results, which are robust with respect to different functional forms and falsification tests, show that a 1% increase in ED drug advertising contributes to an increase of .04%?.08% of total births. Their findings suggest that beyond the customer purchase decision, advertising can have important public health outcomes, with resulting implications for managerial decision making and policy formulation.",1
The Sources and Consequences of the Fluent Processing of Numbers,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Consumers often like fluently processed stimuli. The authors find that one source of fluency for numerical stimuli is the generation of a number through common addition (e.g., 1 + 1 through 10 + 10) and common multiplication (2 ? 2 through 10 ? 10) problems (study 1). Common addition and multiplication problems (arithmetic), or their operands, can be used to prime a number and increase its fluency (study 3). The benefits of arithmetic and operand primes are limited to single primes (i.e., more primes are not necessarily better) (Study 5). Number fluency is relevant to creating numeric brand names (Study 2), enhancing the liking of numeric brand names through advertising (Study 4), and executing price promotions (Study 6).",1
Market Orientation: A Meta-Analytic Review and Assessment of its Antecedents and Impact on Performance,Journal of Marketing,2005,"The authors conduct a meta-analysis that aggregates empirical findings from the market orientation literature. First, the study provides a quantitative summary of the bivariate findings regarding the antecedents and the consequences of market orientation. Second, the authors use multivariate analyses of aggregate study effects to identify significant antecedents of market orientation and the process variables that mediate the relationship between market orientation and performance. In addition, using regression analysis, the authors find that the market orientation?performance relationship is stronger in samples of manufacturing firms, in low power-distance and uncertainty-avoidance cultures, and in studies that use subjective measures of performance. The authors also find that the market orientation?performance correlation is stronger for both cost-based and revenue-based performance measures in manufacturing firms than in service firms. On the basis of the findings, the authors conclude with a discussion of the implications for practice and further research.",0
Doing Well versus Doing Good: The Differential Effect of Underdog Positioning on Moral and Competent Service Providers,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This research examines how consumers make trade-offs between highly competent, less moral service providers and highly moral, less competent service providers. Counter to research on general impression formation, which shows that moral traits dominate competence traits, the authors demonstrate that when choosing between service providers, consumers systematically value competence more than morality. However, underdog positioning moderates this effect. When a moral service provider is positioned as an underdog, consumers feel empathy, thereby attenuating the dominance of competence. Notably, although underdog positioning can help a moral provider overcome a deficit in competence, it does not help a competent service provider overcome a deficit in morality or a warm provider overcome a deficit in competence. Thus, underdog positioning is particularly well suited for less competent service providers who are highly moral.",0
"No Pain, No Gain: A Critical Review of the Literature on Signaling Unobservable Product Quality",Journal of Marketing,2000,"Recent research in information economics has focused on signals as mechanisms to solve problems that arise under asymmetric information. A firm or individual credibly communicates the level of some unobservable element in a transaction by providing an observable signal. When applied to conveying product quality information, this issue is of particular interest to the discipline of marketing. In this article, the authors focus on the ways a firm may signal the unobservable quality of its products through several marketing-mix variables. The authors develop a typology that classifies signals and discuss the available empirical evidence on the signaling properties of several marketing variables. They consider managerial implications of signaling and outline an agenda for future empirical research.",0
Vigilant against Manipulation: The Effect of Regulatory Focus on the Use of Persuasion Knowledge,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article proposes that compared with a promotion regulatory focus, a prevention focus increases sensitivity to the advertiser's manipulative intent. Specifically, when message cues make manipulative intent moderately salient, prevention-focused people are more likely to activate persuasion knowledge and give less favorable brand evaluations than promotion-focused people. When message cues make manipulative intent highly salient or when manipulative intent is not salient, brand evaluations do not differ across regulatory foci. In addition, externally priming suspicion of manipulative intent makes promotion-focused people react similarly to prevention-focused people, suggesting that regulatory focus affects vigilance against persuasion.",1
Bonuses versus Commissions: A Field Study,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Quota-based bonuses and commissions are the two most common incentive compensation plans. The authors uncover differential effects of these plans from a natural field-based experiment featuring 14,000 monthly observations over three years from 458 sales territories of a pharmaceutical firm that switched from a bonus plan to an equivalent commission plan. The intervention led to significant sales productivity improvement; this effect was heterogeneous across ability deciles, with much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The authors find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through ?timing games.? At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable output). To organize their findings, the authors build a simple theoretical model in the personnel economics tradition. The novel result that multitasking concerns are reduced under bonus plans when the quota has been met provides a nuanced rationale for the widespread existence of lump-sum bonus plans.",1
Extending Compromise Effect Models to Complex Buying Situations and Other Context Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Building on the work of Dhar, Menon, and Maach (2004), this commentary describes how the compromise effect models developed in the work of Kivetz, Netzer, and Srinivasan (2004) can be extended to predict complex (business-to-business) purchase decisions and additional behavioral context effects. The authors clarify their general modeling approach and outline how it applies to choices among solutions (augmented products) and group decision making. They then hypothesize about the influence of business-to-business and technology markets on various context effects (e.g., compromise and asymmetric dominance). They show how the models incorporate various context effects and discuss ideas for further research.",1
Alternative Models for Capturing the Compromise Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The compromise effect denotes the finding that brands gain share when they become the intermediate rather than extreme option in a choice set. Despite the robustness and importance of this phenomenon, choice modelers have neglected to incorporate the compromise effect in formal choice models and to test whether such models outperform the standard value maximization model. In this article, the authors suggest four context-dependent choice models that can conceptually capture the compromise effect. Although the models are motivated by theory from economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications, the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference point over ?tournament models? in which each option serves as a reference point. They discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research as well as the ability of the proposed models to predict other behavioral context effects.",1
The Effects of Incomplete Information on Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Two current trends, information overload and marketers' increased control over the manner in which their products are sold and presented to buyers (e.g., on the Internet), suggest that deciding what information to provide or not to provide can determine a product's success in the marketplace. Although it has long been recognized that most purchase decisions are made with incomplete information, researchers still know little about the effect of missing information on consumer choice. Building on prior work by Slovic and MacPhillamy (1974), the authors demonstrate that a tendency to give more weight to attributes on which all considered options have values (common attributes), compared with attributes for which not all options have values (unique attributes), can often lead to intransitive preferences. Using process measures, the authors further show that buyers tend to interpret missing attribute values in a way that supports the purchase of the option that is superior on the common attribute. The results indicate that information presentation format and inferences about missing values cannot account for the observed effects of missing information on consumer choice. The authors also show that the purchase decisions of buyers who consider attribute importance before making a choice and those with high need for cognition are less susceptible to influence by missing information. Finally, the findings indicate that choosing from sets with missing information can affect buyer tastes and purchase decisions made subsequently. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.",1
Earning the Right to Indulge: Effort as a Determinant of Customer Preferences toward Frequency Program Rewards,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Although frequency programs (FPs) have become ubiquitous in the marketplace and a key marketing-mix tool for promoting customer relationship and loyalty, little is known about the factors that determine how such programs are evaluated by consumers. The authors investigate the impact of the level of effort participants must invest to obtain the reward on the types of rewards they prefer and, consequently, on the decision to join the FP. In particular, the authors propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity to luxury rewards, because higher efforts reduce the guilt that is often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities. A series of studies with approximately 3100 consumers demonstrated that (1) higher program requirements shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (2) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (3) the effect of program requirements on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure. In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards. The authors discuss the theoretical implications of this research and the practical implications with respect to the design, targeting, and promotion of FPs.",1
The Idiosyncratic Fit Heuristic: Effort Advantage as a Determinant of Consumer Response to Loyalty Programs,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Over the past few years, customer relationship management and loyalty programs (LPs) have been widely adopted by companies and have received a great deal of attention from marketers, consultants, and, to a lesser degree, academics. In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the ?idiosyncratic fit heuristic,? whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.",1
"The Goal-Gradient Hypothesis Resurrected: Purchase Acceleration, Illusionary Goal Progress, and Customer Retention",Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The goal-gradient hypothesis denotes the classic finding from behaviorism that animals expend more effort as they approach a reward. Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real caf reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting ?bonus? stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a ?regular? 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal. In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients. They discuss the theoretical significance of their findings and the managerial implications for incentive systems, promotions, and customer retention.",1
Negativity in the Evaluation of Political Candidates,Journal of Marketing,2005,Prior research has demonstrated a clear negativity effect (greater weighting of candidate weaknesses compared with strengths) in the evaluation of U.S. presidential candidates in each of the past six elections analyzed. The authors adopt a motivational view and question the robustness of this finding. They reanalyze past National Election Studies data along with new data and conclude that the negativity effect is not universal across voters; it is a robust effect only for voters who dislike the candidate. They argue that previous findings are due to aggregation of data across voters who vary in their motivations.,0
Why We Boycott: Consumer Motivations for Boycott Participation,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Although boycotts are increasingly relevant for management decision making, there has been little research of an individual consumer's motivation to boycott. Drawing on the helping behavior and boycott literature, the authors take a cost?benefit approach to the decision to boycott and present a conceptualization of motivations for boycott participation. The authors tested their framework during an actual boycott of a multinational firm that was prompted by factory closings. Consumers who viewed the closures as egregious were more likely to boycott the firm, though only a minority did so. Four factors are found to predict boycott participation: the desire to make a difference, the scope for self-enhancement, counterarguments that inhibit boycotting, and the cost to the boycotter of constrained consumption. Furthermore, self-enhancement and constrained consumption are significant moderators of the relationship between the perceived egregiousness of the firm's actions and boycott participation. The authors also explore the role of perceptions of others? participation and discuss implications for marketers, nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, and researchers.",0
The Secret Ingredient Is Me: Customization Prompts Self-Image-Consistent Product Perceptions,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Companies frequently allow customers to customize products by assembling different product features or ingredients. Whereas existing research has demonstrated that customers assign greater overall value to customized products, this research focuses on the effect of customization on customers? perceptions of specific product attributes (e.g., how healthy a product is). The findings of six studies?in the field, laboratory, and online?demonstrate that customizers and noncustomizers differ in their product perceptions even if the product is objectively the same. This is because customization leads customers to perceive the product in line with their own self-image (e.g., as an unhealthy eater), a phenomenon that the authors term ?self-image-consistent product perceptions.? Essentially, customization may influence product perceptions depending on the product and individuals? self-image; this can have downstream consequences on recommendations and social media communication. The authors test this theory for different product categories (clothing, food, and vacation packages) and attributes (fashionable, healthy, and adventurous) and demonstrate that framing customization as a simple choice or strengthening product positioning through labeling mitigates negative effects of customization.",1
Threats to the External Validity of Brand Extension Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The findings of prior research suggest that a brand's extendibility is constrained by the degree of perceived fit between the brand and extension product categories. However, there are many examples of brands that have been extended successfully into ?perceptually distant? domains. Drawing on theories of consumer information processing and product adoption, the authors identify three background traits of prior work that may help explain the discrepancy between prior research and marketplace observation: (1) limited extension information, (2) failure to account for consumers' new product adoption tendencies (i.e., earlier versus later), and (3) single exposure to proposed extensions. In this study, the authors find that the effects of fit disappear when attribute information is added to extension stimuli and are applicable only for later product adopters. The authors also find that perceived fit increases with greater exposure to an extension. Beyond implications for brand extension research, this study underscores the need to recognize that certain research design factors related to external validity, which are often assumed irrelevant, can alter what is held to be true.",1
Entrepreneurship and Marketing Strategy: The SME under Globalization,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Globalization and the emergence of internationally active small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are key worldwide trends. The author investigates the interrelationships of entrepreneurial orientation, marketing strategy, tactics, and firm performance among SMEs affected by globalization. The author offers empirical findings and conclusions on the critical roles of entrepreneurship and marketing to assist SME managers.",0
Educator Insights: International Marketing Blunders by American Firms in Japan?Some Lessons for Management,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article investigates separate cases of marketing blunders committed by prominent multinationals in Japan. Examined are General Mills, Avon Cosmetics, Simmons Mattress, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler. A pattern of fundamental blunders is revealed that is common to all. This pattern and the lessons it suggests for management are discussed in detail. Suggestions are offered on how marketing blunders can best be avoided, in general, by firms seeking to sell in international markets.",0
Customer Complaints and Recovery Effectiveness: A Customer Base Approach,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although customer complaints are a well-studied aspect of business, no study has measured the impact of actual complaints and recoveries on subsequent customer purchasing. The authors develop a customer base model to investigate the effectiveness of recovery in preventing customer churn. They calibrate it on panel data that track actual purchases, complaints, and recoveries for 20,000 new customers of an Internet and catalog retailer over 2.5 years. Complaints are associated with a substantial increase in the probability that the customer stops buying, but the size of the increase depends on prior customer experiences: prior purchases mitigate the effect, and their impact is long-lasting, whereas prior complaints exacerbate the effect, but their impact is short-lived. Thus, unless the customer leaves the company after a complaint, or a second failure occurs shortly after the first, the relationship quickly returns to normal. Recovery counters the effect of the complaint but, in almost all cases, does not entirely offset it. The authors use simulation to translate the results to financial impact and discuss implications for researchers and managers.",0
Segmented Switchers and Retailer Pricing Strategies,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Empirical studies reveal a surprisingly wide variety of pricing strategies among retailers, even among Internet sellers of undifferentiated homogeneous goods, such as books and music CDs. Several empirical findings remain puzzling; for example, within the same market, some small retailers decide to discount deeply, whereas others forgo the price-sensitive switchers and price high. The authors present theoretical and empirical analyses that address these varied pricing strategies. A model of three asymmetric firms shows that under multiple switcher segments, in which different switchers compare prices at different retailers, firm-specific loyalty is not sufficient to explain the variety of pricing strategies. The authors demonstrate that a retailer's strategy to discount deeply or frequently is driven by the ratio of the size of switcher segments for which the retailer competes to its loyal segment size. The relative switcher-to-loyal ratios among retailers explain situations in which a small retailer finds it optimal to price high, despite having few loyals, or to discount and go for the switchers. The results of two empirical studies confirm the model's predictions for varied pricing strategies in the context of Internet booksellers. The analyses also present several implications. A small retailer can sometimes benefit from strategically limiting its access to switchers to soften price competition. A midsized retailer can benefit from targeting its switcher acquisition activities toward its larger rival, given the shallower discounts involved. When most switchers widely compare prices, a large retailer should offer few shallow discounts because other firms will more aggressively discount. The importance of switcher segmentation suggests that managers should carefully measure switching behavior in devising pricing strategies.",0
Toward a Universal Account of Country-Induced Predispositions: Integrative Framework and Measurement of Country-of-Origin Images and Country Emotions,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Understanding how consumers use a product?s country-of-origin (COO) cue is fundamental to explaining their behavior in a globalized marketplace. While the study of COO is one of the most popular topics in international marketing, the ambiguity regarding its conceptualization, composite nature, operationalization, and measurement deserves further scrutiny. The authors propose an integrative framework that unites two separate areas of research on the COO cue: performance-related COO images and performance-unrelated country emotions. The authors reconcile diverse existing perspectives from both areas into the overarching country-induced predispositions model. Conceptualizations and measurement approaches for the model?s five components are developed and empirically validated across three countries and with five COOs. The model offers researchers and managers with an interest in the COO cue a flexible and operational roadmap, with scales both for in-depth analyses and parsimonious additional testing.",0
The Effect of Fitness Branding on Restrained Eaters? Food Consumption and Postconsumption Physical Activity,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"People who want to control their body weight often aim to regulate both energy intake (by reducing food consumption) and energy expenditure (by increasing physical activity), thus addressing both sides of the energy balance equation. Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food) on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained) eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance.",1
A Meta-Analysis of Marketing Communication Carryover Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"To optimally set marketing communication (?marcom?) budgets, reliable estimates of short-term elasticities and carryover effects are required. Empirical generalizations from meta-analyses of prior field studies can help guide these decisions. However, the last such meta-analysis of marcom carryover effects was performed on Koyck model?based estimates collected before 1984 and was confined to mass media advertising. The authors update and extend extant empirical generalizations via two meta-analyses of carryover estimates compiled from studies encompassing personal selling, targeted advertising, and mass media advertising, using diverse model forms, until 2015. The first is focused on and utilizes 918 estimates of the carryover proportion of the total effect, termed long-term share of the total effect, and the second focuses on 863 derivable estimates of 90% implied duration intervals. The authors find the mean long-term shares of the total effect for personal selling (.687) and targeted advertising (.650) are distinctly larger than that for mass media advertising (.523) and the corresponding median 90% implied duration intervals are 12.6, 2, and 3.4 months, respectively. The authors conclude by discussing differences by model type and the implications for marcom budget-setting and analyses.",1
Return on Interactivity: The Impact of Online Agents on Newcomer Adjustment,Journal of Marketing,2011,"As service offerings grow in both range and complexity, how service providers and their customers interact is becoming increasingly important. In response to the challenge of optimizing these interactions, companies have introduced sophisticated online ?socialization agents,? whose purpose is to help new customers more effectively adjust to and function within the service environment. The objective of these online agents, or virtual employees, is to help customers evaluate new or unfamiliar service offerings, as well as help companies achieve greater levels of service delivery and financial performance. To investigate this, the authors analyze the process by which online agents help both new and current customers adjust to and function within new, unfamiliar, or complex service contexts. They examine the impact of an online agent on account performance in the banking industry. They find that both interaction style and content of the online agent significantly influence the newcomer adjustment process over time, which in turn influences firm-level performance.",0
Category- versus Brand-Level Advertising Messages in a Highly Regulated Environment,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors examine the dynamic effects of category- and brand-level advertising for a new pharmaceutical in a market in which regulations require that the content of these two types of advertising be mutually exclusive. Specifically, category, or generic, messages should communicate information only about the disease without promoting any brand, whereas brand-level messages should be void of any therapeutic information. This brings up two questions of great managerial importance: Which type of message is generally more effective (category or brand level), and when is one type more effective than the other? The authors pursue these questions by analyzing the effects of advertising on new and refill prescriptions through the use of an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations. The findings suggest the presence of complex dynamics for both types of regulation-induced advertising messages. In general, brand advertising is more effective, especially after competitive entry. Extensive validation tests confirm the superiority of the modeling approach. The authors discuss implications for managers and regulators.",1
The Anatomy of the Advertising Budget Decision: How Analytics and Heuristics Drive Sales Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors investigate how heuristics and analytics contribute to the advertising budget decision by decomposing it into four components: (1) baseline spending, (2) adaptive experimentation, (3) advertising-to-sales ratio, and (4) competitive parity. They propose a methodology to estimate and infer the weights of these four components. Applying this methodology to sales and advertising data across eight brands from three categories substantiates for the first time, and uniformly across all brands, that managers depart from optimality through adaptive experimentation, which is in line with dual control theory that suggests they do so to learn about advertising effectiveness. The adaptive experimentation finding, combined with evidence on the use of heuristic methods, suggests that budget decision making is characterized by bounded rationality. Furthermore, budgeting decisions are brand-specific, reflecting the considerations of a brand?s market position and performance. Finally, simulation studies show that brands from categories with high uncertainty in advertising effectiveness can benefit from double-digit revenue lifts by placing higher emphasis on adaptive experimentation.",1
A Silver Lining of Standing in Line: Queuing Increases Value of Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article examines a silver lining of standing in line: Consumers infer that products are more valuable when others are behind them. Specifically, the value of a product increases as more people line up behind a person (Study 1) and when others are present (versus absent) behind a person in line (Study 2). Value increases further when directing consumers' attention to the presence of others behind them?that is, when they look backward versus forward (Study 3) and when the queue structure emphasizes the last person to join rather than the person being served (Study 4). This effect of people in line behind them is associated with increased expenditures by queuing consumers (Study 5).",1
The Effects of Advertised Quality Emphasis and Objective Quality on Sales,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Given that consumers value quality, and advertising content informs consumers? beliefs about quality, it is not surprising that high-quality brands emphasize quality in their advertising content. What is less obvious is whether firms with lower-quality brands should also follow suit and emphasize quality in their advertising to signal a higher quality. We examine this issue and study the effectiveness of quality-based advertising messages. Our field study relates brands? monthly sales to their advertised quality claims across 1,876 print ads in national magazines and Consumer Reports?based product quality ratings over more than two decades. Contrary to the generally held yet erroneous belief in the efficacy of low-quality products emphasizing quality in their advertising, we demonstrate that (1) it is not beneficial for a low-quality firm to emphasize quality in its advertising, and (2) it is effective for a high-quality firm to do so. An analysis of parameter values from a published category-agnostic simulation and an experiment that examines consumers? responses to quality claims in a second product category yields convergent insights.",0
Strategic Management of Expectations: The Role of Disconfirmation Sensitivity and Perfectionism,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors suggest that people strategically manage?specifically, lower?their expectations to increase future satisfaction. Consumers who are more disconfirmation sensitive, that is, those who are more satisfied (dissatisfied) when a product performs better (worse) than expected, are hypothesized to have lower expectations. In contrast, the authors expect that consumers who are perfectionists will have higher expectations than those who are not. Results from a laboratory experiment and a field study are consistent with the hypotheses. Furthermore, the authors identify a possible third type of expectation (?as-if?) that serves as a basis for post-purchase evaluation and provide preliminary evidence that it differs from both will and should expectations.",1
The Importance of the Raw Idea in Innovation: Testing the Sow's Ear Hypothesis,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"How important is the original conception of an idea?the ?raw? idea? to an innovation's success? In this article, the authors explore whether raw ideas judged as ?better? fare better in the market and also determine the strength of that relationship. The empirical context is Quirky.com, a community-driven product development company for household consumer products. The data include descriptions of the raw ideas as originally proposed, the ultimate product designs that resulted from those ideas, and sales figures. In addition, they contain two measures of idea quality: those from online consumer panelists and those from expert evaluators. The authors note the following findings: First, online consumer panels are a better way to determine a ?good? idea than are ratings by experts. Second, predictions with samples as small as 20 consumers are reliable. Third, there is a stronger predictive link between raw ideas and consumers? purchase intent of final product designs than there is between those intentions and market outcomes. Fourth, the commercial importance of the raw idea is large, with ideas one standard deviation better translating to an approximately 50% increase in sales rate.",1
"Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees",Journal of Marketing,2014,"This study examines frontline employee responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) using a multisourced data set at a Global 500 financial services company. The authors find that frontline employees identify with the organization (i.e., organizational identification) and with customers (i.e., employee?customer identification) as a function of how much the employees perceive management and customers (respectively) to support the company's CSR activities. However, these respective effects are stronger among employees for whom CSR is already tied to their sense of self (i.e., CSR importance to the employee). In addition, both organizational identification and employee?customer identification are related to supervisor-rated job performance; however, only the effect of employee?customer identification is mediated by customer orientation, suggesting that these two targets of identification manifest through distinct mechanisms. The research empirically addresses the open questions of whether and when CSR can yield observable changes in employee behavior and alerts researchers to a novel target of identification for frontline employees.",0
Audience Characteristics and Bundling: A Hedonic Analysis of Magazine Advertising Rates,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Increasingly, magazines are able to offer potential advertisers all their readers (pure bundling), only specific reader segments (pure components pricing), or a combination of the two (mixed bundling). Using data on advertising rates and reader demographics, the authors estimate the implicit prices of reader characteristics within a hedonic framework. The results suggest that the magnitude of the price and revenue premiums earned by ?unbundling? a magazine's readers can be substantial.",1
Moderating Effects of the Relationship between Private Label Share and Store Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2014,"A key benefit of private labels for retailers is their potential to increase customers? store loyalty. However, previous research has not examined how this relationship varies across customers and situations. This study contributes to knowledge in this area by developing a conceptual framework that guides the investigation of the role of four moderating factors in strengthening the private label brand share?store loyalty link: (1) customers? price-oriented behavior, (2) degree of commoditization of the product category, (3) product category involvement, and (4) the retailer's price positioning. This article draws on a large-scale empirical study using a household panel and questionnaire data for 35 diverse fast-moving consumer goods product categories. The results of this study show that the relationship between private label share and store loyalty is more complex than previous research has suggested. Specifically, the private label brand share?store loyalty link is stronger for customers with high price-oriented behavior, retailers with a low price positioning, and product categories that are less commoditized and have relatively higher involvement.",0
Are Consumers Really Willing to Pay More for a Favorable Country Image? A Study of Country-of-Origin Effects on Willingness to Pay,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Price-related consequences of the country-of-origin (COO) cue have received limited attention in extant literature. In this study, the authors draw from equity theory and cue utilization theory and investigate (1) whether a brand's COO affects a consumer's willingness to pay and (2) the extent to which the consumer's familiarity with the brand moderates this relationship. The results of three complementary experimental studies reveal that COO indeed has a positive impact on willingness to pay. Furthermore, the authors find a negative moderating influence of brand familiarity on the COO effect in a high-involvement setting but not in a low-involvement setting. The authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings, and they identify directions for further research.",0
Willingness to Pay for Cause-Related Marketing: The Impact of Donation Amount and Moderating Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Companies increasingly employ cause-related marketing to enhance customer goodwill and improve their image. However, because these efforts have major implications for pricing strategy and firm profitability, understanding the relationship between the company's donation amount and customers? willingness to pay is important. In particular, little is known about the moderating effects that influence this relationship or their underlying mechanisms. Study 1 confirms that two types of customer predispositions moderate the link between donation amount and willingness to pay: donation-related and cause-related predispositions. Three additional studies focus on the negative moderating effect of company?cause fit and provide insights into the underlying moderation process. Specifically, the motives customers attribute to the company mediate the moderating impact of fit on the donation amount?WTP link (Study 2), which occurs particularly in cases of utilitarian (Study 3) and privately consumed products (Study 4).",1
Patterns and Technological Implications of Global Sourcing Strategies: A Study of European and Japanese Multinational Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1993,This study reports sourcing strategies used by European and Japanese multinational firms and their implications on the transferability of the firms? product and manufacturing process technology. Globalization of markets has a strong impact on firms? sourcing and marketing strategies. The results suggest the uncoupling of innovation location from actual production location. It is strongly motivated both by the growing competitive threat in the global marketplace and by the expectation of increased payoffs to rapid introduction of advanced product and manufacturing process innovations.,0
Global Sourcing of Services and Market Performance: An Empirical Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Global procurement of services has received an increasing amount of managerial attention in recent years. Service firms seem to have begun sourcing some of their activities from abroad in much the same way that manufacturing firms have outsourced in the past 30 years. However, little is known about the performance implications of a service sourcing strategy. This study applies, with appropriate modifications, a global components/finished goods sourcing strategy framework to the service sector. It also tests hypotheses relating service firms? global sourcing strategy to their market performance.",0
Reinventing Marketing to Manage the Environmental Imperative,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Marketers in the past have based their strategies on the assumption of infinite resources and zero environmental impact. With the growing recognition of finite resources and high environmental costs, marketers need to reexamine their theory and practices. They need to revise their policies on product development, pricing, distribution, and branding. The recent financial meltdown has added another layer of concern as consumers adjust their lifestyles to a lower level of income and spending. Companies must balance more carefully their growth goals with the need to pursue sustainability. Increased attention will be paid to employing demarketing and social marketing thinking to meet the new challenges.",0
Multiformat Digital Products: How Design Attributes Interact with Usage Situations to Determine Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Technological advances enable companies to offer information products such as books, music, and movies in electronic formats, in addition to the traditional physical formats. Although one format may appear more useful and be preferred, consumers may be enticed to consider the unique attributes of all formats if they deliver equally well on salient attributes. The authors investigate the impact of usage situations, relative attribute quality levels of the formats and their interactions on the perception of the formats as perfect or imperfect substitutes or complements, and the purchase likelihood of the bundle of formats. The study demonstrates that when formats have equivalent quality on a salient attribute, consumers perceive the formats as more complementary and are more likely to buy the bundle. This happens because consumers consider more usage situations for the formats and view the bundle as providing greater flexibility for future usages.",1
The Field behind the Screen: Using Netnography for Marketing Research in Online Communities,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The author develops ?netnography? as an online marketing research technique for providing consumer insight. Netnography is ethnography adapted to the study of online communities. As a method, netnography is faster, simpler, and less expensive than traditional ethnography and more naturalistic and unobtrusive than focus groups or interviews. It provides information on the symbolism, meanings, and consumption patterns of online consumer groups. The author provides guidelines that acknowledge the online environment, respect the inherent flexibility and openness of ethnography, and provide rigor and ethics in the conduct of marketing research. As an illustrative example, the author provides a netnography of an online coffee newsgroup and discusses its marketing implications.",1
Networked Narratives: Understanding Word-of-Mouth Marketing in Online Communities,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing?firms? intentional influencing of consumer-to-consumer communications?is an increasingly important technique. Reviewing and synthesizing extant WOM theory, this article shows how marketers employing social media marketing methods face a situation of networked coproduction of narratives. It then presents a study of a marketing campaign in which mobile phones were seeded with prominent bloggers. Eighty-three blogs were followed for six months. The findings indicate that this network of communications offers four social media communication strategies?evaluation, embracing, endorsement, and explanation. Each is influenced by character narrative, communications forum, communal norms, and the nature of the marketing promotion. This new narrative model shows that communal WOM does not simply increase or amplify marketing messages; rather, marketing messages and meanings are systematically altered in the process of embedding them. The theory has definite, pragmatic implications for how marketers should plan, target, and leverage WOM and how scholars should understand WOM in a networked world.",0
Online Relationship Formation,Journal of Marketing,2017,"As online shopping evolves from being primarily transactional to being more relational, sellers aim to form online relationships. This article investigates online relationship formation, identifies the performance payoffs that result from forming different types of online relationships (unilateral vs. reciprocal), and tests the most effective relationship-building strategies. Study 1, based on a longitudinal buyer-level analysis of an online shopping community, reveals that buyers use community-, seller-, and buyer-generated signals to identify suitable relationship partners and reduce online shopping risk. These signals generally diminish in importance as buyers gain experience but become more important when buyers are forming reciprocal relationships. Study 2 evaluates the dynamic payoffs of online relationship formation (seller-level analysis) on sales; the effect on sales of reciprocal relationships is three times greater and lasts seven times longer than that of seller-initiated, unilateral relationships. Study 3 is a field experiment testing managerially actionable strategies for leveraging relationships to grow online sales. Tenets arising from differences between online and offline relationships, together with the results from the three studies, inform an emerging theory of online relationships.",0
Making Healthful Food Choices: The Influence of Health Claims and Nutrition Information on Consumers? Evaluations of Packaged Food Products and Restaurant Menu Items,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors report the results of three experiments that address the effects of health claims and nutrition information placed on restaurant menus and packaged food labels. The results indicate that when favorable nutrition information or health claims are presented, consumers have more favorable attitudes toward the product, nutrition attitudes, and purchase intentions, and they perceive risks of heart disease and stroke to be lower. The nutritional context in which a restaurant menu item is presented moderates the effects of both nutrition information and a health claim on consumer evaluations, which suggests that alternative (i.e., nontarget) menu items serve as a frame of reference against which the target menu item is evaluated.",0
The Effect of Measurement Task Transparency on Preference Construction and Evaluations of Personalized Recommendations,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Marketing activities frequently involve personalizing product offers to consumers' individually measured preferences. Because preferences are often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks). However, this difference in choice likelihood due to task transparency is observed only for novices (versus experts), and making the identification of stated preferences more difficult eliminates the effect by decreasing the choice likelihood following more (versus less) transparent tasks. The author identifies consumers' understanding of their own preferences as the mechanism underlying the task transparency effect. The findings provide evidence that consumers must be able to ?see through? or understand the construction of their preferences to maximize utility.",1
"The Relative Impact of Marketing, Research-and-Development, and Operations Capabilities on Firm Performance",Journal of Marketing,2008,"The impact of the marketing function on firm performance has been the focus of much recent research in marketing. Thus, the effect of marketing capability on firm performance, compared with that of other capabilities, such as research and development and operations, is an issue of importance to managers. To examine this issue and generate empirical generalizations, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the firm capability?performance relationship using a mixed-effects model. The results show that, in general, marketing capability has a stronger impact on firm performance than research-and-development and operations capabilities. The results provide guidelines for managers and generate directions for further research.",0
The Impact of Customer Relationship Management Implementation on Cost and Profit Efficiencies: Evidence from the U.S. Commercial Banking Industry,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The impact of customer relationship management (CRM) implementation on firm performance is an issue of considerable debate. This study examines the impact of CRM implementation on two metrics of firm performance?operational (cost) efficiency and the ability of firms to generate profits (profit efficiency)?using a large sample of U.S. commercial banks. The authors use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate cost and profit efficiencies and employ hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effect of CRM implementation on cost and profit efficiencies. They find that CRM implementation is associated with a decline in cost efficiency but an increase in profit efficiency. A firm-level factor, CRM commitment, reduces the negative effect of CRM implementation on cost efficiency. The authors also find that two adoption-related factors, time of adoption and time since adoption, influence the relationship between CRM implementation and cost and profit efficiencies. Early adopters benefit less from CRM implementation than late adopters. However, time since adoption improves the performance of firms that implement CRM. By demonstrating the different ways CRM implementation influences cost and profit measures, the study provides valuable insights to CRM researchers and managers.",0
Evaluating the Financial Impact of Branding Using Trademarks: A Framework and Empirical Evidence,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Firms spend considerable efforts to build brand awareness and associations among consumers. Yet there is a limited understanding of the financial returns of such investments. In this article, the authors present a framework that uses trademarks as measures of firms' branding efforts. They classify trademarks into two categories?brand-identification trademarks and brand-association trademarks?and propose that they are indicators of firm efforts to build brand awareness and associations among consumers, respectively. The authors then evaluate the chain of effects linking such assets with metrics of firms' financial value. A longitudinal analysis of data collected from secondary sources reveals that the stock (i.e., total number) of brand-association trademarks available to firms in time period t increases their cash flow, Tobin's q, return on assets, and stock returns and reduces their cash-flow variability in period t + 1. Furthermore, the authors observe that the stock of brand-identification trademarks owned by firms in period t ? 1 influences the effects of brand-association trademarks on cash flow, Tobin's q, and stock returns. Together, these findings provide useful insights into the financial value of branding.",0
The Tenure-Based Customer Retention Model: A Cross-Cultural Validation,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"International businesses and their marketing managers face complexity in the targeting of different customer groups in multiple countries, with different purchase histories and brand relationship tenures. Thus far, no customer retention model has been suggested to sufficiently reduce such complexity. To fill the gap, this study distinguishes three global customer groups?brand stayers, brand switchers, and category novices?which are differently prevalent in countries of various economic development. In particular, category novices have been a largely neglected segment for emerging markets. The study introduces the tenure-based customer retention model, which proposes the idiosyncratic effects of each group on the basis of tenure-based and attitudinal repurchase drivers. A large-scale consumer study (N = 53,744; 30 countries) cross-culturally validates the suggested model and reflects country-specific factors based on cultural dimensions instead of economic development. The findings broadly support the standardization of international marketing over different countries but not across different buyer segments. Consequently, the study offers insights into the communicative measures that can be used to globally address repurchase intent for each segment.",0
Competently Ordinary: New Middle Class Consumers in the Emerging Markets,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption??formulaic creativity??which addresses consumers? desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies. The article provides recommendations on product portfolio management, positioning strategies, and marketing mix adaptation decisions.",0
Gender (Still) Matters in Business School,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research documents systematic gender performance differences (GPD) at a top business school using a unique administrative data set and survey of students. The findings show that women?s grades are 11% of a standard deviation lower in quantitative courses than those of men with similar academic aptitude and demographics, and men?s grades are 23% of a standard deviation lower in nonquantitative courses than those of comparable women. The authors discuss and test for different reasons to explain this finding. They show that a female instructor significantly cuts down GPD for quantitative courses by raising the relative grades of female students. In addition, female instructors increase women?s interest and performance expectations in these courses and are perceived as role models by their female students. These results provide support for a gender stereotype process for GPD and show that faculty can serve as powerful exemplars to challenge gender stereotypes and increase student achievement. The authors discuss several important implications of these findings for business schools and for society.",1
Impact of a Late Entrant on the Diffusion of a New Product/Service,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Starting with Bass's (1969) article, diffusion researchers have predominantly focused on modeling category-level sales growth and issues surrounding it. In this article, the authors propose a brand-level diffusion model and demonstrate its managerial use by applying it to the following issue: If a new brand enters a category that has not attained its peak sales, how can a practicing manager evaluate its impact on the category and on the incumbent brands? The proposed model helps the manager diagnose whether the late entrant affects the market potential and/or the diffusion speed of the category and of the incumbent brands. The authors test the model using brand-level sales data from the cellular telephone industry in multiple markets.",1
Go Green! Should Environmental Messages be So Assertive?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Environmental communications often contain assertive commands, even though research in consumer behavior, psycholinguistics, and communications has repeatedly shown that gentler phrasing is more effective when seeking consumer compliance. This article shows that the persuasiveness of assertive language depends on the perceived importance of the issue at hand: Recipients respond better to pushy requests in domains that they view as important, but they need more suggestive appeals when they lack initial conviction. The authors examine this effect in three laboratory studies and one field experiment using Google AdWords. Their findings refer to various environmental contexts (i.e., economizing water, recycling plastic containers, reducing air and sea pollution). The key implication of these findings is that issue importance needs to be carefully assessed (or affected) before the language of effective environmental campaigns can be selected.",0
"How Geographic Variation Persists: Comments on ?Consumer Packaged Goods in the United States: National Brands, Local Branding?",Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"There are ample reasons that geographic variation in brand share persists. This comment highlights intentional strategies and feedback loops. Trade promotion, advertising, coupons, and special events are likely to be differentially allocated on the basis of market position and may have different effectiveness. Distribution is highly correlated with share, and distribution can be easier to get and maintain in strong markets. The interaction between retailers and manufacturers at the category level can be strong and persistent and can be observed in market-level data as a market effect.",1
Organizational Responses of U.S. Multinationals to EC-1992: An Empirical Study,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"Issues of standardization of products and marketing programs, and the degree of centralization of marketing decision making and planning, are of vital interest to multinational corporations as they increasingly compete in world markets. Previous research has established the need for some degree of standardization and, therefore, for some degree of centralized decision making. The present study was designed to assess the implications that the creation of the Single Market in the European Community will have on the standardization/centralization issue. Specifically, the role of the European central offices of major U.S. multinational corporations is emphasized. The results of the in-depth study of 22 Fortune 500 U.S. corporations with European central offices located in the United Kingdom indicate a trend toward overall strategic planning at the European central office level. More centralization of the distribution and pricing decisions is also noted for fairly uniform products but, in general, the product part of the marketing mix seems more standardized than the pricing, promotion, and distribution aspects. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research.",0
Market Orientation and Management Practices in Ghanaian Firms: Revisiting the Jaworski and Kohli Framework,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"The work of Jaworski and Kohli (1993) has inspired a substantial body of literature on market orientation, but most replications of their original framework have been in developed countries. This article reports the results of a Ghanaian study that revisits Jaworski and Kohli's framework, and the authors compare the findings with a similar study that was conducted in the Ivory Coast. The authors provide evidence in support of the robustness of the framework and draw attention to the possible variations in the interpretation of the constituent constructs in the original framework. The variations are attributable to cultural differences that affect management practices in different societies.",0
App Popularity: Where in the World are Consumers Most Sensitive to Price and User Ratings?,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Many companies compete globally in a world in which user ratings and price are important drivers of performance but whose importance may differ by country. This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.",0
When Showrooming Increases Retailer Profit,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Showrooming, the phenomenon of consumers visiting a brick-and-mortar (B&M) store to learn about products but then buying online to obtain lower prices, is attracting increased attention both in business practice and in academic literature. It is considered a major threat to the B&M retailers, and determining ?how to fight it? seems to be the only consideration. However, the manufacturer's need for retail informational services has always been one of the essential reasons for retailers to exist and is a means for retailers to achieve profitability. The popular arguments about the threat of showrooming ignore the strategic role of the manufacturer in the distribution channel. This article analytically shows that when the manufacturer's decisions are considered (i.e., when the manufacturer?retailer contract is endogenous), consumers? ability to engage in showrooming may lead to increased, rather than decreased, profitability for B&M retailer(s). Thus, retail efforts to restrict showrooming behavior may be misguided. This result holds even if the manufacturer is restricted to wholesale-only contracts and is not allowed to price discriminate between channels.",1
Endogeneity and Individual Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"In many markets, there is likely to be correlation both across periods in terms of the choices of one consumer and across consumers in terms of their choices in each period. The former is caused by consumer heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms? decisions. In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity, and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and without instrumenting for the explanatory variables. The authors show theoretically that in their estimation method, unobserved heterogeneity does not affect the consistency of the parameter estimates, but if it is not accounted for, endogeneity may bias the results. They present estimation results from simulated and scanner panel data.",1
Competition in a Status Goods Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Consumers value status goods because of the impression status-product ownership makes on other consumers, and this impression depends on the actual distribution of ownership in population. Explicitly modeling consumer value of status products as coming from the information the product ownership conveys to other consumers, the authors show that a status-product manufacturer can benefit from a competitor's cost reduction because of the competitor's price reduction associated with it. In other words, they show that two status products that are (imperfect) substitutes in the consumer utility function may be complements in the profit function. As a consequence, competition could lead to higher prices than the optimal ones under monopoly ownership of both products. The authors confirm the assumptions that consumer value of a status good depends positively on the proportion of desirable type among owners and negatively on the proportion of the desirable type among nonowners in one experiment. Moreover, they find empirical support for the positive effect of a price reduction of one product on the demand for the other product from another experiment.",1
From Social to Sale: The Effects of Firm-Generated Content in Social Media on Customer Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Given the unprecedented reach of social media, firms are increasingly relying on it as a channel for marketing communication. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of firm-generated content (FGC) in social media on three key customer metrics: spending, cross-buying, and customer profitability. The authors further investigate the synergistic effects of FGC with television advertising and e-mail communication. To accomplish their objectives, the authors assemble a novel data set comprising customers? social media participation data, transaction data, and attitudinal data obtained through surveys. The results indicate that after the authors account for the effects of television advertising and e-mail marketing, FGC has a positive and significant effect on customers? behavior. The authors show that FGC works synergistically with both television advertising and e-mail marketing and also find that the effect of FGC is greater for more experienced, tech-savvy, and social media?prone customers. They propose and examine the effect of three characteristics of FGC: valence, receptivity, and customer susceptibility. The authors find that whereas all three components of FGC have a positive impact, the effect of FGC receptivity is the largest. The study offers critical managerial insights regarding how to leverage social media for better returns.",0
Performance Implications of Mismatched Governance Regimes across External and Internal Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This article examines how a manufacturer's governance of an external supplier relationship affects its performance toward a downstream retail customer. In line with sociological and economic theory, a manufacturer's reliance on supplier norms and incentives, respectively, promotes performance. However, the performance effect of each external governance mechanism weakens in the presence of a different governance regime within the manufacturer firm itself. Specifically, internal incentives weaken the effect of external norms, and internal norms weaken the effect of external incentives. From a practical standpoint, these findings point to the difficulty of managing sets of relationships that involve different parties and mechanisms. From a theoretical standpoint, they point to the complex interplay between social norms and economic incentives in driving performance outcomes.",0
The Impact of Cobranding on Customer Evaluation of Brand Counterextensions,Journal of Marketing,2005,"A brand that successfully extends from its parent category into a new extension category often faces a counter-extension by a brand from the extension category back into its own parent category. However, there is little guidance available on how brand extension strategies should be adjusted to mitigate the risk to the parent brand from counterextensions. This research examines the differential impact of cobranded versus solo-branded extensions on customer evaluations of brand counterextensions. It demonstrates that customers evaluate a counterextension less favorably if the preceding extension by the focal brand is cobranded than if it is solo branded. The findings suggest that cobranding not only improves the attribute profile of a brand's own extension but also helps protect the brand against counterextensions.",0
Brand Counterextensions: The Impact of Brand Extension Success versus Failure,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In this article, the author investigates the impact of a brand extension's success versus failure on customer evaluation of brand counter-extensions. A counterextension is a brand extension that is launched into Category A by Brand 2 that belongs to Category B in a reciprocal direction to a launch of a previous extension into Category B by Brand 1 that belongs to Category A. The results from five studies show that customers evaluate a counterextension more favorably when the preceding extension is a success rather than a failure. Furthermore, the evaluation of the counterextension is superior if it is launched by a major brand, especially if the previous successful extension was also launched by a major brand. Finally, a successful extension indirectly dilutes a brand and results in a greater loss in choice share to a counterextension than does a failed extension. The key findings generalize to a sequence of extensions across more than one intercategory boundary.",1
Understanding Cultural Differences in Innovation: A Conceptual Framework and Future Research Directions,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Extant literature on innovation has produced important and significant results. However, no study to date has provided researchers with a framework to understand innovation from a cultural differences perspective. To fill this research gap, the author proposes a framework that categorizes culture and innovation studies into the following six approaches: (1) innovation characteristics, (2) adoption of/propensity to adopt innovations, (3) geographical innovations, (4) market characteristics, (5) learning effect, and (6) organizational functions. Each approach contains two perspectives. From these approaches and perspectives, the author identifies unique and general insights on culture and innovation, discusses the implications of implementing this framework, and recognizes possible areas of further research.",0
"A Theory of Customer Valuation: Concepts, Metrics, Strategy, and Implementation",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Customer value refers to the economic value of the customer's relationship with the firm. This study approaches the topic of customer value for measuring, managing, and maximizing customer contributions by proposing a customer valuation theory (CVT) based on economic principles that conceptualizes the generation of value from customers to firms. The author reviews the established economic theories for valuing investor assets (e.g., stocks) and draws a comparison to valuing customer contributions. Furthermore, the author recognizes the differences in the guiding principles between valuing stocks and valuing customers in proposing CVT. Using CVT, the author discusses the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) as the metric that can provide a reliable, forward-looking estimate of direct customer value. In addition, economic models to estimate CLV, ways to manage CLV using portfolio management principles, and strategies to maximize CLV are discussed in detail. The author extends the customer value concept by discussing ways that a customer can add value to the firm indirectly through incentivized referrals, social media influence, and feedback. Finally, the benefits of CVT to multiple constituencies are offered.",0
"Regaining ?Lost? Customers: The Predictive Power of First-Lifetime Behavior, the Reason for Defection, and the Nature of the Win-Back Offer",Journal of Marketing,2015,"Service firms, which have high attrition rates, are finding it exceedingly difficult to grow their customer base. Despite their extensive retention efforts, customers still defect. For these firms, ?lost? customers may pose a rewarding ?last-resort? opportunity. Reacquiring customers who left the firm may help these firms not only regain their lost profits but also usurp profits from competitors. However, some pertinent questions remain as to whether lost customers are worth the investment in reacquisition and whether they will remain profitable if reacquired. This is the first study to empirically demonstrate how (1) the lost customers' first-lifetime experiences and behaviors, (2) the reason for defection, and (3) the nature of the win-back offer made to lost customers are all related to the likelihood of their reacquisition, their second-lifetime duration, and their second-lifetime profitability per month. The study shows that the stronger the first-lifetime relationship with the firm, the more likely a customer is to accept the win-back offer. This study also presents relevant implications for managers interested in identifying new avenues for growth through effective resource allocation on the reacquisition and management of lost customers. Finally, the authors outline if and when managers should choose between maximizing reacquisition and profitability.",0
Is Market Orientation a Source of Sustainable Competitive Advantage or Simply the Cost of Competing?,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The authors use panel data constructed from the responses of repeatedly surveyed top managers at 261 companies regarding their firm's market orientation, along with objective performance measures, to investigate the influence of market orientation on performance for a nine-year period from 1997 to 2005. The authors measure market orientation in 1997, 2001, and 2005 and estimate it in the interval between these measurement periods. The analyses indicate that market orientation has a positive effect on business performance in both the short and the long run. However, the sustained advantage in business performance from having a market orientation is greater for the firms that are early to develop a market orientation. These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition. Environmental turbulence and competitive intensity moderate the main effect of market orientation on business performance, but the moderating effects are greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s.",0
Are you Back for Good or Still Shopping Around? Investigating Customers' Repeat Churn Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Service firms develop win-back strategies to rectify issues that cause customer churn and rebuild relationships with lost customers. To better support retention, it is important to understand how the revived relationship evolves and possibly ends again. To examine customers' repeat churn behavior, we develop a ?mixture cure-competing risks? model, jointly estimating the duration of second lifetimes, multiple reasons for churn, and heterogeneity of customers in exhibiting a related churn reason. The proposed model is tested using a data set from a large telecommunications provider including information on customer behavior and marketing activities during customers' first and second lifetimes. We find support for the existence of a ?cured? group of returning customers, defined as those who are not susceptible to churn for the same reason they churned previously. Our findings suggest that mitigating repeat churn behavior can extend customers' second lifetime tenure and increase profitability by $150,000 over the lifetime of the customers in the sample (leading to gains of over $15 million for deferring second-lifetime churn in a million returning customers), depending on the type of churn.",1
Competitive Advantage through Engagement,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors highlight the need for and develop a framework for engagement by reviewing the relevant literature and analyzing popular-press articles. They discuss the definitions of the focal constructs?customer engagement (CE) and employee engagement (EE)?in the engagement framework, capture these constructs? multidimensionality, and develop and refine items for measuring CE and EE. They validate the proposed framework with data from 120 companies over two time periods, and they develop strategies to help firms raise their levels of CE and EE to improve performance. They also observe that the influence of EE on CE is moderated by employee empowerment, type of firm (business-to-business [B2B] vs. business-to-consumer [B2C]), and nature of industry (manufacturing vs. service); in particular, this effect is stronger for B2B (vs. B2C) firms and service (vs. manufacturing) firms. The authors find that although both CE and EE positively influence firm performance, the effect of CE on firm performance is stronger. Furthermore, the effect of CE and EE on performance is enhanced for B2B (vs. B2C) and for service (vs. manufacturing) firms.",1
"National Culture, Economy, and Customer Lifetime Value: Assessing the Relative Impact of the Drivers of Customer Lifetime Value for a Global Retailer",Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Customer lifetime value (CLV), a metric used in many industries, is based on the cumulated cash flow a customer accrues during his or her lifetime. Firms have used CLV as a basis for formulating and implementing customer-specific strategies; however, these can vary across countries because of each country's cultural and economic influences. Typically, CLV is computed with three components: purchase frequency, contribution margin, and marketing costs. In this study, the authors demonstrate that national cultural dimensions affect the drivers of purchase frequency and contribution margin and that economic factors influence the components of CLV directly. They use customer-level transaction data from a global retailer for a random sample of customers in 30 representative countries over a six-year period. They estimate the model using a seemingly unrelated regression approach while accounting for the heterogeneity of customers across countries and the endogeneity of marketing costs incurred by the firm. The results indicate that global retailers should pay attention to the dimensions of national culture and economic conditions because of their differential impact on CLV.",0
"Driving Profitability by Encouraging Customer Referrals: Who, When, and How",Journal of Marketing,2010,"Many firms are now using referral marketing campaigns to harness the power of word of mouth and to increase referrals to acquire new customers. Prior research has identified a method of computing the value of referrals using only a customer's actual past referral behavior to compute customer referral value (CRV). In this article, the authors develop and test a new four-step approach to compute CRV. In addition, they determine the behavioral drivers of CRV and then identify the most effective methods of targeting the most promising customers on the basis of their customer lifetime value (CLV) and CRV scores. The authors illustrate and test this approach through four separate field experiments with firms from two industries: financial services and retailing. They find that to maximize profitability, it is critical to manage customers in terms of both their CLV and CRV scores and that understanding the behavioral drivers of CRV can help managers better target the most profitable customers with their referral marketing campaigns.",0
"Defining, Measuring, and Managing Business Reference Value",Journal of Marketing,2013,"It is common for business-to-business firms to use references from client firms when trying to influence prospects to become new customers. In this study, the authors define the concept of business reference value (BRV) as the ability of a client's reference to influence prospects to purchase and the degree to which it does so. They develop a three-step method to compute BRV for a given client using a retrospective reported measure of reference value. Next, they use data from a financial services and a telecommunications firm to identify and empirically test the drivers of BRV. These drivers fall into four categories: (1) length of client relationship, (2) client firm size, (3) reference media format, and (4) reference congruency. Next, the authors empirically show that clients that have the highest BRV are not the same as the clients that have the highest customer lifetime value. They also show that an average client that is high on BRV has significantly different characteristics from the average client that is low on BRV. Finally, they derive implications for managing BRV.",0
Creating Enduring Customer Value,Journal of Marketing,2016,"One of the most important tasks in marketing is to create and communicate value to customers to drive their satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. In this study, the authors assume that customer value is a dual concept. First, in order to be successful, firms (and the marketing function) have to create perceived value for customers. Toward that end, marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second, customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value, in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore, marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions. The authors integrate and synthesize existing findings, show the best practices of implementation, and highlight future research avenues.",0
Expanding the Role of Marketing: From Customer Equity to Market Capitalization,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Can a marketer drive the stock price of the firm? Yes, it should be possible. Toward this endeavor, the authors develop a framework to link customer equity (CE) (as determined by the customer lifetime value metric) to market capitalization (MC) (as determined by the stock price of the firm). The authors test the framework in an empirical field experiment with two Fortune 1000 firms in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts, respectively. The findings show that (1) a CE-based framework can reliably predict the MC of the firm and (2) marketing strategies directed at increasing the CE not only increase the stock price of the firm but also beat market expectations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the relationship between CE and MC is moderated by risk factors in the form of volatility and vulnerability of cash flows from customers. By accounting for these factors, the authors improve the association between CE and MC. The findings broaden the scope and role of marketing while reinforcing the importance of the marketer to any organization.",0
Establishing Profitable Customer Loyalty for Multinational Companies in the Emerging Economies: A Conceptual Framework,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"It has been observed that some firms succeed in their attempts to achieve business goals in emerging economies, whereas others fail. To understand the reasons for this phenomenon, the authors conduct a qualitative study where they interview 42 managers of multinational companies from the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. From the insights gleaned from these interviews and the available literature, they propose a conceptual framework that identifies the possible factors that would drive the creation of both a profitable and a loyal customer base (termed ?profitable customer loyalty? in this study) in the emerging economies. The influencing factors are categorized as customer-specific variables, marketing-mix variables, and firm-specific variables. From these factors, the authors advance research propositions that discuss the potential relationships with profitable customer loyalty. One of this study's key contributions is the proposal that multinational companies monitor the suggested factors and assess a degree of comfort before formulating strategies in the emerging economies. Further research can focus on the empirical validation of the proposed framework.",0
Prevention- Versus Promotion-Focus Regulatory Efforts on the Disease Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19: A Multinational Diffusion Study Using Functional Data Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"International marketing has rarely explored the diffusion patterns of the spread of a disease or analyzed the factors explaining the differences in the disease incidence patterns. The rapid diffusion of the novel coronavirus has engulfed the entire world in a very short time. Many countries experienced different levels of disease incidence and mortality despite implementing similar nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Drawing on the regulatory focus theory, the authors propose a framework to conceptualize and investigate the comparative efficacy of diverse NPIs that countries could adopt to prevent or curtail the diffusion of the disease incidence and mortality. They categorize these NPIs as prevention focused (containment and closures) or promotion focused (relief measures and public health infrastructure) and discuss the moderating factors that enhance or impede their effectiveness. Employing functional data analysis, the authors examine a comprehensive data set across 70 countries. They find that prevention-focused interventions inhibit disease incidence, while promotion-focused interventions enhance the nation?s ability to respond to medical emergencies and augment people?s ability to isolate themselves and slow the spread. The authors also generate insights on how a reallocation of resources between prevention- and promotion-focused efforts influence the evolution of disease incidence and mortality, with various countries falling in different clusters.",0
An Interactive Multicriteria Approach to Identifying Potential Foreign Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"The authors address the issue of portfolio management in the context of an international marketing problem. Screening, identification, and selection characterize the three stages in the evaluation of potential foreign markets. The proposed methodology is used for identifying potential foreign markets. This article contributes to the existing literature in four ways: (a) it integrates the past research on international market evaluation into a comprehensive framework, (b) it fills a gap in this area, by offering a flexible, cost efficient methodology that is easy to comprehend and adopt, (c) it simultaneously considers the objectives of the firm, its resource constraints, and expansion strategies while identifying potential foreign markets, and (d) it introduces a multicriteria methodology for solving problems of multiobjective decision models, to the international marketing managers.",0
Measuring and Managing a Salesperson's Future Value to the Firm,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Research on sales force evaluation has mostly relied on reflective metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and manager evaluations to assess and manage a sales force. However, businesses are moving from a product-centric to a customer-centric view and from a backward-looking to a forward-looking strategic perspective, so sales organizations must adapt to the ever-changing marketplace to maximize performance. The authors propose a forward-looking and profit-oriented metric to evaluate and demonstrate the effects of training type and incentive type on a salesperson's future value. Using a latent class modeling approach, they identify two distinct segments in the sales force that exhibit different responses to varying levels of training and incentives. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to sales force management may be suboptimal. Finally, the authors also evaluate the magnitude of the proposed effects in the short run as well as the long run and show that the magnitudes of the effects could vary depending on the time horizon being considered. The authors close with a discussion of the implications for research and practice, including sales force evaluation through customer relationship management?based heuristics and optimal training and incentive management.",1
Analyzing the Diffusion of Global Customer Relationship Management: A Cross-Regional Modeling Framework,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Most recent research on customer relationship management (CRM) has been restricted to developed economies such as the United States. Researchers have done little to study the growth of CRM in developing markets such as Asia and South America, which are becoming increasingly relevant to business today. With the changing business climate, firms are beginning to embrace the concept of managing customers rather than products. This leads managers down the path of customer centricity, and here lies the relevance of truly global CRM (GCRM). The authors conduct a qualitative study to understand the concept of GCRM and its relevance. Their results quantify the growth of CRM on a global scale using a diffusion modeling framework. The results of the generalized cross-regional diffusion model indicate that there is untapped market potential in the GCRM market, with varying adoption patterns across regions. The authors also propose a conceptual framework to understand the factors that affect cross-regional learning in GCRM adoption. In addition, the study provides insights into implementation and calibration of a GCRM framework and directions for further research.",0
Performance Implications of Adopting a Customer-Focused Sales Campaign,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Through field experiments conducted in two business-to-business firms, the authors evaluate the financial and relational consequences of adopting a customer focus in sales campaigns. In both the experiments, salespeople adopting the customer-focused sales campaign coordinated their sales calls with the objective of selling all the products that a customer was predicted to purchase only at the time the customer was expected to purchase. The authors compare this strategy with the current practice in the organization in which salespeople for each product category independently contacted the customers who were expected to purchase in that category without any guidance on the expected timing of customer purchase. The experiments show that adopting a customer-focused sales campaign can significantly increase firm profits and return on investment. The total incremental profits obtained from implementing the customer-focused sales campaign was more than $1 million. High-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the efficiency of marketing contacts, whereas low-revenue customers were the source of improvements in the effectiveness of the marketing contacts. A customer-focused sales campaign also improved the relationship quality between the customer and the firm. This research provides empirical evidence for theoretical expectations of the benefits provided by a customer-focused sales campaign. Organizations can use the field experiments illustrated in this study as a template for implementing the first step in migrating to a customer-centric organization.",0
Modeling Customer Opt-In and Opt-Out in a Permission-Based Marketing Context,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The rise of new media is helping marketers evolve from digital to interactive marketing, which facilitates a two-way communication between marketers and customers without intruding on their privacy. However, while research has examined the drivers of customers? opt-in and opt-out decisions, it has investigated neither the timing of the two decisions nor the influence of transactional activity on the length of time a customer stays with an e-mail program. In this study, the authors adopt a multivariate copula model using a pair-copula construction method to jointly model opt-in time (from a customer's first purchase to the opt-in decision), opt-out time (from the opt-in decision to the opt-out decision), and average transaction amount. Through such multivariate dependences, this model significantly improves the predictive performance of the opt-out time in comparison with several benchmark models. The study offers several important findings: (1) marketing intensity affects opt-in and opt-out times, (2) customers with certain characteristics are more or less likely to opt in or opt out, and (3) firms can extend customer opt-out time and increase customer spending level by strategically allocating resources.",1
Attractiveness of the New European Market to Small U.S. Exporters,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"The integration of selected west-European countries into a single market has caused concerns about U.S. exporters? access to the new European market. This article examines strategic export planning for the European market of small U.S. exporters in manufacturing industries on the basis of the strategic market planning framework developed by Abell and Hammond (1979). The proposed model incorporates market attractiveness as a predictor variable in addition to more traditional company background variables in examining export planning status of small U.S. exporters. Findings of a survey conducted in a Midwestern state among active exporters of manufactured goods demonstrate how company characteristics and market attractiveness are related to export planning status. Most exporting manufacturers have responded actively to changes in the European market by completing and enacting strategic export plans. Factors that influence exporters? strategic export planning behavior are entry barriers, changes in European market characteristics, company size, exporting experience, and primary export target markets.",0
The Role of the Partner Brand's Social Media Power in Brand Alliances,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Managers frequently seek strategies to profit systematically from social media to increase product sales. By forming a brand alliance, they can acquire an installed social media base from a partner brand in an attempt to boost the sales of their composite products. Drawing from power theory, this article develops a conceptual model of the influence of the social media power of partner brands on brand alliance success. The proposed framework details the partner brand's social media power potential (size and activity of the social media network), social media power exertion (different posting behaviors and comments), and their interaction. The authors test this framework with an extensive data set from the film industry, in which films function as composite products and actors represent partner brands. The data set features 442 movies, including 1,318 actor?movie combinations and weekly social media data (including 41,547 coded Facebook posts). The authors apply a linear mixed-effects model, in which they account for endogeneity concerns. The partner brand's social media power potential, power exertion, and their interaction can all lead to higher composite product sales. By coding different types of product-related posts, this article provides estimates of their varying monetary value.",0
Aggressive Marketing Strategy following Equity Offerings and Firm Value: The Role of Relative Strategic Flexibility,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Firms raise a significant amount of funds and gain competitive advantage over their rivals through equity financing, namely through initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. The authors find that both initial public offering firms and seasoned equity offering firms adopt a more aggressive marketing strategy during the two years following their offering. However, not all equity issuers benefit equally from increased marketing spending, which can help signal companies' growth prospects to investors. A key moderator of the link between marketing investment and firm value is the strategic flexibility of rivals with respect to issuers. In particular, the stock market reacts favorably to an aggressive marketing strategy initiated by issuers competing against rivals with relatively less flexibility, whereas increased marketing expenditures do not translate into higher firm value when rivals have greater flexibility. Furthermore, the authors show that marketing expenditures create value within context: the role of marketing in enhancing shareholder value and the moderating effect of rivals' strategic flexibility are more pronounced in the two-year window immediately following an equity offering than at any other time. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for theory and practice.",0
The Influence of Friends on Consumer Spending: The Role of Agency?Communion Orientation and Self-Monitoring,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Four studies investigate the interactive influence of the presence of an accompanying friend and a consumer's agency?communion orientation on the consumer's spending behaviors. In general, the authors find that shopping with a friend can be expensive for agency-oriented consumers (e.g., males) but not for communion-oriented consumers (e.g., females). That is, consumers who are agency oriented spend significantly more when they shop with a friend (vs. when they shop alone), whereas this effect is attenuated for consumers who are communion oriented. The results also show that this interactive effect is moderated by individual differences in self-monitoring such that friends are especially influential for consumers who are high in self-monitoring, but the effects occur in opposite directions for agency- and communion-oriented consumers (i.e., agentic consumers spend more with a friend, while communal consumers spend less when accompanied by a friend). Finally, the authors test the underlying process and document that the interaction of agency?communion orientation, the presence of a friend, and self-monitoring is reversed when the focal context is changed from ?spending for the self? to ?donating to a charity.? They conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",1
Are Multichannel Customers Really more Valuable? The Moderating Role of Product Category Characteristics,Journal of Marketing,2013,"How does the monetary value of customer purchases vary by customer preference for purchase channels (e.g., traditional, electronic, multichannel) and product category? The authors develop a conceptual model and hypotheses on the moderating effects of two key product category characteristics?the utilitarian versus hedonic nature of the product category and perceived risk?on the channel preference?monetary value relationship. They test the hypotheses on a unique large-scale, empirically generalizable data set in the retailing context. Contrary to conventional wisdom that all multichannel customers are more valuable than single-channel customers, the results show that multichannel customers are the most valuable segment only for hedonic product categories. The findings reveal that traditional channel customers of low-risk categories provide higher monetary value than other customers. Moreover, for utilitarian product categories perceived as high (low) risk, web-only (catalog- or store-only) shoppers constitute the most valuable segment. The findings offer managers guidelines for targeting and migrating different types of customers for different product categories through different channels.",0
Better Not Smile at the Price: The Differential Role of Brand Anthropomorphization on Perceived Price Fairness,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This research shows that brand anthropomorphization increases the perceived unfairness of price increases and the perceived fairness of price decreases. First, analyzing a household panel data set, the authors demonstrate the real-world consequences of brand humanization on consumers' price sensitivity. Second, building on the theoretical premise that fairness judgments depend on consumer focus on the self versus others, they find that brand humanization enhances perceived unfairness of price increases for agency-oriented consumers, who tend to maximize their own self-interests. However, for communion-oriented consumers, who generally consider the needs of others, brand humanization increases perceived fairness of both price increases and decreases. Furthermore, because consumers' focus on the self versus others also depends on relationship goals, the nature of consumer?brand relationships interacts with agency?communion orientation to influence the effect of brand humanization on perceived price fairness. For example, exchange relationship norms reduce the power of brand anthropomorphization to enhance perceived fairness of price changes for communion-oriented consumers. In contrast, the communal nature of these relationships makes both agency- and communion-oriented consumers infer greater positive intent from a humanized (vs. nonhumanized) brand, thus leading to a more positive effect of brand humanization on price fairness for price decreases.",0
Buyer Monitoring: A Means to Insure Personalized Service,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Marketing scholars have proposed that service employees play a primary role in delivering service quality. However, the question of how to motivate service employees to enhance service production has received little research attention. The authors address this gap by advocating a control mechanism first discussed in the economics literature?buyer monitoring. The authors focus on a pervasive form of buyer monitoring, voluntary tipping, and examine the effectiveness of this control mechanism as a means for improving service in two contexts: leisure cruises and restaurant dining. Despite a substantial interdisciplinary literature reporting a weak relationship between customers' perceptions of service and their tipping behavior, the results show that a policy of voluntary tipping has positive effects on the motivation and behavior of service workers and on customers' perceptions of the service those workers provide. These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for motivating service employees. The findings also call into question trends away from tipping in service contexts, such as the cruise industry, and suggest that many service businesses for which tipping is not viable can benefit from alternative forms of buyer monitoring.",1
When Remembering Disrupts Knowing: Blocking Implicit Price Memory,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Does explicit recall help or hurt memory-based comparisons? It is often assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should facilitate?or at least not disrupt?memory-based comparisons. Using the domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so. Attempting?and failing at?explicit price recall focuses attention on metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory blocking?metacognitive memory blocking?in which the feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memory during judgments. They also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference price.",1
Sensitivity to National Business Culture: Effects on U.S.-Mexican Channel Relationship Performance,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"The need to be sensitive to foreign cultures is often stated axiomatically in the international marketing management literature despite little empirical research on its nature and consequences. To partially fill this void, this field investigation addresses empirically the question of the effects of sensitivity to national business culture on communication, conflict, and performance in cross-national channel relationships. Data collected from 142 U.S. manufacturers, 104 Mexican manufacturers, and 96 Mexican distributors reveal that the sensitivity axiom can be supported empirically. Specifically, partner sensitivity to national business culture is shown to increase communication and decrease conflict, both of which in turn influence relationship performance. Implications for cross-national channel relationships are discussed.",0
The Orientation-Matching Hypothesis: An Emotion-Specificity Approach to Affect Regulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article proposes that merely considering outcomes associated with a positive approach emotion (e.g., happiness) can regulate negative emotions that evoke an approach orientation (e.g., sadness, anger). In contrast, outcomes associated with a positive avoidance emotion (e.g., calmness) best regulate negative emotions that evoke an avoidance orientation (e.g., anxiety, embarrassment). Although such orientation-matched (versus mismatched) positive outcomes might not address the problem that caused the negative emotion, they automatically signal a reduced need for affect regulation specific to the evoked orientation. Thus, orientation matching results in emotional benefit, increases preferences toward matched outcomes, and frees resources for subsequent tasks.",1
Bringing Export Performance Metrics into Annual Reports: The APEV Scale and the PERFEX Scorecard,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Annual company reports rarely distinguish between domestic and export market performance and even more rarely provide information about annual indicators of a specific export venture's performance. In this study, the authors develop and test a new measure for assessing the annual performance of an export venture (the APEV scale). The new measure comprises five dimensions: (1) annual export venture financial performance, (2) annual export venture strategic performance, (3) annual export venture achievement, (4) contribution of the export venture to annual exporting operations, and (5) satisfaction with annual export venture overall performance. The authors use the APEV scale to generate a scorecard of performance in exporting (the PERFEX scorecard) to assess export performance at the corporate level while comparatively evaluating all export ventures of the firm. Both the scale and the scorecard could help disclose export venture performance and could be useful instruments for annual planning, management, monitoring, and improvement of exporting programs.",0
The STEP Scale: A Measure of Short-Term Export Performance Improvement,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This article is a direct response to a recent observation in the literature that managers appear to be short-term oriented in their assessment of the performance of an export venture (Madsen 1998). On the basis of a cross-national survey of exporting firms, the authors present a three-dimensional scale for assessing managerial judgment of short-term export performance (i.e., the STEP scale). The three dimensions are (1) satisfaction with short-term performance improvement, (2) short-term exporting intensity improvement, and (3) expected short-term performance improvement. The scale presents evidence of reliability as well as convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity, and it reveals factorial similarity and factorial equivalence across both samples. The authors outline managerial and public policy implications that stem from the scale and identify avenues for further export marketing research.",0
"Relationship Capabilities, Quality, and Innovation as Determinants of Export Performance",Journal of International Marketing,2009,"The authors employ a resource-based view perspective to understand how a set of capabilities (organizational learning, relationship, and quality capabilities) influences product strategy (product quality and product innovation) and export performance (relationship performance and economic performance). Using two types of respondents from the same firm, they find strong support for the capability?strategy?performance link. The results indicate that managers should invest in relationship management capabilities to improve product innovation and product quality, which in turn leads to export performance enhancement. Furthermore, the findings reveal that though product quality is a critical aspect in international markets, both product innovation and relationship performance play a greater role in enhancing economic performance. The authors conclude with implications for international marketing theory and practice.",0
The Aha! Experience: Insight and Discontinuous Learning in Product Usage,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Success of many products depends on how consumers learn to use them. This research suggests that initial product trial may lead to jumps in consumer learning. Such discontinuities in learning co-occur with the experience of insight?namely, a better conceptual understanding of how to use the product. Notably, such learning also positively affects downstream outcomes such as affect and usage intentions. Whereas exploration during initial trial facilitates insight-based learning, usage instructions seem to limit this type of learning. The implication for marketing managers is to structure initial trials in a manner conducive to exploration, thus leading to insight-driven learning and the associated positive outcomes.",0
The Effects of Cultural Values in Word-of-Mouth Communication,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"When new products and brands are introduced into other cultures, the speed and extent of the product's acceptance are important concerns for marketers. The spread of positive word of mouth (WOM) and the lack of negative WOM about the product or brand by early adopter groups are critical to the product's successful diffusion in a population. This is the first study to investigate the effects of consumers? cultural values on their WOM behavior. Data analysis from two samples indicates that the pattern, type, and target receivers of consumers? WOM activity depend on their cultural values. The authors use Hofstede's four cultural dimensions to test the effects of cultural values on WOM behavior to social in- and out-groups. They find that all four dimensions have significant effects on WOM engagement to those groups. Although the authors could not determine the causal nature of the relationships because of the sample design used, they argue that marketers should monitor the cultural values of their market to anticipate in- and out-group discussions and the choice of appropriate brand communication strategies in other countries.",0
Resistance to Brand Switching when a Radically New Brand is Introduced: A Social Identity Theory Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2010,"There has been little research on how market disruptions affect customer?brand relationships and how firms can sustain brand loyalty when disruptions occur. Drawing from social identity theory and the brand loyalty literature, the authors propose a conceptual framework to examine these issues in a specific market disruption, namely, the introduction of a radically new brand. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers? identification with and perceived value of the incumbent relative to the new brand on switching behavior. The authors divert from the conventional economic perspective of treating brand switching as functional utility maximization to propose that brand switching can also result from customers? social mobility between brand identities. The results from longitudinal data of 679 customers during the launch of the iPhone in Spain show that both relative customer?brand identification and relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. Relative customer?brand identification with the incumbent apparently exerts a stronger longitudinal restraint on switching behavior than relative perceived value of the incumbent. The study has important strategic implications for devising customer relationship strategies and brand investment.",0
The Diffusion of Market Orientation Throughout the Organization: A Social Learning Theory Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This study examines the diffusion of market orientation (MO) as a social learning process to acquire and transfer individual-level MO. Central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or envoys. Through their market-oriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups?formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. In turn, these observers become top managers? envoys and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. Empirical results from a three-level data set from a Fortune 500 company support this perspective. While envoys who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. Network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. By identifying who the important work-group envoys are and under what conditions certain envoys are likely to be most effective, this study helps managers select the best envoys to implement MO.",0
Why do Older Consumers Buy Older Brands? The Role of Attachment and Declining Innovativeness,Journal of Marketing,2010,"The authors compare three mechanisms that may explain why older consumers tend to prefer older brands. Data are from the French perfume market, in which some market leaders are decades old while hundreds of new entrants launch yearly. The authors reveal monotonically increasing differences across age ranges. Younger consumers have a greater propensity to change their preferred brand, a form of innovativeness that benefits relatively recent entrants, whereas older consumers exhibit a propensity to remain attached for a longer duration to the same preferred brand. Nostalgia for options encountered during an early ?formative period? has only a limited impact. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity emerges: At all ages, some consumers frequently change their preferred brand, whereas others remain attached to it for long periods. It is the proportion of these two behaviors that varies across age ranges. The resultant managerial implications indicate that mature consumers are attractive targets because they likely remain attached to a brand longer, that long-established products may still attract new consumers, and that the success of a new brand among young consumers may be ephemeral.",0
Repeat Purchasing of New Automobiles by Older Consumers: Empirical Evidence and Interpretations,Journal of Marketing,2005,"In a large empirical study, the authors find that older consumers, who constitute an important market segment, repurchase a brand more frequently when they buy a new car. Older consumers consider fewer brands, fewer dealers, and fewer models, and they choose long-established brands more often. To interpret the results, the authors rely on four age-related theoretical perspectives: biological aging, cognitive decline, socioemotional selectivity, and change aversion.",0
"A Thematic Exploration of Digital, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing: Research Evolution from 2000 to 2015 and an Agenda for Future Inquiry",Journal of Marketing,2016,"Over the past 15 years, digital media platforms have revolutionized marketing, offering new ways to reach, inform, engage, sell to, learn about, and provide service to customers. As a means of taking stock of academic work's ability to contribute to this revolution, this article tracks the changes in scholarly researchers? perspectives on three major digital, social media, and mobile (DSMM) marketing themes from 2000 to 2015. The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000. They then identify key themes emerging in five-year time frames during this period: (1) DSMM as a facilitator of individual expression, (2) DSMM as decision support tool, and (3) DSMM as a market intelligence source. In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice.

When is Ours Better than Mine? A Framework for Understanding and Altering Participation in Commercial Sharing Systems,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Sharing systems are increasingly challenging sole ownership as the dominant means of obtaining product benefits, making up a market estimated at more than US$100 billion annually in 2010. Consumer options include cell phone minute-sharing plans, frequent-flyer-mile pools, bicycle-sharing programs, and automobile-sharing systems, among many others. However, marketing research has yet to provide a framework for understanding and managing these emergent systems. The authors conceptualize commercial sharing systems within a typology of shared goods. Using three studies, they demonstrate that beyond cost-related benefits of sharing, the perceived risk of scarcity related to sharing is a central determinant of its attractiveness. The results suggest that managers can use perceptions of personal and sharing partners? usage patterns to affect risk perceptions and subsequent propensity to participate in a commercial sharing system.",0
Paying with Money or Effort: Pricing When Customers Anticipate Hassle,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"For many services, customers subscribe to long-term contracts. Standard economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level, customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the contract?for example, due to ?hassle costs.? If customers use period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract. They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic discounting. The findings suggest that in setting prices, firms should consider the timing of hassle costs customers face.",1
When Does Retargeting Work? Information Specificity in Online Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.",1
How Business Cycles Contribute to Private-Label Success: Evidence from the United States and Europe,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The growth of private labels over the past decades has been attributed to various factors. This article formally addresses the link between private-label success and economic expansions and contractions using recently developed time-series/econometric techniques. The findings confirm conventional wisdom that a country's private-label share increases when the economy is suffering and shrinks when the economy is flourishing. However, asymmetries are found in the extent to and speed with which private-label share changes in cyclical up- versus downturns. Consumers switch more extensively to store brands during bad economic times than they switch back to national brands in a subsequent recovery. In addition, the switch to private-label brands is faster than the opposite movement to national brands after the recession ends. Finally, not only are consumers more prone to buy private labels during economic downturns, but some keep buying them when bad economic times are long over as well, leaving permanent ?scars? on national brands? performance level. The authors argue that national-brand manufacturers can mitigate the effect of an economic downturn on their shares by intensifying their marketingsupport activities in recessions. Such a proactive strategy is not often observed. On the contrary, available evidence suggests that many manufacturers exacerbate their predicament by cutting back on their marketing expenses when the economy turns sour. Most retailers invest more strongly in their private-label program when the economy deteriorates, making it even more difficult for national brands to catch up with the share lost during contractions.",0
The Effect of Business-Cycle Fluctuations on Private-Label Share: What has Marketing Conduct Got to do with it?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors investigate whether, and to what extent, marketing conduct varies over the business cycle and how this contributes to the growing popularity of private labels. To address this issue, they examine a unique data set that combines a broad set of seven marketing-mix instruments with private-label share, using two decades' worth of data for 106 consumer packaged goods categories in the United States. The results show that private-label share behaves countercyclically and that part of the boost in private-label share during contractions is permanent. Retailers' observed practice of supporting their own labels in contraction periods while cutting back in expansion periods helps this cyclical sensitivity even further. In addition, national brands' procyclical behavior in terms of (1) major new product introductions, (2) advertising, and (3) their promotional pressure compared with private labels is associated with more pronounced cyclical fluctuations in private-label share and even with permanent private-label market share gains. Although brand managers cannot be held responsible for the occurrence of economic downswings, they can be held accountable for how much contractions help strengthen their fiercest competitor, the store brands owned by their very customers.",0
Multihoming in Two-Sided Markets: An Empirical Inquiry in the Video Game Console Industry,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. The authors focus on multihoming?the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.",0
"The Commercial Consequences of Collective Layoffs: Close the Plant, Lose the Brand?",Journal of Marketing,2020,"This article examines the effects of collective layoff announcements on sales and marketing-mix elasticities, accounting for supply-side constraints. The authors study 205 announcements in the automotive industry using a difference-in-differences model. They find that, following collective layoff announcements, layoff firms experience adverse changes in sales, advertising elasticity, and price elasticity. They explore the moderating role of announcement characteristics on these changes and find that collective layoff announcements by domestic firms and announcements that do not mention a decline in demand as a motive are more likely to be followed by adverse marketing-mix elasticity changes. On average, sales for the layoff firm in the layoff country are 8.7% lower following a collective layoff announcement than their predicted levels absent the announcement. Similarly, advertising elasticity is 9.8% lower and price elasticity is 19.2% higher than absent the announcement. Conversely, layoff firms typically decrease advertising spending in the country where collective layoffs have occurred, yet they do not change prices. These findings are relevant to marketing managers of firms undergoing collective layoffs and to analysts of collective layoff decisions.",0
It's Got the Look: The Effect of Friendly and Aggressive ?Facial? Expressions on Product Liking and Sales,Journal of Marketing,2011,"When designing their products, companies try to employ shapes that are both emotionally appealing and compatible with the brand's image. One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional ?facial? expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category.",0
Product Design for the Long Run: Consumer Responses to Typical and Atypical Designs at Different Stages of Exposure,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Extant research on product design has suggested that a design's typicality is an important determinant of consumers' aesthetic liking. Yet most studies to date have measured consumers' reactions to designs of varied typicality after a single exposure. In reality, however, consumers usually have multiple opportunities to observe a product before making a decision. Against this background, the authors perform three studies in the automobile domain that examine whether the positive effect of design typicality is moderated by the level of exposure. Study 1 indicates that aesthetic liking of typical car designs is greater at lower exposure levels, whereas people like atypical car designs better at higher exposure levels. Study 2 uses real sales data and indicates that the interaction between design typicality and exposure also affects sales, suggesting that atypical cars may be more successful in the long run. Using experimental manipulations of the key constructs, Study 3 provides evidence for the underlying process and finds renewed support for the notion that design typicality and exposure interact to affect aesthetic liking.",0
The Impact of Ad Repetition and Ad Content on Consumer Perceptions of Incongruent Extensions,Journal of Marketing,2000,"The author challenges the view that incongruent extensions are doomed to fail and demonstrates that brand extension ad content and repeated exposure to those advertisements influence consumer reactions to incongruent extensions. In a study of four highly regarded brands, participants who viewed brand extension advertisements five times evaluated incongruent extensions more positively, expressed higher usage intentions, indicated more favorable consistency judgments, and exhibited increased elaboration and more positive elaboration than did participants who viewed the advertisements only once. This relationship was attenuated for highly incongruent extensions, for which the advertisement evoked primarily peripheral brand associations instead of benefit brand associations. However, for moderately incongruent extensions, advertisements that evoked either peripheral or benefit associations were equally effective. Process measures indicate the importance of the extent and nature of elaborative processing.",0
Climb or Jump: Status-Based Seeding in User-Generated Content Networks,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article addresses seeding policies in user-generated content networks by challenging the role of influencers in a setting of unpaid endorsements. On such platforms, the content is generated by individuals and firms interested in self-promotion. The authors use data from a worldwide leading music platform to study unknown music creators who aim to increase exposure of their content by expanding their follower base through directing outbound activities to other users. The authors find that the responsiveness of seeding targets strongly declines with status difference; thus, unknown music creators (the majority) do not generally benefit at all from seeding influencers. Instead, they should gradually build their status by targeting low-status users rather than attempt to ?jump? by targeting high-status ones. This research extends the seeding literature by introducing the concept of risk to dissemination dynamics in online communications, showing that unknown music creators do not seed specific status levels but rather choose a portfolio of seeding targets while solving a risk versus return trade-off. The authors discuss various managerial implications for optimal seeding in user-generated content networks.",1
Exploring the Differences between Conscious and Unconscious Goal Pursuit,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"People can be aware (conscious) or unaware (unconscious) of an active goal when making a choice. Being aware of a goal enables people to use conscious strategies to identify attributes that are relevant to goal pursuit and to assess the efficacy of the attributes of each choice alternative. For most people, this process encourages the choice of the most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal, and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the alternative that is most efficacious for the goal. The authors investigate these processes by manipulating the conscious system's ability to assess the efficacy of product attributes and the unconscious system's ability to match the accessible goal to product attributes.",1
An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Uncertainty in Marketing Promotions Involving Free Gifts,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The authors provide a framework to predict when uncertainty will have a beneficial or detrimental impact on marketing promotions involving free gifts. Whereas uncertainty (i.e., not knowing which free gift will be offered) decreases purchase likelihood when the decision is cognitive, it increases purchase likelihood when the decision is affective. Using field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that when the decision involves affect, people like to be surprised and appreciate uncertainty in the purchase process. When the decision is cognitive, consumers appreciate having information about the product offer. This research has both theoretical implications for research on affect and uncertainty and practical implications for marketing managers designing and implementing promotional campaigns.",0
"Modeling Heterogeneity in the Satisfaction, Loyalty Intention, and Shareholder Value Linkage: A Cross-Industry Analysis at the Customer and Firm Levels",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This study examines the relationship between customer satisfaction, loyalty intention, and shareholder value at the firm and individual customer levels. The authors also explore industry differences by using a multilevel and random-effects approach in which individual customer scores are nested within firm-level data and the estimated interrelationships are treated as random coefficients that are explained by industry characteristics. They compile a unique and detailed data set, which covers 10 years of information on 137 firms and includes a matched sample of 189,069 customers from multiple sources, such as the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the Center for Research in Security Prices, and Compustat, to yield three important insights. First, aggregate firm-level effects may overestimate the impact that satisfaction has at the individual customer level. Second, a consideration of loyalty intention or repurchase intention as the mediator can improve our understanding of the satisfaction?shareholder value relationship and the fact that this relationship can vary across firms. Finally, the influence of satisfaction and loyalty intentions on shareholder value varies by industry. The authors discuss implications of findings for researchers, managers, and investors.",1
Service Quality Perceptions and Customer Satisfaction: Evaluating the Role of Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"The authors examine the influence of culture on the measurement of service quality and satisfaction in dentists? office settings. Respondents from the United States, Canada, and Japan participated in a 2 ? 2 factorial experiment in which the authors manipulated both expectations (high/low) and service performance (high/low) in a series of scenarios. With partial metric invariance, latent mean comparisons revealed that regardless of expectations, Japanese respondents reported lower quality perceptions and satisfaction ratings when performance was high and higher satisfaction ratings when performance was low than did their U.S. and Canadian counterparts. Thus, there is some evidence that Japanese consumers are more conservative in their evaluations of superior service but are less critical (or more forgiving) of inferior service. The authors also discuss managerial implications and future research directions.",0
Export Opportunities in a Crumbling Economy: The Soviet Union in 1990,Journal of International Marketing,1993,Economic liberalization is underway in many countries that had previously been relatively closed to outside commercial relations. This includes former East Bloc nations and LDCs that had long attempted to protect their inefficient industries from foreign competition. Perhaps the most spectacular example of this trend is the former Soviet Union. This article reports a study of the changes that occurred in the former Soviet Union's trade relations with non-communist countries in the critical period during which trade ?openness? was being established. The results provide insights that may be useful to exporters in their assessment of market opportunities in countries undergoing the difficult transition to a market economy.,0
When Budgeting Backfires: How Self-Imposed Price Restraints Can Increase Spending,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not imposed a price restraint.",1
"When Promoting Similarity Slows Satiation: The Relationship of Variety, Categorization, Similarity, and Satiation",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Satiation is an ongoing marketing challenge as it continually reduces a consumer's ability to enjoy a favored experience. The prevailing notion is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible. We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across all stimuli. Five studies establish this finding across multiple domains (music, art, and food) and provide process evidence that an ad hoc categorization for the overall experience underlies our effect. Our theory and findings provide insight into how and when similarity can help or hinder satiation, and they clarify the role of ad hoc categorization in this relationship.",1
A Strategic Model for Multinational Corporation Social Responsibility in the Third World,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Frequent criticism of multinational corporation social responsibility is contrasted with the ?Friedman Doctrine,? which maintains that the social responsibility of business is to increase profits. A general framework recognizing that the long-range purpose of exchange is the mutual satisfaction of the interests of all parties leads to a discussion of concepts from Blau's exchange structuralism. A structural model for enhancing multinational corporation strategy for socially responsible exchange behavior with developing nations is introduced.",0
Can Repeating a Brand Claim Lead to Memory Confusion? The Effects of Claim Similarity and Concurrent Repetition,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Repetition of brand claims is frequently used to promote the learning of brand-related information. Using dual component models of recognition memory, the author examines whether repetition, in the face of repetitions by similar competitors, might paradoxically increase memory confusion. In Experiment 1, the repetition of similar claims of equally familiar competitor brands produced two opposing effects: It increased memory for accurate claim recognition but also elevated brand claim confusion among advertised competitors. The pattern of results was similar when memory was tested a week after the initial exposure. In Experiment 2, in which participants were required to engage in a task designed to promote the ?binding? between a brand and its claim, the memory confusion effects of repetition were significantly reduced. Finally, Experiment 3 replicated and generalized these findings by using more realistic stimuli and procedures. Thus, across three studies, the evidence strongly suggests that the confusion-elevating effects of repetition are a result of weak binding between memory for brand and claims.",1
Multichannel Strategies for Managing the Profitability of Business-to-Business Customers,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"As business-to-business customers increasingly use online channels, sellers must reconsider strategic investments in at least two areas: the salesperson channel, which faces the threat of substitution, and customer-specific discounts, which may be more precisely targeted. The authors draw on communication theory to posit that a customer?s search and purchasing in the seller?s online channels interact positively with both salesperson contact and customer-specific discounts to drive the seller?s customer-level sales and profit return on these investments. A multimethod approach using a complex data set from a large industrial seller provides broad support for hypothesized effects. Two post hoc experiments reveal how online and salesperson channels are complementary, together improving customer?seller communication such that the seller is better able to fulfill customer needs and reduce customer perceived risk. This research advances the multichannel and pricing literatures and offers actionable insights for business-to-business marketers, revealing how online channels can complement traditional seller investments in salespeople and customer-specific discounts.",1
Salesperson Dual Agency in Price Negotiations,Journal of Marketing,2020,"When should business-to-business firms encourage their salespeople to advocate for the customer in pricing negotiations? This research extends dual agency theory to the sales domain to address this question. In Study 1, the authors examine discount negotiations with secondary data from a major U.S. distributor. They find that the customer and seller both experience the most favorable outcomes when the salesperson advocates strongly for both parties; advocacy for either party alone is counterproductive. Study 2 confirms these results using matched survey, pricing, and profit data and demonstrates a key boundary condition: broad customer?seller ties enable the synergy between customer advocacy and seller advocacy by enhancing the firms? abilities to monitor the salesperson. In Study 3, experiments with business-to-business buyers replicate key findings and provide evidence for theorized mechanisms. This research emphasizes the interdependence between the salesperson?s dual roles and demonstrates how the salesperson can serve as an effective agent of both the customer and seller, thereby mitigating challenges associated with role conflict.",0
Executive Insights: Changing Dimensions of International Marketing Management?The New Realities,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"International marketing is now in the midst of a major transformation that, in the next 15 to 20 years, will reshape and restructure concepts, approaches, and operations. International marketing management thinking may well be turned upside down, as fundamental precepts are challenged, a new mindset evolves, and marketing's international thrust comes of age. International concerns will move to the forefront of business, with government and societal issues transforming the management of marketing activities. The author offers some perspectives on the future of international marketing practices based on some current trends.",0
Executive Insights: Global Marketing Management: At the Dawn of the New Millennium,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Dramatic global economic changes are under way at the dawn of the new millennium, such as the new Euro currency, Asian economic downturn, instantaneous flows of capital, new global conglomerates, and the growth of the Internet. These changes will have a profound impact on global marketing management, including increasing risk and uncertainty, real-time information management, and rapid response to global developments. Cross-impact analysis will become a more important tool for dealing with uncertain interactions among complex forces. The managerial mindset will have to grasp the big picture, think outside the box, discount the present to create the future, and move far beyond benchmarking. This will lead to changes in decision-making orientations, including a shift from relatively stable environments and mechanistic management approaches to more turbulent environments and systemic management approaches and a shift from hard facts for solving problems to virtual facts for problem prevention.",0
Discount Rates for Time versus Dates: The Sensitivity of Discounting to Time-Interval Description,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Six experiments examine the impact of time-interval descriptions on consumers' discount rates. Consumers exhibit more discounting (e.g., they demand more money to delay income) when delay intervals are described by extents of time than when delay intervals are described by dates. This pattern holds in various contexts, including gains and losses, and is robust to response-mode changes. Findings further indicate that this effect may arise because, compared with date descriptions, extent descriptions enhance perceptions of interval length. The author discusses other potential mechanisms and implications.",1
Branding Alters Attitude Functions and Reduces the Advantage of Function-Matching Persuasive Appeals,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Attitudes differ in terms of the functions they serve: Whereas attitudes toward some products may serve a utilitarian purpose of helping consumers maximize rewards, attitudes toward other products may symbolize or express consumers? values. This article shows that branding alters the associations between products and attitude functions. Specifically, product categories that are generally associated with utilitarian attitudes are associated with less utilitarian, more symbolic attitudes when branded, whereas product categories that are generally associated with symbolic attitudes are associated with more utilitarian, less symbolic attitudes when branded. Branding also has important implications for persuasion and for the ?function-matching? advantage: Although utilitarian appeals are most persuasive for ?utilitarian? products (and symbolic appeals are most persuasive for ?symbolic? products) at the category level, this article shows that this pattern does not emerge at the brand level, in part because attitude functions change with branding.",1
Forceful Phantom Firsts: Framing Experiences as Firsts Amplifies Their Influence on Judgment,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"First experiences are highly influential. Here, the authors show that nonfirst experiences can be made to seem like firsts and, consequently, to have a disproportionate influence on judgment. In six experiments, one piece of a series of information was framed to appear to have ?first? status: For example, a weather report that appeared at the end of a sequence of weather reports happened to correspond to the first day of a vacation, and a customer review that appeared at the end of a sequence of hotel reviews happened to be the new year's first review. Such information had greater influence on subsequent judgments (e.g., of the next day's weather, of the hotel's quality) than identical information not framed as a first. This effect seems to arise largely because ?phantom first? pieces of information receive greater weight, but not necessarily more attention, than other pieces of information.",1
Effects of Implicit Memory on Memory-Based versus Stimulus-Based Brand Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The author introduces implicit (versus explicit) memory to examine advertising effects on brand choice. Whereas explicit memory is demonstrated by the conscious recollection of an event, implicit memory is inferred by an improvement in some task performance as the result of having experienced the event. This research shows that memory-based choice benefits from advertising that enhances conceptually driven implicit memory whereas stimulus-based choice benefits from advertising that enhances perceptually driven implicit memory. The findings provide evidence that the two types of implicit memory and explicit memory are distinct constructs of memory; the findings also suggest that implicit memory measures may be more useful indicators of advertising effectiveness than explicit memory measures.",1
The Effect of Conceptual and Perceptual Fluency on Brand Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"According to the processing fluency model, advertising exposures enhance the ease with which consumers recognize and process a brand. In turn, this increased perceptual fluency leads to consumers having more favorable attitudes toward the brand. The authors extend the processing fluency model to examine the effect of conceptual fluency on attitudes. In three experiments, the authors show that when a target comes to mind more readily and becomes conceptually fluent, as when it is presented in a predictive context (e.g., a bottle of beer featured in an advertisement that shows a man entering a bar) or when it is primed by a related construct (e.g., an image of ketchup following an advertisement of mayonnaise), participants develop more favorable attitudes toward the target. It is believed that positive valence of fluent processing underlies these processing-fluency effects. When conceptual fluency is associated with negative valence (e.g., hair conditioner primed by a lice-killing shampoo), the authors observe less favorable attitudes.",1
"Fear, Social Projection, and Financial Decision Making",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The number of individual investors who trade stocks online has significantly increased in recent years. Surprisingly, consumer researchers have paid little attention to how emotions influence individual investors? stock-trading decisions. In a series of three experiments, the authors investigate the impact of incidental fear on the decision to sell in a stock market simulation. The results show that fearful (vs. control) participants sell their stock earlier (Experiments 1?3). This effect, however, is contingent on particular features of the market. Fear leads to early sell-off when parti-pant believe the value of the stock is peer generated but not when they believe the value of the stock is computer generated (Experiment 2). Early sell-off as a result of incidental fear also occurs when participants believe their risk attitude is common in the market but not when they believe their risk attitude is unique (Experiment 3). Social projection?that is, people's tendency to rely on their current state of mind to estimate other people's actions?explains the phenomenon.",1
Executive Insights: The Korean Automobile Industry?Challenges and Strategies in the Global Market,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"This article deals with the current challenges and future strategies for the Korean automobile industry in the global market. To understand its strengths and weaknesses, the trends of the world market for motor vehicles and the development of the Korean automobile industry are discussed. In the first part, Korea's automobile production in the world market is examined. A brief overview of the production and consumption of automobiles is provided along with a description of the four-stage development of Korean car production. In the second part, various forces of production are identified that affect Korean automakers? competitiveness in the global market. Capital formation, labor relations, the role of government, management style, production technology, research and development, and workmanship are discussed briefly. Finally, in light of current observations, some of the challenges for the Korean automobile industry in the future are pointed out and some recommendations for automakers, labor, and the government are offered.",0
"Guanxi, Trust, and Long-Term Orientation in Chinese Business Markets",Journal of International Marketing,2005,"This research focuses on buying firms? trust in a supplier's salesperson and posits that this type of trust is determined by characteristics of the salesperson, the interpersonal relationships between a salesperson and the buying firm's boundary personnel, and characteristics of personal interactions between these two parties. More important, the authors discuss the concept of interpersonal relationships in the context of Chinese culture and model it as a three-dimensional latent construct, which, in some literature, is called guanxi. A key aspect of this research is that the authors investigate the impact of each dimension of guanxi on salesperson trust separately. Moreover, the authors consider the buying firm's trust in the supplying firm and its long-term orientation toward the supplier the consequences of salesperson trust. To test the model, the authors use data collected from 128 buying organizations in Hong Kong. The sampled firms are from both the government and private sectors.",0
Are Consumer Survey Results Distorted? Systematic Impact of Behavioral Frequency and Duration on Survey Response Errors,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Using a large-scale consumer database created by AT&T, the authors investigate how actual behavioral frequency and duration systematically affect the direction of errors in consumer survey responses. By analyzing errors in consumers' reports on their frequency of using long-distance telephone calls, letters, cards, and visits for personal communication, the authors demonstrate that high-frequency groups underreported their behavioral frequencies, whereas low-frequency groups overreported them. Similarly, the results show that consumers underestimate the duration of lengthy telephone conversations, whereas they overestimate the duration of short ones. Overall, the authors find that people tend to overestimate both frequency and duration. These compressive regressive effects toward the mean and overall upward bias for both frequency and duration estimations result in a distorted view of the market, which will be incorrectly perceived to be more homogeneous and larger than it really is.",1
Price No Object!: The Impact of Power Distance Belief on Consumers? Price Sensitivity,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The role of culture in consumers? price search and behavior has received limited attention in the literature. In the present research, the authors examine how the cultural dimension of power distance belief (PDB)?the extent to which people accept and endorse hierarchy?influences consumers? price sensitivity. The authors propose that consumers high (vs. low) in PDB are less price sensitive because they have a higher need for closure, which motivates them to ?seize and freeze? on a current offer and quickly arrive at the final purchase decision rather than search for a better price. Accordingly, the relationship between PDB and price sensitivity is moderated by variables that alter consumers? need for closure, such as social density. Six studies (and five more summarized in the Web Appendices) using a variety of operationalizations of the key variables provide robust support for the relationship between PDB and price sensitivity and shed light on the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.",0
Disposition Effects and Underlying Mechanisms in E-Trading of Stocks,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"People have a tendency to sell stocks more quickly if their value has increased since the time they were purchased than if their value has decreased during this period. This ?disposition effect? can sometimes have negative financial consequences. Based on an analysis of transaction data in a simulated trading environment, Study 1 provides evidence of the disposition effect in a newly emerging Internet-based stock trading (?e-trading?) situation. Three laboratory studies then examine the mechanisms that underlie the effect. The magnitude of the disposition effect is unaffected by experimental manipulations of the subjective likelihood of future gains or losses. However, it is eliminated by inducing participants to define gains and losses in similar subjective units. Furthermore, the effect depends on whether participants make selling decisions on their own stocks or serve as an agent for someone else. Thus, the disposition effect is largely a result of differences in the subjective value that participants attach to possible gains and losses rather than of differences in their beliefs that these outcomes will occur. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.",1
Social Comparison in Retailer?Supplier Relationships: Referent Discrepancy Effects,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Social comparisons among suppliers connected through a common retailer pose significant management challenges for the retailer. For instance, a focal supplier?s social comparison can result in upward or downward referent discrepancy, decreasing or increasing perceptions of distributive fairness, respectively, subject to the tie strength of the relationship. Because decreasing perceptions of distributive fairness can be harmful to the retailer?supplier relationship, the authors examine the use of tie strength and timing of explanations as actions a retailer can take to mitigate such perceptions. They test their hypotheses with a two-study, multimethod design conducted in Japan. Study 1 employs a survey of suppliers in a store-within-a-store context as well as objective performance data. The results indicate that upward (downward) referent discrepancy decreases (increases) a focal supplier?s perceptions of distributive fairness. Study 2 employs an experiment using brand/store managers. The results show that when upward referent discrepancies are present, retailers can mitigate the invidious effects of decreased perceptions of distributive fairness by developing strong ties and enacting procedurally fair policies such as proactively providing explanations.",0
The Balancing of Country-Based Interaction Orientation and Marketing Strategy Implementation Adaptation/Standardization for Profit Growth in Multinational Corporations,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"For business success and continued growth, multinational corporations (MNCs) must work to efficiently leverage interactions with customers dispersed across geographic boundaries. Under the framework of the attention-based view, this study examines the MNC strategic approach of country-based interaction orientation and marketing strategy implementation adaptation/standardization as drivers of global profit growth, contingent on the environmental conditions of competitive intensity and market dynamism. The findings from a survey of U.S.-based MNCs indicate that managerial attention focused on country-based interaction orientation and marketing strategy implementation standardization, when considered jointly, have a positive effect on MNC profit growth. The findings also show that the effect of a country-based interaction orientation on MNC profit growth is not as susceptible to competitive intensity and market dynamism when MNCs standardize their marketing strategy implementation, but it varies when MNCs take a more adapted approach to their implementation strategies across country markets. These findings bring to light important implications for international marketing theory and practice.",0
The Alignment of Contract Terms for Knowledge-Creating and Knowledge-Appropriating Relationship Portfolios,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Interfirm collaborative relationships for developing new products involve the two fundamental tasks of creating new knowledge and appropriating the newly created or current stocks of knowledge. This study examines the alignment of two contract terms?form of resource integration (how partners integrate their resources) and form of equity sharing (whether partners are engaged in equity investment)?for knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios. By analyzing interfirm relationship agreements initiated in the pharmaceutical industry between 1990 and 2006, the author shows that knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios benefit from different alignments of contract terms to address their unique concerns. The author also shows that the appropriate alignments of contract terms are more critical for small firms than for large firms. The results provide specific insights into the management of knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios for developing a greater number of radical and incremental new products.",0
The Strength of Weak-Tie Consensus Language,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Every day, consumers share word of mouth (WOM) on how products and behaviors are commonly adopted through the use of consensus language. Consensus language refers to words and expressions that suggest general agreement among a group of people regarding an opinion, product, or behavior (e.g., ?everyone likes this movie?). In a series of online and field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using consensus language. The authors theorize and demonstrate that this effect occurs because weak ties evoke perceptions of a larger and more diverse group in consensus, which signals greater validity for the issue at hand. These findings contribute to research on WOM, tie strength, and descriptive norms and provide practical implications for marketers on ways to analyze and encourage consumer discourse.",1
A Multiple Ideal Point Model: Capturing Multiple Preference Effects from within an Ideal Point Framework,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Previous research has suggested that households and individuals may possess multiple preferences for a given product category. These multiple preferences may be the result of multiple individuals in a household, different uses and usage occasions, and/or variety seeking. As such, single ideal point models that assume a single invariant ideal point may be operating from a false and misleading assumption. We propose a multiple ideal point model to capture these multiple preference effects. The basic premise of the model is that consumers may possess a set of ideal points, each of which represents a distinct preference. At any given purchase occasion, one of these points is ?activated? with some probability, and choices are made with respect to its characteristics. In this article, the authors assess the multiple ideal point model and an associated estimation procedure with respect to the model's ability to recover a true choice structure. The authors then empirically test the model on Information Resources Inc. panel data from the powdered soft drink category. The authors discuss the results and introduce directions for further research.",1
Can McDonald's Food Ever be Considered Healthful? Metacognitive Experiences Affect the Perceived Understanding of a Brand,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Consumers use metacognitive experiences to draw inferences about the state of their brand understanding but only when these metacognitive experiences are relevant for making this inference. In such situations, metacognitive difficulty can improve brand evaluations because it triggers efforts to restore brand understanding by seizing on available new information.",1
"Trading Favors for Marketing Advantage: Evidence from Hong Kong, China, and the United States",Journal of International Marketing,2005,"This study examines the risk-taking paradigm in the context of international marketing activities. It explores the causes of questionable business practices of Hong Kong executives in international marketing activities and further substantiates the findings with two replication samples (i.e., Mainland Chinese executives and U.S. executives). The authors find that the nature of the corruption proposal and the operating business environment affect Hong Kong executives? risk-taking behavior (i.e., risk recognition, risk adjustment, and risky choice). The behaviors of Mainland Chinese executives and U.S. executives show a different picture. Developmental and cultural differences among the three economies explain the discrepancies.",0
"Money, Time, and the Stability of Consumer Preferences",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Consumers often make product choices that involve the consideration of money and time. Building on dual-process models, the authors propose that these two basic resources activate qualitatively different modes of processing: while money is processed analytically, time is processed more affectively. Importantly, this distinction then influences the stability of consumer preferences. An initial set of three experiments demonstrates that, compared with a control condition free of the consideration of either resource, money consideration generates significantly more violations of transitivity in product choice, while time consideration has no such impact. The next three experiments use multiple approaches to demonstrate the role of different processing modes associated with money versus time consideration in this result. Finally, two additional experiments test ways in which the cognitive noise associated with the analytical processing that money consideration triggers could be reduced, resulting in more consistent preferences.",1
A Memory-Theory Perspective of Country-Image Formation,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Traditional country-of-origin strategy in international marketing uses a country-image halo to cue beliefs about the country's products. With expansive trade globalization, domestic consumers are likely to have experience with foreign products but know little of the products? origin country. Thus, equally important as traditional theory is the question of whether product beliefs can imbue country image, but little is known of this reverse influence. If product beliefs can generalize into a favorable country image, a chain effect will then enable traditional country-of-origin effects to benefit the country's other products. In this study, the results of three surveys across two countries show that product beliefs can indeed influence country image. However, the influence weakens with increasing country familiarity and exists only when the product and country are congruent. Furthermore, the influence can operate outside of conscious awareness. The authors draw on the associative network theory of memory to explain their findings. This research improves the theoretical understanding of country- and product-image halo and provides the grounds for product and brand managers to work with government and tourist organizations for increasing mutual effectiveness.",0
"Extending the Environment?Strategy?Performance Framework: The Roles of Multinational Corporation Network Strength, Market Responsiveness, and Product Innovation",Journal of International Marketing,2010,"The purpose of this study is to extend the traditional environment?strategy?performance framework by including network theory to examine when a foreign firm can use its multinational corporation (MNC) network strength to buffer market turbulence and technological turbulence and when the foreign firm can deploy it to support the influences of marketing strategic postures (i.e., market responsiveness and product innovation) on firm performance. The author tests the hypotheses on data collected from 140 foreign firms in China. Although prior research has demonstrated that firms often use multiple strategies and resources to cope with environmental forces, the findings illustrate that different environmental segments have unequal bearings on market responsiveness, product innovation, and MNC network strength. In addition, despite the direct positive influences of individual marketing strategic postures and MNC network strength on firm performance, their combined effects are mixed. The author concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for research and practice.",0
Knowledge Transfer between Multinational Corporations? Headquarters and Their Subsidiaries: Influences on and Implications for New Product Outcomes,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"A multinational corporation's (MNC's) competitive advantage depends increasingly on control over intangible resources, such as knowledge and relational capital. Although prior research has suggested that cross-border knowledge transfer in MNCs is critical to their new product outcomes, the conditions under which such knowledge transfer can serve to induce positive outcomes remain unclear. This study builds on resource-based theory to suggest that knowledge and MNC network strength are the two critical firm resources individually and collectively influencing new product outcomes. Because MNCs are subject to the pressures on various environmental changes, the authors rely on the contingency theory to examine when knowledge transfer works in differential global market and technological turbulence. The results of a survey of MNC headquarters show that the impacts of cross-border knowledge transfer on new product outcomes are not always positive, depending on the levels of network strength and environmental turbulence.",0
In Search of Platforms to Increase Market Responsiveness: Evidence from Foreign Subsidiaries,Journal of International Marketing,2009,Market responsiveness is one of several important outcome consequences that denote a foreign subsidiary's success. The authors examine how foreign subsidiaries can improve their market responsiveness through understanding the different roles of information system integration and knowledge codification in connection with related market knowledge that resides in their headquarters. The authors test hypotheses on data collected from 140 foreign subsidiaries in China. The results indicate that knowledge codification plays a key role in influencing market responsiveness directly and further acts as a critical mechanism that mediates the impacts of knowledge relatedness and information system integration on market responsiveness. The authors discuss the implications of these results for research and practice.,0
Strategic Responses to New Technologies and Their Impact on Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Modern corporations must adopt and assimilate new technologies to build and sustain competitive advantage. The authors develop a theoretical framework to understand the relationships among (1) strategic responses to new technologies, (2) organizational resources, and (3) firm performance. Specifically, they theorize that a strategic response can be categorized according to the dimensions of magnitude, domain, and speed, and they conceptualize organizational resources as tangible and intangible. The authors operationalize this framework for the adoption of the Internet by traditional store-based retailers, for which they posit strategic responses as the speed of (1) adopting the Internet as a communications channel, (2) adopting the Internet as a sales channel, and (3) forming e-alliances. In addition, they use resource slack to represent organizational resources. Results from nine years (1992?2000) of data on 106 firms establish the influence of strategic responses on firm performance (i.e., market valuation of the firm, operationalized as Tobin's q). Specifically, the results show that both the adoption of the Internet as a communications channel and e-alliance formation positively influence firm performance. The positive effect of communications channel adoption on firm performance is enhanced further by the use of slack resources. Post hoc analysis reveals that the adoption of the Internet as a sales channel seems to matter only to firms that have preexisting catalog operations.",0
Is Product Imitation Good for Firm Performance? An Examination of Product Imitation Types and Contingency Factors,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Despite the prevailing phenomenon of product imitation in transition economies, theoretical development of product imitation strategies still lags behind anecdotal evidence. The authors distinguish between pure imitation and creative imitation and examine their contingent effects on firm performance. They test hypotheses on data collected from multiple sources, including top and middle managers and archival financial data from 192 firms in China. The findings indicate that creative imitation has a stronger positive effect on financial performance (i.e., lagged return on assets) than pure imitation. Furthermore, pure imitation and creative imitation, when coupled with strong marketing capability, positively affect market performance (i.e., market share). Finally, compared with their local counterparts, foreign firms operating in China benefit less from pure and creative imitations in terms of financial performance.",0
Automated Marketing Research Using Online Customer Reviews,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Market structure analysis is a basic pillar of marketing research. Classic challenges in marketing such as pricing, campaign management, brand positioning, and new product development are rooted in an analysis of product substitutes and complements inferred from market structure. In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews. First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the ?voice of the consumer,? as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product attributes. The authors evaluate managerial insights drawn from the analysis with respect to proprietary market research reports from the same period analyzing digital imaging products.",1
When Good Cheer Goes Unrequited: How Emotional Receptivity Affects Evaluation of Expressed Emotion,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"In three studies, the authors introduce and probe the role of emotional receptivity in consumer?marketer interactions. Emotional receptivity refers to a person's disposition toward experiencing a preferred level of emotional intensity. The results from the first two studies conducted in the laboratory and the field collectively demonstrate that consumers feel greater enjoyment and enhanced liking for the marketer when there is a close match between their emotional receptivity and the level of emotional intensity displayed by the marketer. In the third study, the authors show that consumers? emotional receptivity can be temporarily increased or decreased using advertisements that depict more or less expressive social interactions, respectively. The findings are similar to those observed in the first two studies. In addition, a preliminary study establishes the discriminant validity of the proposed battery of emotional receptivity items from existing related constructs. The authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications and offer suggestions for further research.",1
The Structure of Survey-Based Brand Metrics,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"To better understand how a brand is performing in the marketplace, firms employ a wide variety of measures, with consumer-based surveys often playing a central role. The authors identify some core dimensions of survey-based measures of brand performance, explore how they link to one another, and examine how they vary across both countries and categories. Studies in the United States and China of soft drinks, toothpaste, and fast food suggest that survey-based brand metrics can be categorized into six main dimensions that reflect a four-stage, hierarchy-of-effects awareness?interest?desire?action?type ordering: (1) comprehension; (2) comparative advantage, interpersonal relations, and history; (3) preference; and (4) attachment. Despite differences in culture and their history, these dimensions usefully portray different brands and products across the different countries.",0
Sophistication in Research in Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Over the years, the level of analytical rigor has risen in articles published in marketing academic journals. While, ceteris paribus, rigor is desirable, there is a growing sense that rigor has become a, if not the, goal for research in marketing. Consequently, other desirable characteristics, such as relevance, communicability, and simplicity, have been downplayed, to the detriment of the field of marketing. The authors explore this imbalance, setting forth the consequences of overemphasis on rigor for (1) the manuscript review process, (2) PhD programs, (3) hiring, and (4) the tenure and promotion review process. Two surveys of ?successful? authors provide empirical support for the conjectures put forth. The authors then identify the causes for this trend and propose some directions to reestablish a better balance between rigor and relevance.",0
Sales through Sequential Distribution Channels: An Application to Movies and Videos,Journal of Marketing,2000,"This article focuses on the sale of a product across channels that are entered sequentially. Using a two-channel model, the authors derive the optimal time to enter the second channel and then obtain a specific parametric solution for movie distributors regarding theater attendance and subsequent sales to video stores. Using data from 35 movies, the authors estimate exponential sales curves for both theater attendance and video rentals and demonstrate how knowledge of the sales parameters in the first channel (theaters) helps predict sales in the second channel (video rentals). Finally, from the movie distributor's perspective, the authors calculate optimal release times based on the model and its estimated parameters. The results suggest that profits would increase if movies were released to video sooner than is the current practice.",0
Base-Rate Information in Consumer Attributions of Product-Harm Crises,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Consumers spontaneously construct attributions for negative events such as product-harm crises. Base-rate information influences these attributions. The research findings suggest that for brands with positive prior beliefs, a high (vs. low) base rate of product-harm crises leads to less blame if the crisis is said to be similar to others in the industry (referred to as the ?discounting effect?). However, in the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the ?subtyping effect?). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who discount a first crisis also tend to discount a second crisis for the same brand, whereas consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again.",1
Negative Spillover in Brand Portfolios: Exploring the Antecedents of Asymmetric Effects,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Marketers cultivate brand relatedness in their brand portfolios to increase marketing efficiency through positive spillover of brand equity. However, creating linkages between brands may also make them vulnerable to negative spillover. This research investigates the structure of relatedness in a brand portfolio to understand the nature of spillover effects. The results of two experiments show that the magnitude of spillover between brands is a function of not only the strength of brand associations but also their directionality. The results also show that the directional strength of association is influenced by the number and salience of associations linked to each brand. The authors draw implications for a theoretical understanding of spillover effects in marketing, as well as for the management of brand portfolios.",0
Falling Back on Numbers: When Preference for Numerical Product Information Increases after a Personal Control Threat,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Despite the ubiquity of numerical information in consumers? lives, prior research has provided limited insights to marketers about when numerical information exerts greater impact on decisions. This study offers evidence that judgments involving numerical information can be affected by consumers? sense of personal control over the environment. A numerical attribute?s format communicates the extent to which the magnitude of a benefit is predictable (Study 1a), such that people who experience a control threat and want to see their external environment as predictable (Study 1b) rely on point value (vs. range) information as a general signal that the environment is predictable (Study 2). A personal control threat changes consumers? preferences as a function of whether the numerical information appears as a point value or a range (Studies 3?4). This heightened focus on format may lessen the impact of a product benefit?s predicted magnitude, if a lower magnitude is specified in a more precise format (Study 5). Study 6 provides first evidence that the interactive effect of personal control levels and numerical formats can affect consequential choices.",1
Bagging and Boosting Classification Trees to Predict Churn,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this article, the authors explore the bagging and boosting classification techniques. They apply the two techniques to a customer database of an anonymous U.S. wireless telecommunications company, and both significantly improve accuracy in predicting churn. This higher predictive performance could ultimately lead to incremental profits for companies that use these methods. Furthermore, the results recommend the use of a balanced sampling scheme when predicting a rare event from large data sets, but this requires an appropriate bias correction.",1
Developing Synergies between Promotions and Brands in Different Price-Quality Tiers,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Brands are promoted in many different ways. In this research, the authors examine synergies between different types of promotions and characteristics of the brands that offer the promotions. Specifically, the authors examine interactions among feature advertising, display, price promotions, and the price-quality tier of the brand offering them. Using both scanner data and experiments, the authors find that high-tier brands benefit more than low-tier brands from price promotions, displays, or feature advertising when these promotional tools are used by themselves. This advantage disappears, however, when certain promotional tools are used in combination with one another. In particular, the authors find that price promotions have a more equal effect on low-tier and high-tier brands when these promotions are offered in settings where comparisons are difficult (end-of-aisle displays or feature advertising). Furthermore, the combined effects of displays and price promotions, or feature advertising and price promotions, are greater on the low-tier brands than on the high-tier brands. The results provide insights into the conditions under which specific marketing tools are most effective for which brands. The authors discuss theoretical implications of the results as they relate to promotions and consumer decision making and outline strategic implications for retailers and manufacturers.",1
Understanding Customer Experience Throughout the Customer Journey,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Understanding customer experience and the customer journey over time is critical for firms. Customers now interact with firms through myriad touch points in multiple channels and media, and customer experiences are more social in nature. These changes require firms to integrate multiple business functions, and even external partners, in creating and delivering positive customer experiences. In this article, the authors aim to develop a stronger understanding of customer experience and the customer journey in this era of increasingly complex customer behavior. To achieve this goal, they examine existing definitions and conceptualizations of customer experience as a construct and provide a historical perspective of the roots of customer experience within marketing. Next, they attempt to bring together what is currently known about customer experience, customer journeys, and customer experience management. Finally, they identify critical areas for future research on this important topic.",0
Dynamic Customer Relationship Management: Incorporating Future Considerations into the Service Retention Decision,Journal of Marketing,2002,"The authors examine the influence of customer future-focused considerations, over and above the effects of satisfaction, on the customer's decision to discontinue a service relationship. The authors find that expected future use and anticipated regret influence this decision. Understanding and managing these future-focused considerations is critical to successful dynamic customer relationship management.",0
Practices and Performance of Small Retail Stores in Developing Economies,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"As multinational corporations have expanded beyond the borders of developed economies and into fast-growing developing regions of the world, they have struggled to understand and manage a retail format that is dominant in many of those economies?the small retailer. The authors first synthesize existing literature on the phenomenon of small retailing to deliver a macro perspective of this retail format and its evolution. Then, they delve deeper into an urban market in a developing economy and provide an empirical illustration that sheds light on the decision-making processes of the small retailers and their operational performance. This yields a complementary micro perspective of the phenomenon that has been absent in the literature. The analysis provides insights into how firms that enter markets in developing economies can manage and profit from this important but frequently overlooked distribution format.",0
The Value of Informative Priors in Bayesian Inference with Sparse Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Informative priors that reflect the structure of the model can improve estimation when data are sparse, while ?standard,? noninformative priors can have unintended consequences. First, the authors discuss selecting informative priors for variances and introduce a conjugate prior for covariance matrices. The proposed prior is more flexible than the inverse Wishart without increasing computations. Second, the authors investigate the impact of priors for the covariance of parameter heterogeneity when the predictor variables are qualitative. Estimates of the omitted effects are spurious with the standard prior. The authors propose an effects prior that treats all effects symmetrically. Third, the authors consider willingness to pay. These ratio estimators magnify uncertainty in the price coefficients and can give unreasonable values for price-insensitive consumers. The authors show that estimation of willingness to pay can be greatly improved by restricting the parameters without distorting them. In all three cases, the standard, noninformative priors perform well for nonsparse data. However, for sparse data, the proposed prior distributions better match the structures of the marketing research problems and improve inferences.",1

"Empirical Research on Export Barriers: Review, Assessment, and Synthesis",Journal of International Marketing,1995,"The article attempts to review, assess, and synthesize existing empirical research on factors impeding the initiation, development, or sustainment of export activities. The investigation covered 35 studies and revealed that from the conceptual aspect, research on the subject is still at the identification and conceptualization stage. It was also demonstrated that the methodologies adopted were unsophisticated and flawed in some respects. On the empirical side, no uniform pattern was observed in the findings of the studies investigated. An aggregation of the empirical data, however, revealed that the existence of limited information to locate and analyze foreign markets had the greatest inhibiting effect on export behavior. The influence of some export barriers was also found to vary according to certain methodological parameters. Finally, an attempted classification of export barriers revealed no significant differences among the resulting categories as to their inhibiting impact on exporting.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of Infidelity in Cross-Border Business Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"The volatile, complex, and distant nature of the international business environment inevitably gives rise to incidences of infidelity among interacting exporters and importers. The authors propose and test a theoretically anchored model of the antecedents and consequences of infidelity in exporter?importer working relationships. The findings confirm that importers? infidelity incidences occur more often in cases in which trust, satisfaction, commitment, and cooperation are low in the relationship. Indeed, the association between poor relationship quality and infidelity becomes stronger when the relationship is at a declining stage and is relatively young. The existence of infidelity in the relationship will lead to either punitive actions or reassessment measures on the part of the exporter, which are moderated by the degree of long-term orientation and social bonding that exists between the interacting parties.",0
The Role of Exporters? Emotional Intelligence in Building Foreign Customer Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Despite the critical importance of emotional intelligence in effectively interacting with other people, its role has been overlooked in scholarly research on cross-border interorganizational relationships. Drawing on emotion regulation theory, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes links among exporters? emotional intelligence, key behavioral dimensions characterizing the atmosphere of the relationship with import buyers, and the resulting relational performance. They test the model with data collected from 262 Greek exporters using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that higher levels of exporter emotional intelligence enhance communication and social bonding with the importer while diminishing distance and conflict in their working relationship. Relational performance is positively influenced by communication and social bonding but negatively affected by distance and conflict. The results also reveal the moderating effect of both opportunism and interpartner incompatibility on the association between the exporter?s emotional intelligence and the behavioral atmosphere of the relationship with import buyers.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of an Eco-Friendly Export Marketing Strategy: The Moderating Role of Foreign Public Concern and Competitive Intensity,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Despite growing concerns about environmental issues worldwide, research on the subject in the context of international marketing is virtually absent. The current study sheds light on the green aspects of exporting, using data collected from 216 exporting manufacturers. Drawing on the resource-based view and industrial organization theories, the authors show that certain organizational resources (i.e., financial, physical, and experiential) and capabilities (i.e., shared vision, cross-functional coordination, and technology sensing/response) are conducive to the deployment of an eco-friendly export marketing strategy (comprising product, price, distribution, and promotional elements). Such a strategy is more evident for exporters of industrial (vs. consumer) goods as well as for firms that sell to developed (vs. developing) countries. The results also suggest that the adoption of a green export marketing strategy has a positive effect on the firm's export performance. In addition, the authors find that the strength of the link between eco-friendly export marketing strategy and export performance is positively moderated by foreign market environmental public concern and competitive intensity.",0
Executive Insights: Building Successful Export Business Relationships: A Behavioral Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Although the United States has been one of the leading actors in international trade, limited evidence exists as to individual U.S. company relationships with overseas customers. On the basis of a sample of 201 U.S. exporting manufacturers, the authors draw a comparison between harmonious and problematic foreign business relationships. The findings reveal that, as opposed to problematic cases, firms with harmonious relationships are more experienced, employ more people, and exhibit more active behavior toward conducting their foreign business. Such firms sell to a greater number of export markets, deal with more foreign customers, and obtain more orders. The study also shows that harmonious relationships with overseas customers are distinguished by greater dependence, trust, understanding, commitment, communication, and cooperation but less distance, uncertainty, and conflict between the parties. The article provides export management with a set of guidelines for establishing, developing, and sustaining successful export business relationships.",0
Identifying Managerial Influences on Exporting: Past Research and Future Directions,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Research on exporting frequently stresses the role of managerial characteristics as influences on the export behavior of the firm. This article reviews the conceptual, methodological, and empirical insights gained from a systematic analysis of 46 studies conducted on this subject. Undoubtedly, this stream of research has enhanced understanding of the importance of managerial elements in affecting exporting activities. However, conceptually this research is still in its exploratory phase of development, lacking an integral theoretical framework. Certain methodological limitations are also identified, especially with respect to sampling designs, fieldwork procedures, and analytical methods. Empirically, hypothesized associations between managerial factors and export dimensions lead to diverse and sometimes conflicting findings, except for attributes of a general-subjective nature that demonstrate a consistently strong relationship with exporting?particularly in relation to the firm's propensity to export. The review reaches certain significant conclusions and suggests directions for future research in the field.",0
"Personality Traits, Consumer Animosity, and Foreign Product Avoidance: The Moderating Role of Individual Cultural Characteristics",Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Although personality and cultural traits were found to be important predictors or moderators of consumer attitudes and behavior, their relationship to consumer animosity has not yet been studied. This article reports the findings of a study conducted with 606 Ukrainian consumers, which aims to identify personality drivers and behavioral outcomes of consumer animosity as well as the moderating role of cultural characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals that extraversion and conscientiousness have a negative effect on consumer animosity, whereas neuroticism and openness are positively associated with this feeling. However, no significant relationship was observed between animosity and agreeableness. In turn, consumer animosity was found to influence product avoidance, and this association became stronger in the case of consumers that have higher levels of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and masculinity. The study also showed that male and educated consumers are more likely to harbor animosity toward a hostility-evoking country, while age and income had no control effect on animosity. Several implications for theory and practice are derived from the study findings, and directions for future research are provided.",0
"National Export-Promotion Programs as Drivers of Organizational Resources and Capabilities: Effects on Strategy, Competitive Advantage, and Performance",Journal of International Marketing,2011,"The authors present the results of a study that empirically tests a model connecting national export-promotion programs with export performance through the intervening role of export-related organizational resources and capabilities, export marketing strategy, and export competitive advantage. The study reveals that the adoption of specific national export-promotion programs positively strengthens the firm's export-related resources and capabilities, which in turn are instrumental in developing a sound export marketing strategy. By realizing this strategy, the firm enjoys competitive advantages related to costs, products, or services, which in turn help it achieve superior export performance in both market and financial dimensions. In addition, the firm's export market performance has a positive impact on export financial performance. This study also shows that the effect of national export-promotion programs on export-related resources and capabilities is stronger among smaller firms and, for some programs, among firms with less export experience.",0
"Antecedents and Outcomes of Exporter?Importer Relationship Quality: Synthesis, Meta-Analysis, and Directions for Further Research",Journal of International Marketing,2014,"The authors identify, synthesize, and evaluate antecedents, components, and outcome factors of exporter?importer relationship quality following a meta-analysis of the extant empirical studies on the subject. Using information extracted from a content analysis of 76 empirical studies, they propose and test an integrative conceptual model comprising five antecedents (i.e., opportunism, conflict, communication, distance, and adaptation) and two outcomes (i.e., relational performance and financial performance) of relationship quality (which consists of cooperation, trust, and commitment). Using structural equation modeling, the authors confirm the vast majority of the hypothesized associations between antecedent factors and relationship quality dimensions and between relationship quality dimensions and performance outcomes and verify a positive link between relational performance and financial performance. The authors conclude by offering both theoretical and managerial implications as well as directions for further research.",0
To Bundle or Not to Bundle: Determinants of the Profitability of Multi-Item Auctions,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This article introduces and empirically tests a conceptual model of the key determinants of the profitability of bundling in auction markets. The model encapsulates hypotheses about how seller revenue from the combined (i.e., bundle) auction of component products relative to that from separate auctions of the components is influenced by the heterogeneity in bidders? product valuations, the degree of complementarity between component products, the particular multi-item selling strategy, and the outside availability of the products. The results of three field experiments show that though bundle auctions tend to be less profitable for noncomplementary and substitute products, they are on average 50% more profitable than separate auctions when there is (even only moderate) complementarity between the component products. The latter effect is greater when the bundle and the separate components are offered at different times, and it is more pronounced for services than for tangible goods. The findings also identify conditions under which each of the essential multi-item selling strategies for fixed-price settings (pure components, pure bundling, and mixed bundling) tends to maximize seller revenue in auctions.",0
Man Versus Machine: Resisting Automation in Identity-Based Consumer Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Automation is transforming many consumption domains, including everyday activities such as cooking or driving, as well as recreational activities like fishing or cycling. Yet little research in marketing examines consumer preferences for automated products. Automation often provides obvious consumption benefits, but six studies spanning a variety of product categories show that automation may not be desirable when identity motives are important drivers of consumption. Using both correlational and experimental designs, these studies demonstrate that people who strongly identify with a particular social category resist automated features that hinder the attribution of identity-relevant consumption outcomes to themselves. The findings have substantial theoretical implications for research on identity and technology, as well as managerial implications for targeting, product innovation, and communication.",1
Highlighting Effort Versus Talent in Service Employee Performance: Customer Attributions and Responses,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Firms often attribute their service employees? competent performance to either dedicated effort or natural talent. However, it is unclear how such practices affect customer evaluations of service employees and customer outcomes. Moreover, prior work has primarily examined attributions of one?s own performance, providing little insight on the impact of attributions of others? performance. Drawing on research regarding the warmth?competence framework and performance attributions, the current research proposes and finds that consumers expect a more communal-oriented and less exchange-oriented relationship when a service employee?s competent performance is attributed to dedicated effort rather than natural talent, as effort (vs. talent) attribution leads consumers to perceive the employee as warmer. The authors further propose customer helping behaviors as downstream consequences of relationship expectations, finding that effort (vs. talent) attribution is more likely to induce customers? word-of-mouth and idea provision behaviors. The findings enrich existing literature by identifying performance attributions as a managerially meaningful antecedent of relationship expectations and offer practical guidance on how marketers can influence consumers? relationship expectations and helping behaviors.",0
Engaging Customer Cocreation in New Product Development Through Foreign Subsidiaries: Influences of Multinational Corporations? Global Integration and Local Adaptation Mechanisms,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Efforts to engage customers in cocreating new products have garnered much research attention from studies documenting customer cocreation?s (CC?s) positive impact on firm innovation and performance. Less research, however, has counterbalanced the bright side with the potential dark side of CC, especially as a strategy for multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in foreign markets. This study examines how MNC subsidiaries? CC affects new product innovativeness and knowledge leakage to competitors. Adopting a broader agency perspective to recognize that subsidiaries often do not perform up to headquarters? expectations due to both self-serving opportunism and honest incompetence, this study explores how CC effects are contingent on MNCs? global management mechanisms. Using a dyadic managerial survey of 238 MNC subsidiaries, the authors find that MNCs can control knowledge leakage by implementing proper global integration and local adaptation mechanisms. However, CC may not improve new product innovativeness, except when the subsidiary has low local research-and-development staff influence. This study contributes to the CC literature by showing its benefits, challenges, and boundary conditions as a growing MNC innovation strategy.",0
Emotional Accounting: How Feelings about Money Influence Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Mental accounting posits that people track their expenditures using cognitive categories or ?mental accounts.? The authors propose that this cognitive process can be complemented by an approach that examines how feelings about a sum of money, or the money's ?affective tag,? influence its consumption. When people receive money under negative circumstances, this tag can include a negative affect component, which people aim to reduce by engaging in strategic consumption. The authors investigate two such strategies, laundering and hedonic avoidance, and demonstrate their effect on consumption of windfalls. The authors find that people avoid spending their negatively tagged money on hedonic expenditures and prefer to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures to reduce, or ?launder,? their negative feelings about the windfall. The authors call this tagging process and strategic consumption ?emotional accounting.?",1
The Influence of Loyalty Programs and Short-Term Promotions on Customer Retention,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Despite the proliferation of loyalty programs in a wide range of categories, there is little empirical research that focuses on the measurement of such programs. The key to measuring the influence of loyalty programs is that they operate as dynamic incentive schemes by providing benefits based on cumulative purchasing over time. As such, loyalty programs encourage consumers to shift from myopic or single-period decision making to dynamic or multiple-period decision making. In this study the author models customers' response to a loyalty program under the assumption that purchases represent the sequential choices of customers who are solving a dynamic optimization problem. The author estimates the theoretical model using a discrete-choice dynamic programming formulation. The author evaluates a specific loyalty program with data from an online merchant that specializes in grocery and drugstore items. Through simulation and policy experiments, it is possible to evaluate and compare the long-term effects of the loyalty program and other marketing instruments (e.g., e-mail coupons, fulfillment rates, shipping fees) on customer retention. Empirical results and policy experiments suggest that the loyalty program under study is successful in increasing annual purchasing for a substantial proportion of customers.",1
Incorporating Strategic Consumer Behavior into Customer Valuation,Journal of Marketing,2005,The calculation of customer value without regard to marketing policy is problematic because the value of managerial flexibility and the impact of consumer learning are neglected. This article develops a structural dynamic programming model of consumer demand that includes marketing variables and consumer expectations of promotions. The author uses the estimated parameters to conduct policy experiments that yield more accurate forecasts of customer value and to study the impact of alternative marketing policies.,0
Customer Acquisition Promotions and Customer Asset Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this article, the author addresses the question of how a firm's acquisition efforts influence the composition of the customer portfolio. The first part of the research is a conceptual model that illustrates how customer uncertainty provides an explanation for why promotionally acquired customers have lower repurchase rates and smaller lifetime values. The second part of the research involves empirical analyses of customer-level data from a newspaper and an online grocer. In both data sets, acquisition discount depth is negatively related to repeat-buying rates and customer asset value. For example, a 35% acquisition discount results in customers with about one-half the long-term value of non-promotionally acquired customers.",1
Individual Team Incentives and Managing Competitive Balance in Sports Leagues: An Empirical Analysis of Major League Baseball,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have long been concerned with competitive imbalances caused by differences in local revenues. The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from high-local-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million. Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically, the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion.",1
"Achieving Superior Financial Performance in China: Differentiation, Cost Leadership, or Both?",Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Firms operating in emerging economies must make appropriate marketing strategy choices to address the idiosyncratic challenges of rapid changes and institutional voids. The authors investigate when various types of marketing strategies work by examining the effects of both pure and dual strategies on financial performance for domestic versus foreign firms and across different market concentration levels in China's emerging economy. According to a survey of 249 firms, the effectiveness of specific strategy choices varies depending on domesticity and the level of market concentration. In particular, the impacts of both cost and dual strategies on financial performance are stronger for foreign firms than for domestic firms. Although cost-leadership and dual strategies are less effective in less concentrated markets than in more concentrated ones, the effect of a differentiation strategy is stronger when the level of market concentration is low rather than high.",0
Marketing's Influence and New Product Performance in Chinese Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This article explores the role of marketing in the new product development process from a sociopolitical influence perspective. It makes an explicit distinction between the participation and influence of marketing and empirically investigates their differential effects on new product performance. The results, based on data collected from 114 high-technology firms in China, suggest that marketing's influence is related positively to new product market performance and timeliness of development. They also support the argument that the positive effect of marketing's participation on new product performance is mediated completely by its influence. Furthermore, the study reveals that the effectiveness of marketing's influence on new product performance depends on product newness to the firm, project formalization, perceived power of marketing, and the strength of the influence attempt. Managerial and research implications of the findings are explored.",0
Optimal Design of Free Samples for Digital Products and Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Marketers of digital content such as books, news, video, music, and mobile games often provide free samples of the content for consumers to try out before buying the product or signing up for subscription. Similarly, firms selling software (such as software as a service), and cloud-based services may provide free limited-version products or a free-trial period for the service. In this article, the authors focus on how firms should design such free samples to maximize their revenue. They examine in an analytical setting how quality and other design parameters of the sample affect profit generated by the product or service. They then test the normative implications in the application context of a book publisher that provides free samples for the books it sells online. Using a field experiment, the authors vary the design parameters of the sample and, based on the demand estimates, provide recommendations for the firm on the optimal design of the sample. They find that, rather than being substitutes, free samples of the entire content can be very effective in increasing revenues. Furthermore, they find that higher-quality samples have a greater impact on the sales of popular content. This has important implications for freemium and free-trial business models.",1
Attributing Conversions in a Multichannel Online Marketing Environment: An Empirical Model and a Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Technology enables a firm to produce a granular record of every touchpoint consumers make in their online purchase journey before they convert at the firm's website. However, firms still depend on aggregate measures to guide their marketing investments in multiple online channels (e.g., display, paid search, referral, e-mail). This article introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data of customers? touches. The authors propose a measurement model to analyze customers? (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to different channels and find that these channels? relative contributions are significantly different from those found by other currently used metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions. In targeting customers with different patterns of touches in their purchase funnel, these estimates help identify cases in which retargeting strategies may actually decrease conversion probabilities.",1
Charting the Path to Purchase Using Topic Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"In gathering information for an intended purchase decision, consumers submit search phrases to online search engines. These search phrases directly express the consumers? needs in their own words and thus provide valuable information to marketing managers. Interpreting consumers? search phrases renders a better understanding of their purchase intentions, which is critical for marketing success. In this article, the authors develop an integrated model to connect the latent topics embedded in consumers? search phrases to their website visits and purchase decisions. Using a unique data set containing more than 8,000 search phrases submitted by consumers, the model identifies latent topics underlying the searches that led consumers to the firm?s website. Compared with a model lacking any textual information from consumers? search phrases, a model using textual data in a heuristic approach, and a model based on the latent Dirichlet allocation, the proposed model provides a better evaluation of a consumer?s position on the path to purchase and achieves much better predictive accuracy, which could in turn substantially increase the firm?s revenue. The authors also extend the discussion to aggregators, affiliated websites, and segments of consumers who are exposed to the firm?s outbound ads. Marketing managers can use this method to extract structured information from consumers? search phrases to facilitate their inference of consumers? latent purchase states and thereby improve marketing efficiency.",1
Path to Purpose? How Online Customer Journeys Differ for Hedonic Versus Utilitarian Purchases,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The authors examine consumers? information channel usage during the customer journey by employing a hedonic and utilitarian (H/U) perspective, an important categorization of consumption purpose. Taking a retailer-category viewpoint to measure the H/U characteristics of 20 product categories at 40 different retailers, this study combines large-scale secondary clickstream and primary survey data to offer actionable insights for retailers in a competitive landscape. The data reveal that, when making hedonic purchases (e.g., toys), consumers employ social media and on-site product pages as early as two weeks before the final purchase. By contrast, for utilitarian purchases (e.g., office supplies), consumers utilize third-party reviews up to two weeks before the final purchase and make relatively greater usage of search engines, deals, and competitors? product pages closer to the time of purchase. Importantly, channel usage is different for sessions in which no purchase is made, indicating that consumers? information channel choices vary significantly with the H/U characteristics of purchases. The article closes with an extensive discussion of the significant implications for managing customer touchpoints.",0
The Double-Edged Effects of E-Commerce Cart Retargeting: Does Retargeting Too Early Backfire?,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Consumers often abandon e-commerce carts, so companies are shifting their online advertising budgets to immediate e-commerce cart retargeting (ECR). They presume that early reminder ads, relative to late ones, generate more click-throughs and web revisits. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the double-edged effects of ECR ads and empirically support it with a multistudy, multisetting design. Study 1 involves two field experiments on over 40,500 customers who are randomized to either receive an ECR ad via email and app channels (treatment) or not receive it (control) across different hourly blocks after cart abandonment. The authors find that customers who received an early ECR ad within 30 minutes to one hour after cart abandonment are less likely to make a purchase compared with the control. These findings reveal a causal negative incremental impact of immediate retargeting. In other words, delivering ECR ads too early can engender worse purchase rates than without delivering them, thus wasting online advertising budgets. By contrast, a late ECR ad received one to three days after cart abandonment has a positive incremental impact on customer purchases. In Study 2, another field experiment on 23,900 customers not only replicates the double-edged impact of ECR ads delivered by mobile short message service but also explores cart characteristics that amplify both the negative impact of early ECR ads and positive impact of late ECR ads. These findings offer novel insights into customer responses to online retargeted ads for researchers and managers alike.",0
Inconsistencies in International Product Strategies and Performance of High-Tech Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"This article explores two unresolved issues in the international business literature. First, it is not clear why high-tech firms should standardize their product strategies across countries. Second, the rationale for high-tech firms to forge international strategic alliances (ISAs) is unknown. Drawing on organizational ecology and structural inertia theories, this study proposes that the interactions between a firm's structural inertia and environmental hostility are hazardous to firm performance and that ISAs weaken their impacts. Using data from 167 Canadian high-tech firms, this study supports that hypothesis and uncovers important implications for research and practice. Firms? structural inertia makes inconsistency in international product strategies destructive. When structural inertia interacts with the environmental hostility associated with high-tech industries, the impacts can be stronger. High-tech firms resort to ISAs, using their partners to implement different product strategies to avoid adverse outcomes. Thus, ISAs are mechanisms that high-tech firms use to reduce the strategy inconsistencies across countries.",0
Success in China's Industrial Market: An Institutional and Environmental Approach,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"During China's rapid transition from a planned to a market economy, a major issue that has not been adequately addressed is ?What determines a firm's performance?? This study proposes an institutional and environmental approach to evaluate how a firm performs in this dynamic transitional economy. Using a data set containing China's entire industrial market, this study finds that a firm's performance is shaped by its institutional characteristics and its environment, along with other strategic factors such as its market share. A surprising and yet important finding is the superior performance of the so-called ?collectively owned? enterprises. The article not only explores the theoretical relationship between firm performance and institutional and environmental factors in transitional economies, but also is helpful for managers in developing such marketing strategies as market assessment, entry strategy, or partner selection.",0
Internet Auction Features as Quality Signals,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Internet auction companies have developed innovative tools that enable sellers to reveal more information about their credibility and product quality to avoid the ?lemons? problem. On the basis of signaling and auction theories, the authors propose a typology of Internet auction quality and credibility indicators, adopt and modify Park and Bradlow's (2005) model, and use eBay as an example to examine empirically how different types of indicators help alleviate uncertainty. This empirical evidence demonstrates how Internet auction features affect consumer participation and bidding decisions, what modifies the credibility of quality indicators, and how different buyers react to indicators. The signaling-based hypotheses provide coherent explanations of consumers? bidding behavior. As the first empirical study to evaluate the signaling role of comprehensive Internet auction institutional features in mitigating the adverse selection problem, this research provides evidence to clarify the economic foundation behind innovative Internet auction designs.",0
Cross-Selling the Right Product to the Right Customer at the Right Time,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Firms are challenged to improve the effectiveness of cross-selling campaigns. The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion, advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing customers while taking into account the development of customer demand over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right product to the right customer at the right time using the right communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors demonstrate that households have different preferences and responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%) and instantaneous promotional effect (2%). The cross-selling solicitations resulting from the proposed framework are more customized and dynamic and improve immediate response rate by 56%, long-term response rate by 149%, and long-term profit by 177%.",1
Cross-Selling Sequentially Ordered Products: An Application to Consumer Banking Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Customers have predictable life cycles. As a result of these life cycles, firms that sell multiple products or services frequently observe that, in general, certain items are purchased before others. This predictable phenomenon provides opportunities for firms to cross-sell additional products and services to existing customers. This article presents a structural multivariate probit model to investigate how customer demand for multiple products evolves over time and its implications for the sequential acquisition patterns of naturally ordered products. The authors investigate customer purchase patterns for products that are marketed by a large midwestern bank. Among the substantive findings are that women and older customers are more sensitive to their overall satisfaction with the bank than are men and younger customers when determining whether to purchase additional financial services, and households whose head has a greater level of education or is male move more quickly along the financial maturity continuum than do households whose head has less education or is female.",1
The Impact of the Marketing?R&D Interface on New Product Export Performance: A Contingency Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"On the basis of the literature, a conceptual framework of the relationship between the marketing-research and development (R&D) interface and new product performance in export markets is developed. The product category chosen to test the model is software from the U.S. computer industry. The findings indicate that the marketing?R&D interface exerts a positive impact on new product performance in foreign markets. The results regarding internal and external environmental antecedents, including centralization and customer sophistication, offer some evidence that suggests correlations between these factors and activities of the marketing?R&D interface. This study contributes to marketing research by testing the effect of the marketing?R&D interface in export markets. Managerially, it recommends ways for U.S. companies to enhance new product performance abroad.",0
Transparency of Behavior-Based Pricing,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Behavior-based pricing (BBP) refers to the practice in which firms collect consumers? purchase history data, recognize repeat and new consumers from the data, and offer them different prices. This is a prevalent practice for firms and a worldwide concern for consumers. Extant research has examined BBP under the assumption that consumers observe firms? practice of BBP. However, consumers do not know that specific firms are doing this and are often unaware of how firms collect and use their data. In this article, the authors examine (1) how firms make BBP decisions when consumers do not observe whether firms perform BBP and (2) how the transparency of firms? BBP practice affects firms and consumers. They find that when consumers do not observe firms? practice of BBP and the cost of implementing BBP is low, a firm indeed practices BBP, even though BBP is a dominated strategy when consumers observe it. When the cost is moderate, the firm does not use BBP; however, it must distort its first-period price downward to signal and convince consumers of its choice. A high cost of implementing BBP serves as a commitment device that the firm will forfeit BBP, thereby improving firm profit. By comparing regimes in which consumers do and do not observe a firm?s practice of BBP, the authors find that transparency of BBP increases firm profit but decreases consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore, requiring firms to disclose collection and usage of consumer data could hurt consumers and lead to unintended consequences.",1
Is a Picture Worth a Thousand Words? An Empirical Study of Image Content and Social Media Engagement,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Are social media posts with pictures more popular than those without? Why do pictures with certain characteristics induce higher engagement than some other pictures? Using data sets of social media posts about major airlines and sport utility vehicle brands collected from Twitter and Instagram, the authors empirically examine the influence of image content on social media engagement. After accounting for selection bias on the inclusion of image content, the authors find a significant and robust positive mere presence effect of image content on user engagement in both product categories on Twitter. They also find that high-quality and professionally shot pictures consistently lead to higher engagement on both platforms for both product categories. However, the effect of colorfulness varies by product category, while the presence of human face and image?text fit can induce higher user engagement on Twitter but not on Instagram. These findings shed light on how to improve social media engagement using image content.",1
The Role of Within-Brand and Cross-Brand Communications in Competitive Growth,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Consumer-generated communication processes have drawn increasing attention of marketers and researchers. However, an underresearched issue is that interpersonal communications are not always brand specific. Thus, a person can adopt a brand either as a result of communication with adopters of that brand (within-brand influence) or as a result of an interaction with adopters of competing brands (cross-brand influence). This study shows that the interplay between within- and cross-brand influence can have a substantial effect on the growth of markets under competition. The authors develop a model that explicitly represents these two influences and focus on the case of two otherwise identical competing brands with different entry times. As a result of within-brand influence, current customers create an interaction-based advantage for the first entrant, which grows with time. Thus, we illustrate how customers should be viewed as market assets who yield increasing returns during the diffusion process. Conversely, cross-brand influence enables a market follower to enjoy a shorter takeoff time. Given the combination of both, the authors predict the ?dual pattern,? characterized by a fast takeoff for a follower, followed by a widening gap in favor of the first entrant, all else being equal. They show that such a pattern dominated the market growth of the cellular industry in Western Europe. They explain the reasons behind this dual pattern, rule out straightforward alternative explanations, and discuss the managerial implications.",0
The Diffusion of Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Many of the products introduced during the past two decades have been services rather than goods. An important influence on the growth and long-term profits of these services is customer attrition, which can occur at the category level (disadoption) or between firms (churn). However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms in a competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firm and apply it to valuation of firms operating in competitive industries. The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role of customer equity in valuations of growing service firms.",1
Decomposing the Value of Word-of-Mouth Seeding Programs: Acceleration versus Expansion,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"In word-of-mouth seeding programs, customer word of mouth can generate value through market expansion; in other words, it can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product. Alternatively, word of mouth can generate value by accelerating the purchases of customers who would have purchased anyway. This article presents the first investigation exploring how acceleration and expansion combine to generate value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. The authors define a program's ?social value? as the global change, over the entire social system, in customer equity that can be attributed to the word-of-mouth program participants. They compute programs? social value in various scenarios using an agent-based simulation model and empirical connectivity data on 12 social networks in various markets as input to the simulation. The authors show how expansion and acceleration integrate to create programs? social value and illustrate how the role of each is affected by factors such as competition, program targeting, profit decline, and retention. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of word-of-mouth marketing programs and of the profit impact of word of mouth in general.",1
The Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility on Customer Donations to Corporate-Supported Nonprofits,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Both theory and recent research evidence suggest that a corporation's socially responsible behavior can positively affect consumers? attitudes toward the corporation. The effect occurs both directly and indirectly through the behavior's effect on customer?corporation identification. The authors report the results of four studies designed to replicate and extend these findings. Using a field survey design, Study 1 provides evidence that perceived corporate social responsibility affects not only customer purchase behavior through customer?corporate identification but also customer donations to corporate-supported nonprofit organizations. Using experimental designs, Studies 2 and 3 replicate and extend the Study 1 findings by providing additional evidence for the mediating role of customer?corporate identification on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer donations. However, the combined results of Studies 2 and 3 also show that because of a ?perceived opportunity to do good? by supporting a company that is changing its ways, consumers are more likely to donate to a corporate-supported nonprofit when the corporation has a weaker historical record of socially responsible behavior. Finally, Study 4 tests the relationship between the nonprofit domain and the domain of the corporation's socially responsible behavior as a boundary condition for this effect.",0
The Influence of Serotonin Deficiency on Choice Deferral and the Compromise Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress, and sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and therefore crucially influence consumer behavior. A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, the authors pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects? cognitive resources. In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects? tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision making.",1
Choice Menus for Mass Customization: An Experimental Approach for Analyzing Customer Demand with an Application to a Web-Based Information Service,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Customers are now active collaborators in creating value. Companies are increasingly engaging in mass customization and offering consumers a ?choiceboard? (or a menu of choices) of various features and options for configuring their own products and services. The authors discuss the use of experimental choice menus for assessing customers' preferences and price sensitivities for the variety of features and options that might be offered by a firm in its choiceboard. The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices. Various technical issues and methodological contributions are discussed. The authors illustrate the approach in a commercial application of a customized Web-based information service, which is typical of offerings in the information economy. To assess predictive performance, the authors compare the proposed approach with alternative traditional approaches. The authors conclude with a discussion of the types of insights that can be obtained from this approach to menu choices and the managerial implications of these findings.",1
Bridging the Academic?Practitioner Divide in Marketing Decision Models,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The marketing decision models field has produced many striking developments that have had a dramatic impact on practice. However, the field has produced orders of magnitude more developments that have received minimal use. In this article, the author notes the many successful marketing model developments but then considers the relatively low level of practical use (trial or adoption) and questions why that is the case. He then suggests how changes in the incentive and reward systems for marketing academics, marketing practitioners, and marketing intermediaries can bring about adoption and implementation improvements that would be mutually beneficial, bridging the academic?practitioner divide. The author also outlines a program of research in the area of the adoption and use of marketing decision models that will provide guidance on what to develop and how to get those developments adopted.",0
Competitive Effects of Front-of-Package Nutrition Labeling Adoption on Nutritional Quality: Evidence from Facts Up Front?Style Labels,Journal of Marketing,2020,"?Facts Up Front? nutrition labels are a front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labeling system that presents key nutrient information on the front of packaged food and beverage products in an easy-to-read format. The authors conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine the effect of adoption of FOP labeling on products? nutritional quality. The authors assemble a unique data set on packaged food products in the United States across 44 categories over 16 years. By using a difference-in-differences estimator, the authors find that FOP adoption in a product category leads to an improvement in the nutritional quality of other products in that category. This competitive response is stronger for premium brands and brands with narrower product line breadth as well as for categories involving unhealthy products and those that are more competitive in nature. The authors offer evidence regarding the role of nutrition information salience as the underlying mechanism; they also perform supplementary analyses to rule out potential self-selection issues and conduct a battery of robustness checks and falsification tests. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for public policy makers, consumers, manufacturers, and food retailers.",0
Customer Satisfaction and Its Impact on the Future Costs of Selling,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Although scholars have established that customer satisfaction affects different dimensions of firm financial performance, a managerially important but overlooked aspect is its effect on a firm?s future cost of selling (COS), that is, expenditures associated with persuading customers and providing convenience to them. Accordingly, this study presents the first empirical and theoretical examination of the impact of customer satisfaction on future COS. The authors propose that while higher customer satisfaction can lower future COS, the degree to which a firm realizes this benefit depends on its strategy and operating environment. Analyzing almost two decades of data from 128 firms, the authors find that customer satisfaction has a statistically and economically significant negative effect on future COS. While the negative effect of customer satisfaction on future COS is weaker for firms with higher capital intensity and financial leverage, this effect is stronger for more diversified firms and for firms operating in industries with higher growth and labor intensity. The authors also find that these effects may vary across two components of COS, cost of persuasion and convenience.",0
Social Loss Aversion and Optimal Contest Design,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"When managers are designing a contest to motivate effort by salespeople, service employees, franchisees, or product development teams, a key question is, What should the optimal proportion of winners and losers be? Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong. Two incentive-aligned experiments show that this prediction can be valid in situations with public announcements of contest outcomes.",1
Designing Sales Contests: Does the Prize Structure Matter?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Sales contests are short-term incentives that managers use to raise sales effort. The extant marketing theory predicts that the optimal prize structure should have two characteristics: (1) The number of prizewinners should be greater than one, and (2) prize values should be unique and rank ordered. However, this theory has not been empirically examined. This article presents two empirical studies that examine whether the prize structure of a sales contest affects sales performance. In each study, the authors investigate the incremental effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one. However, introducing rank-ordered prizes into contests with multiple prizewinners does not boost sales effort and revenues.",1
When Do Group Incentives for Salespeople Work?,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"When should sales managers employ group incentives rather than individual incentives to motivate their sales force? Using economic experiments, the authors show that two-person group incentives can outperform individual incentives and that the relative efficacy of group incentives depends on three important factors. First, the strength of social ties among the group members matters. Effort decisions in group-based incentives increase significantly when members socialize briefly before committing effort. Second, the design of the group incentive matters. For the group incentive to work better than the individual incentive, the group-based component (i.e., how much the payment scheme weights the contribution of others) in the former cannot be too large. Third, the informational feedback that group members receive matters. When socialized group members can observe one another's true effort, rather than only their output, effort surprisingly decreases. The authors show that a model that accounts for social preferences and the psychological loss that occurs when teammates underestimate one's effort can explain salesperson behavior in group incentives well.",1
Package Design as a Communications Vehicle in Cross-Cultural Values Shopping,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Following a strategic approach, the authors test a universal model across cultural groups. They propose that consumers infer brand values (i.e., internal, external, and fun and enjoyment values) from packages and form their purchase intentions on the basis of those values. The authors test this proposition on three culturally diverse subsamples who evaluated three fictional brands each for one hedonic product (chocolate) and one utilitarian product (salt). The results indicate that variances in consumers? use of package-evoked brand values are dependent on culture and are specifically driven by consumer values. The decision-making patterns studied seem to be universal in existence but not in relative or absolute importance. The findings underscore the ability of packages to convey meaning in terms of brand values; they also affirm the role of brand values as predictors of consumer purchase intentions depending on cultural groups. The authors conclude by outlining implications for international brand management and research.",0
Culturally Contingent Electronic Word-of-Mouth Signaling and Screening: A Comparative Study of Product Reviews in the United States and Japan,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) is an important source of influence on consumer decision making, yet little is known about cross-cultural differences in both the occurrence of eWOM and the relationship between eWOM and sales. The authors draw on signaling theory to develop a conceptual model and assess the relationships between country and the occurrence of eWOM, as well as between online ratings and relative product sales according to country. Online reviews and sales rank data for books, CDs, and DVDs were collected from Amazon U.S. and Amazon Japan in 2009 and 2017. Results suggest cross-national differences in both the occurrence of eWOM (eWOM signaling) and the relationship between eWOM and relative product sales (eWOM screening). These national differences appear to change over time: some remain stable, some disappear, and others emerge. The proposed culturally contingent signaling and screening model may be adopted as a framework for future research on cross-cultural eWOM. The results also inform the literature on cultural change by suggesting that cultural differences in eWOM change in nuanced patterns over time.",0
Predicting International Joint Venture Interaction Frequency in U.S.?Chinese Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This research examines the linkages among relationship commitment, cross-cultural adaptation, relational norms, and international joint venture (IJV) interaction frequency. It explores the value of interaction frequency as a performance measure in IJV research and the role of relationship commitment as a key predictor. Cross-cultural adaptation and relational norms are introduced into the commitment?interaction chain because they may reduce cultural dissimilarity and enhance bilateralism, which in turn may promote ongoing interaction. The model is tested empirically using LISREL on U.S.?Chinese IJVs. The results show that relationship commitment positively predicts IJV interaction frequency and cross-cultural adaptation. Although other hypothesized associations are not found, the results provide important practical implications for international marketers.",0
Product Quality Orientation and Its Performance Implications in Chinese State-Owned Enterprises,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"The authors model the performance implications of product quality orientation in Chinese state-owned enterprises and test the implications on a sample of 205 state-owned enterprises. The results show that product quality orientation has a positive impact on performance. This association is moderated by environmental uncertainty: The greater the perceived technological turbulence, the stronger is the relationship of product quality orientation to performance; the greater the perceived market dynamism, the weaker is the relationship. The results also show that the level of product quality orientation is lessened by perceived technological turbulence but enhanced by production routineness. Finally, state-owned enterprise performance is influenced inversely by perceived market dynamism but influenced positively by perceived technological turbulence.",0
Double Standard: The Role of Environmental Consciousness in Green Product Usage,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The results from three studies suggest that consumers? perceptions of product effectiveness are critical in determining the amount of a product they choose to use in a given instance. In general, consumers consider green, or environmentally friendly, products to be less effective than regular products; therefore, consumers increase the amount of the green product they use to make up for the perceived inferiority. Notably, this pattern of green versus regular product usage is more pronounced among consumers who are environmentally conscious. When the perceived effectiveness of a green product is boosted by a credible endorsement, the discrepancy between green and regular product usage disappears.",0
Strong Anxiety Boosts New Product Adoption When Hope Is Also Strong,Journal of Marketing,2020,"New products can evoke anticipatory emotions such as hope and anxiety. On the one hand, consumers might hope that innovative offerings will produce goal-congruent outcomes; on the other hand, they might also be anxious about possible outcomes that are goal-incongruent. The authors demonstrate the provocative and counterintuitive finding that strong anxiety about potentially goal-incongruent outcomes from a new product actually enhances (vs. weakens) consequential adoption intentions (Study 1) and actual adoption (Studies 2 and 3) when hope is also strong. The authors test action planning (a form of elaboration) and perceived control over outcomes as serial mediators to explain this effect. They find that the proposed mechanism holds even after they consider alternative explanations, including pain/gain inferences, confidence in achieving goal-congruent outcomes, global elaboration, affective forecasts, and motivated reasoning. Managerially, the findings suggest that when bringing a new product to market, new product adoption may be greatest when hope and anxiety are both strong. The findings also point to ways in which marketers might enhance hope and/or anxiety, and they suggest that the use of potentially anxiety-inducing tactics such as disclaimers in ads and on packages might not deter adoption when hope is also strong.",0
"Bed and Breakfasts, Small Inns, and the Internet: The Impact of Technology on the Globalization of Small Businesses",Journal of International Marketing,2000,"As the service industry continues to grow, small businesses must decide whether they are going to use new technologies available to them. This article is an exploratory study that examines how the Internet can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) attain a global market. Small inns and bed and breakfasts were used as SMEs in this study. The authors developed a survey and sent it to small inns and bed and breakfasts in Canada and the United States to determine the ways these businesses are using the technologies available to them and the pros and cons of using the technologies. The authors discuss managerial implications of using the Internet.",0
"What Drives a Firm's Choice of Product Recall Remedy? The Impact of Remedy Cost, Product Hazard, and the CEO",Journal of Marketing,2016,"When product recalls occur, companies provide corrective or compensation measures to consumers for the defective products they have purchased. These remedies directly affect consumers and the effectiveness of recall. This article examines the determinants of remedy choices with a theoretical framework rooted in the basic trade-off between remedy cost and consumer harm. In addition to recall and company characteristics, the authors also consider the impact of the CEO's personal incentives. Using recalls issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the authors find that companies prefer to avoid full remedy when remedy cost is high, yet they are more likely to provide full remedy for more severe product hazards. The results show that CEOs? personal interests interfere with remedy decisions: full remedy is less likely when the CEO receives greater cash compensation or less equity incentive, and when the CEO has longer tenure in the position. Importantly, the CEO's financial interests further moderate the effects of remedy cost and consumer harm. The findings have important implications for recall strategy, consumer welfare, public policy, and leadership ethics.",0
Agglomeration as a Driver of the Volume of Electronic Word of Mouth in the Restaurant Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"While previous research has investigated various drivers of electronic word of mouth (eWOM), the firm's offline competitive environment has not been considered. The authors explore this new horizon and examine the different effects of firms? geographic concentration, or agglomeration, on the volume of eWOM received. They distinguish three types of agglomeration?density agglomeration (number of firms in the industry in an area), product agglomeration (overlap in product types offered by the firms in the area), and temporal agglomeration (overlap in moment of consumption). The authors develop hypotheses pertaining to the main effects of the three agglomeration types on eWOM volume, which take the form of an inverted U-shape, and the moderating effect of vertical quality differentiation. The authors test the hypotheses on the volume of eWOM generated per month on Yelp for restaurants in Phoenix, generated by 23,526 users for 2,885 restaurants over an eight-year period. The empirical results broadly support the hypotheses.",1
Optimal Design of Consumer Contests,Journal of Marketing,2007,"A consumer contest is a sales promotion technique that requires participants to apply certain skills as they compete for prizes or awards. This article is the first to employ a game-theoretical approach to investigate consumer contest design issues, including prize structure, segmentation, and handicapping. First, the authors find that both skill distribution and the number of contestants play an important role in determining the optimal prize structure in consumer contests. Specifically, if the skill distribution has the increasing hazard-rate property, it is optimal for a marketer to use a winner-take-all design. In large contests, for the winner-take-all approach to be optimal, it suffices to have the increasing hazard-rate property only at the high end of the skill distribution. Second, increasing contest size is beneficial to the marketer. Third, a less dispersive skill distribution leads to higher consumption by consumers at all skill levels and thus is beneficial to the marketer. The marketer may achieve less dispersive skill distributions by (1) segmenting or screening contestants according to their skill levels and (2) adopting a performance evaluation scheme that handicaps high-skilled contestants.",0
Information Asymmetry and Hybrid Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Pay-for-performance (P4P) pricing schemes such as pay per click and pay per action have increased in popularity in Internet advertising. Meanwhile, pay-per-impression (PPI) schemes persist, and several publishers have begun to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes. Given the proliferation of pricing schemes, this study examines the optimal choices for publishers. The authors highlight two-sided information asymmetries in online advertising markets and the consequent trade-offs faced by a high-quality publisher using P4P schemes. Pay-for-performance schemes enable a high-quality publisher to reveal its superior quality; however, such schemes may incur allocative inefficiencies stemming from inaccurate estimates of advertiser qualities. The authors identify conditions under which a publisher may opt for a PPI, P4P, or hybrid scheme and, in doing so, provide theoretical explanations for the observed variations in the pricing schemes and the increasing popularity of hybrid schemes. Using a new ?uncompromised? equilibrium refinement, the authors find that the hybrid scheme can emerge as an equilibrium choice in a variety of conditions. In addition, they provide prescriptive guidelines for firms choosing between different pricing schemes.",1
Dynamics of Pricing in the Video Game Console Market: Skimming or Penetration?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Nintendo lost its dominant position in the video game industry during the console war between its Nintendo 64 and Sony's PlayStation. However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the console war either with 10% more games or with a ?head start? of one million units in installed base at the time of the PlayStation introduction.",1
Strategic Flexibility and International Venturing by Emerging Market Firms: The Moderating Effects of Institutional and Relational Factors,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Emerging market (EM) firms adopt international venturing strategies as they seek global opportunities, yet research to date has not fully explored the factors driving this phenomenon. Adopting the dynamic capability theory, this study investigates how strategic flexibility affects EM firms in their international venturing efforts and considers critical institutional and relational assets that act as moderators. Data from a sample of 135 Chinese firms with two key informants each indicate that strategic flexibility is positively related to EM firms? international venturing. In addition, high levels of domestic institutional support and strong ties with foreign organizations further enhance this positive linkage. This study adds a dynamic capability view to the explanations for this new phenomenon. The authors conclude with a discussion of contributions, implications, and future directions.",0
"International Retail Sourcing: Trend, Nature, and Process",Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Despite substantial research on international sourcing by manufacturers and the rapid development of international sourcing channels by retailers, both conceptual and empirical studies on international retail sourcing have been few and far between. This article examines current trends of international retail sourcing and draws distinctions between international sourcing by manufacturers and international sourcing by retailers. Drawing upon the disciplines of business strategy, economics, and organizational behavior, it develops a framework for international retail sourcing that links the context, international sourcing strategy, and performance. Based on the literature and in-depth case study interviews, a model of the international retail sourcing process is offered. Implications for researchers and retailers are discussed.",0
Perceived Brand Globalness/Localness: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Directions for Further Research,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Extensive research has investigated how perceived brand globalness (PBG) and perceived brand localness (PBL) affect brand. In this systematic literature review, the authors organize and synthesize the literature on PBG and PBL by analyzing 95 articles published in the past 17 years. They identify similarities, inconsistencies, and omissions in the literature by investigating different conceptualizations of PBG and PBL, boundary conditions of PBG and PBL effects on brand preference, psychological mechanisms through which PBG and PBL affect brand preference, the theoretical foundations underlying PBG and PBL research, and methodological approaches used in the literature. The study outlines avenues for further research based on prior research and current global trends, such as hybridization/glocalization marketing strategies, antiglobalization trends, and digitalization.",0
Understanding Consumer Dynamic Decision Making Under Competing Loyalty Programs,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors develop an incentive-aligned experimental paradigm to study how consumer purchase dynamics are affected by the interplay between competing firms? loyalty programs and their pricing and promotional strategies. In this experiment, participants made sequential choices between two competing airlines in a stylized frequent traveler task for which an optimal dynamic decision policy can be numerically computed. The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants? preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies. Importantly, they find that participants are able to adapt their decision strategies to the environment they face, and thus the overall market outcome and the performance of each firm are influenced by both the competitive environment and the assumption on the extent of consumer optimality.",1
Have you Seen the News Today? The Effect of Death-Related Media Contexts on Brand Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research examines how death-related media contexts affect consumers? preferences for domestic and foreign brands. Four lab and field studies demonstrate that death-related media contexts affect subsequent brand evaluations in distinct ways, which have not yet been documented in the extant literature on media context. First, death-related media contexts shift consumers? preferences in favor of domestic brands by enhancing consumers? patriotism. Second, the death-related media context effect appears only with a temporal delay between the media context and the brand evaluation. Even after a 24-hour delay, the effect still takes place as long as consumers have not been given an opportunity to attenuate death-induced anxiety. Finally, the authors show that foreign brands can counter the negative effects of a death-related media context by making a prodomestic advertising claim.",1
Consumer Responses to High Service Attentiveness: A Cross-Cultural Examination,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Although the literature generally indicates that service attentiveness can increase consumer satisfaction, providing extra care and attention in service encounters may backfire and lead to negative consumer outcomes. In addition, because of cross-cultural differences, the effects of high service attentiveness may vary across international markets. The authors conduct a qualitative study, a field experiment, and two laboratory experiments in three countries (Canada, the United States, and China) across various service contexts (hairdressing, telecommunications, and computer repair) to examine cross-cultural consumer responses toward high service attentiveness. Consumers? negative responses toward high service attentiveness are mediated by their suspicion of ulterior motive, which varies according to their self-construal. Specifically, consumers with an interdependent self-construal (either chronic or primed) tend to have greater suspicion of and negative responses toward high service attentiveness. Furthermore, the effect of interdependent self-construal fostering greater suspicion is attributed to a sharper in-group (vs. out-group) distinction, which is mitigated when the service employee is perceived to be an in-group member. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications and suggesting future research directions.",0
Cutting Calories: The Preference for Lower Caloric Density Versus Smaller Quantities Among Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The marketplace includes many attractive high-calorie indulgent food offerings. Despite their appeal, consumers may often be prompted to consider lower-calorie-package offerings instead (e.g., 100-calorie packs). The question thus arises: What predicts consumers? preferences between different kinds of lower-calorie offerings? The authors conceptualize two different routes to lower-calorie versions of indulgent foods: a lower-caloric-density version (e.g., baked potato chips) or a smaller-portion-size version (e.g., a smaller bag of potato chips). The authors examine how such versions are differentially preferred and why, focusing on the key role of dietary restraint. The authors show that as dietary restraint increases, the preference for a lower-calorie version created via lower caloric density (vs. a smaller portion size) increases. Differential weights placed on health and fullness goals help explain differing preferences across dietary restraint (as the lower-caloric-density version is perceived as healthier and more filling, albeit less tasty, than the smaller-portion-size version). This framework offers theoretical implications for understanding two routes to cutting calories, practical implications for food marketers, and methodological implications for studying food choices.",1
Should Firms Use Small Financial Benefits to Express Appreciation to Consumers? Understanding and Avoiding Trivialization Effects,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Firms commonly add small financial benefits to communications designed to acknowledge consumers' loyalty or support. Yet is it always better to provide some financial benefit as opposed to simply saying ?thank you?? Although this question has important implications for customer relationship management, research has not yet provided an answer. This article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the ?trivialization effect.? The results explain this effect in terms of shifting evaluation standards: whereas a verbal acknowledgement is evaluated relative to verbal gratitude expression norms, a financial acknowledgment is evaluated relative to both verbal norms and customers' monetary expectations. The authors also demonstrate two practical, theory-consistent ways firms can structure financial acknowledgments to eliminate the trivialization effect. Thus, this research shows both the peril of small financial benefits as a means of expressing customer appreciation and practical, low-cost ways to salvage their potential.",0
Mindful Matching: Ordinal Versus Nominal Attributes,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors propose a new conceptual basis for predicting when and why consumers match others? consumption choices. Specifically, they distinguish between ordinal (?ranked?) versus nominal (?unranked?) attributes and propose that consumers are more likely to match others on ordinal than on nominal attributes. Eleven studies involving a range of different ways of operationalizing ordinal versus nominal attributes collectively support this hypothesis. The authors? conceptualization helps resolve divergent findings in prior literature and provides guidance to managers on how to leverage information about prior customers? choices and employees? recommendations to shape and predict future customers? choices. Furthermore, the authors find process evidence that this effect is driven in part by consumers? beliefs that a failure to match on ordinal (but not nominal) attributes will lead to social discomfort for one or both parties. Although the primary focus is on food choices, the effects are also demonstrated in other domains, extending the generalizability of the findings and implications for managerial practice and theory. Finally, the conceptual framework offers additional paths for future research.",1
Where Do You Want to Go for Dinner? A Preference Expression Asymmetry in Joint Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research introduces a framework wherein consumers take on ?requestor? or ?responder? roles in making joint consumption decisions. The authors document a robust preference expression asymmetry wherein ?requestors? soliciting others? consumption preferences (e.g., ?Where do you want to go for dinner??) desire preference expressions (e.g., ?Let?s go to this restaurant?), whereas ?responders? instead do not express preferences (e.g., ?Anywhere is fine with me?). This asymmetry generalizes under a broad set of situations and occurs because the requestor and responder roles differ in their foci. Compared to responders, requestors are more focused on mitigating the difficulty of arriving at a decision, whereas compared to requestors, responders are more focused on conveying likability by appearing easygoing. Responders thus behave suboptimally, incurring a ?preference cost? (when masking preferences) and a ?social friction cost? (requestors favor responders who express preferences). Requestors can elicit preference expression by conveying their own dislike of decision making, which increases responders? focus on mitigating decision difficulty. The authors conclude by discussing the framework?s contributions to looking ?under the hood? of joint consumption decisions.",1
Large-Scale Cross-Category Analysis of Consumer Review Content on Sales Conversion Leveraging Deep Learning,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"How consumers use review content has remained opaque due to the unstructured nature of text and the lack of review-reading behavior data. The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning?based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers? review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.",1
Video Content Marketing: The Making of Clips,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Consumers have an increasingly wide variety of options available to entertain themselves. This poses a challenge for content aggregators who want to effectively promote their video content online through original trailers of movies, sitcoms, and video games. Marketers are now trying to produce much shorter video clips to promote their content on a variety of digital channels. This research is the first to propose an approach to produce such clips and to study their effectiveness, focusing on comedy movies as an application. Web-based facial-expression tracking is used to study viewers? real-time emotional responses when watching comedy movie trailers online. These data are used to predict both viewers? intentions to watch the movie and the movie's box office success. The authors then propose an optimization procedure for cutting scenes from trailers to produce clips and test it in an online experiment and in a field experiment. The results provide evidence that the production of short clips using the proposed methodology can be an effective tool to market movies and other online content.",0
Word of Mouth for Movies: Its Dynamics and Impact on Box Office Revenue,Journal of Marketing,2006,"This article uses actual word-of-mouth (WOM) information to examine the dynamic patterns of WOM and how it helps explain box office revenue. The WOM data were collected from the Yahoo Movies Web site. The results show that WOM activities are the most active during a movie's prerelease and opening week and that movie audiences tend to hold relatively high expectations before release but become more critical in the opening week. More important, WOM information offers significant explanatory power for both aggregate and weekly box office revenue, especially in the early weeks after a movie opens. However, most of this explanatory power comes from the volume of WOM and not from its valence, as measured by the percentages of positive and negative messages.",0
The Long-Term Impact of Loyalty Programs on Consumer Purchase Behavior and Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Despite the prevalent use of loyalty programs, there is limited evidence on the long-term effects of such programs, and their effectiveness is not well established. The current research examines the long-term impact of a loyalty program on consumers' usage levels and their exclusive loyalty to the firm. Using longitudinal data from a convenience store franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm. For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with the firm into other business areas. The findings suggest a need to consider consumer idiosyncrasies when studying loyalty programs and illustrate consumers' cocreation of value in the marketing process.",0
The Effects of Products? Aesthetic Design on Demand and Marketing-Mix Effectiveness: The Role of Segment Prototypicality and Brand Consistency,Journal of Marketing,2017,"A product's physical appearance is difficult to quantify, and the impact of product appearance on demand has rarely been studied using market data. The authors adopt a recently developed morphing technique to measure a product's aesthetic design and investigate its effect on consumer preference. Drawing upon categorization theory, the authors consider the effects of three dimensions of aesthetic design?segment prototypicality (SP), brand consistency (BC), and cross-segment mimicry (CSM)?and their moderating effects on marketing mix effectiveness in a unified framework. The empirical analysis uses a unique, large data set consisting of 202 car models from 33 brands sold in the United States from 2003 to 2010. The authors find that consumer preference peaks at moderate levels of SP and BC and that economy-segment products benefit from CSM of luxury products. Moreover, SP intensifies price sensitivity, and BC muffles price sensitivity while increasing advertising effectiveness. Two what-if studies illustrate how managers can use the empirical model to evaluate alternative aesthetic design choices.",0
Crisis Management Strategies and the Long-Term Effects of Product Recalls on Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Companies increasingly face product harm crises resulting in product recalls, which often have a negative impact on firm value. Whereas prior research has studied the short-term effects of product recalls on firm value, the authors of this article focus on the long-term effects. They develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses about the main effect of recall volume and the moderating effects of crisis management strategies on the relationship between recall volume and long-term firm value. They empirically test the hypotheses in the auto industry context using both short-term abnormal returns analysis and long-term calendar-time portfolio analysis of 280 product recalls during 2005?2015. The findings reveal that the negative impact of product recall volume lingers over time. Brand (promotion) advertising has a significant positive (negative) effect on the relationship between recall volume and long-term abnormal returns. Furthermore, both voluntary recall initiation and postrecall remedial efforts positively moderate the impact of recall volume on long-term returns. These moderating effects are contrary to those in the short term. The results suggest that managers should use different advertising types during and after a recall, strategically initiate recalls, and diligently prepare postrecall remedies to mitigate the negative effects of recall volume on long-term return.",0
"Competing Loyalty Programs: Impact of Market Saturation, Market Share, and Category Expandability",Journal of Marketing,2009,"Loyalty programs have become an important component of firms? relationship management strategies. There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a non-competitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.",0
Not All Repeat Customers Are the Same: Designing Effective Cross-Selling Promotion on the Basis of Attitudinal Loyalty and Habit,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Not all repeat purchases are created equal. They can be driven by both positive reaction toward a brand (i.e., attitudinal loyalty) and automaticity triggered by non-brand-related contextual cues (i.e., habit). Combining the loyalty literature with recent habit research, the authors suggest ways to distinguish the two drivers of repeat purchase and examine how they affect consumer response to cross-selling promotions. In Study 1, the authors propose a method to derive individual-level habit strength from consumer transaction records and demonstrate the influence of both attitudinal loyalty and habit on repeat purchase. Studies 2a and 2b then show that attitudinal loyalty facilitates cross-selling, whereas habit has the opposite effect. Finally, in Study 3, the authors suggest a specific promotional design that works better for habitual consumers than for those with attitudinal loyalty and demonstrate that ignoring these two underlying drivers can lead to unintended negative consequences on consumer behavior. This research adds to a richer understanding of repatronage and yields important managerial insights into more effective cross-selling to repeat customers.",0
How to Attract Customers by Giving Them the Short End of the Stick,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Several influential streams of research in marketing, psychology, and economics conclude that when an offer a seller makes to a buyer is held fixed, the buyer will be repelled if he or she learns that some other group of buyers is getting a better price for the same benefits or receiving more benefits for the same price. Prior work has attributed this repulsion to perceptions that the offer is inequitable, that it fits others better, or that it suggests that the core product is of low value. In six experiments, the authors show conditions under which exactly the opposite can occur; that is, consumers judge the same offer to be more attractive when a seller offers a better price or more benefits to another group than when the seller treats everyone equally.",1
The Incentive and Selection Roles of Sales Force Compensation Contracts,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Designing compensation plans with an appropriate level of incentives is a key decision faced by managers of direct sales forces. The authors use data on individual salesperson compensation contracts to show that firms design their pay plans to both discriminatingly select (i.e., attract and retain) salespeople and provide them with the right level of incentives. Consistent with standard agency arguments, the authors find that firms use higher-powered incentives as the importance of agent effort increases. At the same time, the authors find strong support for the selection role of these contracts. Specifically, agents with greater selling ability and lower risk aversion are associated with jobs offering higher-powered incentives. Finally, consistent with prior findings on incentive contracts, the authors find no support for the insurance implication of the typical agency model. The authors rule out alternative explanations for this anomalous result and find that the selection role of contracts best explains the result in their context.",1
What Happens Online Stays Online? Segment-Specific Online and Offline Effects of Banner Advertisements,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Many firms are allocating increasing parts of their advertising budgets to banner advertising. Yet, for firms that predominantly sell offline, existing research provides little guidance on online advertising decisions. In this study, the authors analyze the impact of banner advertising on consumers? online and offline behavior across multiple distinct campaigns for one focal firm, which predominantly sells through the offline channel. Results suggest that banner and TV advertising increase website visit incidence for consumers who have not visited the focal firm's website in the previous four weeks (nonrecent online consumers). For these consumers, banner and TV advertisements indirectly increase offline sales through website visits. For consumers who have visited the firm's website in the previous four weeks (recent online consumers), the authors find evidence for a cross-campaign, brand-building effect of banner advertising, and TV ads also directly affect offline purchases. Overall, the findings indicate that for firms that predominantly (or even exclusively) sell offline, banner advertising is most suitable to generate awareness for a firm's new products among nonrecent online consumers, and to build their brand(s) among recent online consumers.",1
Another Reason Academics and Practitioners Should Communicate More,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Bronnenberg, Dhar, and Dub (2007) show that there is a large geographic variation in market shares and perceived quality levels of a large sample of ?national? and ?regional? brands across many consumer packaged good categories, and they demonstrate that their geographic findings are new to academics. In this comment, the author shows that practice has been ahead of academics in this basic understanding. He then shows how a point of real leverage is to allocate marketing resources geographically on the basis of market response. There seems to be as much or more variation in market response to resources such as advertising and promotion as there is in market shares. This comment concludes with a plea for more interaction between academics and practitioners.",1
The Repetition-Break Plot Structure Makes Effective Television Advertisements,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The plot structure in television advertisements can enhance consumers? brand attitudes and foster increasing consumer and industry recognition. A corpus analysis of contemporary television advertisements shows that advertisements using the repetition-break plot structure are a small percentage of television advertisements but a large percentage of Clio and Effie award?winning advertisements. They are also likely to attain postings and views on YouTube. Three experiments using television advertisements from contemporary brands show that repetition-break advertisements are persuasive, leading to more favorable brand attitudes and greater purchase intentions than similar plot structures and that this effect is attributable in part to the advertisements being more engaging. Thus, a theoretically explainable and generic plot structure yields effective advertisements. The result is a new and flexible tool for marketing professionals to use to generate advertisements, with guidelines for when and why it should and should not be effective.",0
Circle of Incompetence: Sense of Understanding as an Improper Guide to Investment Risk,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Consumers incorrectly rely on their sense of understanding of what a company does to evaluate investment risk. In three correlational studies, greater sense of understanding was associated with lower risk ratings (Study 1) and with prediction distributions of future stock performance that had lower standard deviations and higher means (Studies 2 and 3). In all studies, sense of understanding was unassociated with objective risk measures. Risk perceptions increased when the authors degraded sense of understanding by presenting company information in an unstructured versus structured format (Study 4). Sense of understanding also influenced downstream investment decisions. In a portfolio construction task, both novices and seasoned investors allocated more money to hard-to-understand companies for a risk-tolerant client relative to a risk-averse one (Study 5). Study 3 ruled out an alternative explanation based on familiarity. The results may explain both the enduring popularity and common misinterpretation of the ?invest in what you know? philosophy.",1
Artificial Intelligence in Utilitarian vs. Hedonic Contexts: The ?Word-of-Machine? Effect,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel ?word-of-machine? effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1?4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person?s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human?AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a?b).",0
The Impact of Category Prices on Store Price Image Formation: An Empirical Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors empirically explore how consumers update beliefs about a store's overall expensiveness. They estimate a learning model of store price image (SPI) formation with the impact of actual prices linked to category characteristics on a unique data set combining consumers? store visit and purchase information with their price perceptions. The results identify characteristics that drive categories? store price signaling power for different store formats. ?Big ticket? categories with a narrow price range strongly shape consumers? store price beliefs, whereas (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less influential. At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for which quality differentiation is high. For hard discounters, however, SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. Notably, categories? SPI signaling power is not proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain. Managers can use these results to identify ?Lighthouse? categories that signal low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending, and in which price cuts do not overly hurt revenue.",1
On Brands and Word of Mouth,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Brands and word of mouth (WOM) are cornerstones of the marketing field, and yet their relationship has received relatively little attention. This study aims to enhance understanding of brand characteristics as antecedents of WOM by executing a comprehensive empirical analysis. For this purpose, the authors constructed a unique data set on online and offline WOM and characteristics for more than 600 of the most talked-about U.S. brands. To guide this empirical analysis, they present a theoretical framework arguing that consumers spread WOM on brands as a result of social, emotional, and functional drivers. Using these drivers, the authors identify a set of 13 brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, including three (level of differentiation, excitement, and complexity) that have not been studied to date as WOM antecedents. The authors find that whereas the social and functional drivers are the most important for online WOM, the emotional driver is the most important for offline WOM. These results provide an insightful perspective on WOM and have meaningful managerial implications for brand management and investment in WOM campaigns.",1
Sounds Big: The Effects of Acoustic Pitch on Product Perceptions,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"There is meaning in sound that transcends language. Structural differences in the sound of a spokesperson's voice or a piece of background music can influence a consumer's perception of product attributes through cross-modal inference. This article examines how differences in acoustic pitch in marketing communications influence consumer's perceptions of product size. Through six studies, the authors find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence shows that this pitch?size effect occurs through a process of visual mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information. The cross-modal effects between auditory stimuli and physical products represent an unexplored influence on consumer perception and behavior with important managerial and theoretical implications.",1
Exploitation and Exploration in International Joint Ventures: Moderating Effects of Partner Control Imbalance and Product Similarity,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"International joint ventures (IJVs) need to exploit their existing resources as well as explore new capabilities to capture the potential in emerging markets. This study develops a contingent view, arguing that the efficacy of exploitation and exploration depends on the levels of control imbalance and product similarity between an IJV's foreign and local partners. A sample of 198 IJVs in China reveals that partner control imbalance has a U-shaped moderating effect on the relationship between exploitation and IJV new product performance but has an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on the effectiveness of exploration. Exploitation relates more strongly to IJV new product performance when partner product similarity is high, whereas exploration has a stronger impact on IJV new product performance at low levels of partner product similarity. These findings provide novel insights for IJVs to better manage exploitation and exploration in their new product development.",0
Forecasting Marketing-Mix Responsiveness for New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Before a new product launch, marketers need to infer how demand will respond to various levels of marketing-mix variables to set an appropriate marketing plan. A critical challenge in estimating marketing-mix responsiveness from historical data is that the observed decisions were affected by private information possessed by managers about the heterogeneous effects of marketing-mix variables on sales. The authors refer to this as the ?slope endogeneity? problem. Such endogeneity differs from the ?intercept endogeneity? problem, which has been widely acknowledged in the literature. To correct for the slope endogeneity bias, the authors develop a conceptually simple control function approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and marketing-mix carryover effects. The method is applied to forecasting advertising responsiveness in the U.S. DVD market. The results suggest that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles and that estimated marketing-mix elasticities would be biased if the slope endogeneity problem were ignored. This analysis also yields findings of substantive interest to researchers and managers involved in entertainment marketing.",1
The Sustainability Liability: Potential Negative Effects of Ethicality on Product Preference,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Manufacturers are increasingly producing and promoting sustainable products (i.e., products that have a positive social and/or environmental impact). However, relatively little is known about how product sustainability affects consumers? preferences. The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the ?sustainability liability?). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength.",0
More than Words: The Influence of Affective Content and Linguistic Style Matches in Online Reviews on Conversion Rates,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.",0
Let the Logo Do the Talking: The Influence of Logo Descriptiveness on Brand Equity,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Logos frequently include textual and/or visual design elements that are descriptive of the type of product/service that brands market. However, knowledge about how and when logo descriptiveness can influence brand equity is limited. Using a multimethod research approach across six studies, the authors demonstrate that more (vs. less) descriptive logos can positively influence brand evaluations, purchase intentions, and brand performance. They also demonstrate that these effects occur because more (vs. less) descriptive logos are easier to process and thus elicit stronger impressions of authenticity, which consumers value. Furthermore, two important moderators are identified: the positive effects of logo descriptiveness are considerably attenuated for brands that are familiar (vs. unfamiliar) to consumers and reversed (i.e., negative) for brands that market a type of product/service linked with negatively (vs. positively) valenced associations in consumers? minds. Finally, an analysis of 597 brand logos suggests that marketing practitioners might not fully take advantage of the potential benefits of logo descriptiveness. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.",1
The Visual Asymmetry Effect: An Interplay of Logo Design and Brand Personality on Brand Equity,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Five studies using a variety of experimental approaches and secondary data sets show that a visual property present in all brand logos?the degree of (a)symmetry?can interact with brand personality to affect brand equity. Specifically, compared with symmetrical logos, asymmetrical logos tend to be more arousing, leading to increased perceptions of excitement. As such, consumers tend to perceive asymmetrical logos as more congruent with brands that have an exciting personality. This can boost consumers? evaluations and the market?s financial valuations of such brands, a phenomenon referred to as the ?visual asymmetry effect.? The studies also show that this interplay between brand personality and logo design occurs only for the personality of excitement and the visual property of asymmetry. These findings add to theories of visual design and branding and offer actionable insights to marketing practitioners.",1
Stakeholder Orientation and Business Performance: The Case of Service Companies in China,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Previous research on stakeholder orientation has examined only the main effects of its components on business performance. However, the interaction effects that result from different combinations of the components of stakeholder orientation have been overlooked. This article proposes and tests two types of interaction effects, synergy and hindering effects, using a sample of 193 service companies in China.",0
Why do Customers Get more than They Need? How Organizational Culture Shapes Product Capability Decisions,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The capability level of a product that a firm provides to a customer is an important marketing decision. In the extant literature, the normative heuristic for this decision is one of matching?of providing product capability levels that meet customer needs. However, industry evidence suggests that supplier firms routinely make product decisions that lead to ?overshot? customers, whereby customers receive products with capabilities that exceed their requirements. The authors demonstrate how a supplier firm's organizational culture can cause overshooting scenarios and how these effects can be attenuated to the extent that the focal firm's basic values also reflect a customer orientation.",0
Managing Revenue across Retail Channels: The Interplay of Service Performance and Direct Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Increased internal pressure to make marketing accountable, combined with market pressure from the proliferation of new service delivery channels, requires retailers to better understand the differential impacts of marketing efforts across channels now more than ever. In this article, the authors (1) develop and test a theoretically grounded framework for the interplay of objective service performance and direct marketing in shaping retail revenue over time through two distinct service delivery channels (on-site and remote) and (2) conceptualize service delivery channel?specific servicescapes as facilitative mechanisms for the effectiveness of objective service performance and direct marketing. The authors test the conceptual framework with multisource data from a major national pizza retailer comprising a field study based on a time series of 223 weeks across five stores of objective marketing and performance data (delivery time) and a cross-sectional survey of the retailer's customers. They find that objective service performance and direct marketing interact by exhibiting a trade-off effect contingent on specific aspects of the servicescape. When both objective service performance and direct marketing levels are high, servicescape quality design perceptions alleviate the trade-off effect in on-site delivery channels, and servicescape time/effort cost perceptions do so in remote delivery channels. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",0
Culture's Impact on the Importance of Fairness in Interorganizational Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Research on interorganizational relationships is predicated on the idea that fairness is always important. The authors question this assumption because most fairness research has been conducted in Western countries, and mixed empirical support draws into question how important fairness actually is. Drawing on Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework, the authors examine culture as an antecedent to the importance of outcome fairness (OF) and procedural fairness (PF) in retailers? assessments of their relationships with suppliers. The authors also propose that cultural exposure moderates the impact of culture on fairness importance. Using responses from retailers in ten countries analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling, the authors find that uncertainty avoidance enhances the importance of OF and PF, power distance marginally decreases the importance of PF, and long-term orientation increases the importance of both OF and PF. Cultural exposure also positively moderates the impact of uncertainty avoidance and masculinity on both fairness types. The pattern of effects is robust when compared with two alternative models. This study offers a first step in understanding culture's impact on when fairness is more or less important.",0
Recovering Hidden Buyer?Seller Relationship States to Measure the Return on Marketing Investment in Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"For two reasons, marketers face significant challenges in measuring return on marketing investment in business-to-business (B2B) markets. First, buyers often have irregular purchase patterns, as the authors observe in the high-tech industry. Second, marketing efforts take considerable time to build a relationship with a customer. The authors attempt to precisely recover hidden buyer?seller relationship states to capture the effect of marketing contacts in B2B markets. The authors build a comprehensive hierarchical Bayesian bivariate Tobit hidden Markov model to assess the return on marketing in B2B markets. They use a recursive computing method?a forward?backward Gibbs sampler method?to retrieve the relationship states. The results suggest that marketing contacts have a heterogeneous long- and short-term impact on customers' purchasing behavior through changes in the buyer?seller relationship states. This study provides practical value to business marketers to measure the return on marketing investment in buyer?seller relationships.",1
Product Line Design for Consumer Durables: An Integrated Marketing and Engineering Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Product line design for consumer durables often relies on close coordination between marketing and engineering domains. Product lines that evolve as optimal from marketers? perspective may not be optimal from an engineering viewpoint, and vice versa. Although extant research has proposed sophisticated techniques to handle problems that characterize each individual domain, the majority of these developments have not addressed the interdependent issues across marketing and engineering. The author presents a product line optimization method that enables managers to simultaneously consider factors deemed important from both marketing and engineering domains. One major advantage of this method is that it takes into account the strategic reactions from the incumbent manufacturers and the retailer in the design of the product line. The author demonstrates in a simulation study that this method is applicable to problems with a reasonably large scale. Using data collected in a power tool development project undertaken by a major U.S. manufacturer, the study illustrates that the proposed method leads to a more profitable product line than alternative approaches that consider requirements from these two domains separately.",1
Dilution and Enhancement of Celebrity Brands through Sequential Movie Releases,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article examines the effects of sequential movie releases on the dilution and enhancement of celebrity brands. The authors use favorability ratings collected over a 12-year period (1993?2005) to capture movement in the brand equity of a panel of actors. They use a dynamic panel data model to investigate how changes of brand equity are associated with the sequence of movies featuring these actors, after controlling for the possible influence from the stars? off-camera activities. The authors also examine the underlying factors that influence the magnitude and longevity of such effects. In contrast with findings from existing research in product branding, the authors find evidence that supports the general existence of dilution and enhancement effects on the equity of a celebrity brand through his or her movie appearances. They also find that star favorability erodes substantially over time. Finally, this research offers insights for actors regarding how to make movie selections strategically to maximize their brand equity.",1
Incorporating Subjective Characteristics in Product Design and Evaluations,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Consumers often use both objective and subjective criteria to evaluate a product. For example, power tool users may evaluate a power tool on the basis of not only its objective attributes, such as price and switch type, but also its subjective characteristics, such as ease of use and feel of the tool. This research emphasizes incorporating subjective characteristics in new product design. The authors propose a model in which consumers' purchase intentions can be affected by both the objective attributes and the subjective characteristics. This model has the form of a hierarchical Bayesian structural equation model, in which the subjective characteristics are treated as latent constructs. The authors also propose a Bayesian forecasting procedure in which the estimated relationships are used to improve the out-of-sample prediction. They illustrate the proposed approach in two empirical studies. The results indicate that by collecting additional information about consumers' perceptions of the subjective characteristics, the proposed model provides the product designer with a better understanding and a more accurate prediction of consumers' product preferences than the traditional conjoint models.",1
Why We Do What We Do: A Model of Activity Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Consumers' time allocation decisions among various activities are fundamental to marketing research and consumer behavior. The authors construct a dynamic panel data model to examine how consumers allocate time to a portfolio of leisure activities over time. The data comprise a longitudinal panel in which the authors tracked 287 U.S. consumers' time use, consumption motives, and expertise measures on a weekly basis from January to June 2011. This is the first empirical research to examine the underlying mechanisms that guide the dynamics of an individual's activity consumption. The authors demonstrate that expertise contributes to the perceived benefits of an activity, which in turn leads to high value associated with it. Expertise also directly influences value obtained from an activity. This expertise, in turn, is acquired over time through past consumption. This finding implies a chain from expertise to value to time use and back to expertise, which may lead consumers to form a lifestyle in which they specialize in a subset of activities they know well. Consequently, expertise can be regarded as a key variable that explains lifestyle choices.",1
Improving Online Idea Generation Platforms and Customizing the Task Structure on the Basis of Consumers' Domain-Specific Knowledge,Journal of Marketing,2015,"The authors explore how firms can enhance consumer performance in online idea generation platforms. Most, if not all, online idea generation platforms offer all consumers identical tasks in which (1) participants are granted access to ideas from other participants and (2) ideas are classified into categories, but consumers can navigate freely across idea categories. The former is linked to stimulus ideas, and the latter may be viewed as a first step toward problem decomposition. The authors propose that the effects of both stimulus ideas and problem decomposition are moderated by consumers' domain-specific knowledge. In particular, concrete cues such as stimulus ideas are more beneficial to low-knowledge consumers, and high-knowledge consumers are better served with abstract cues such as the ones offered by problem decomposition. The authors' hypotheses are supported by an extensive empirical investigation involving more than 6,000 participants. The findings suggest that online idea generation platforms should use problem decomposition more explicitly and that firms should not immediately show other participants' ideas to high-knowledge consumers when they access the platform. In other words, online idea generation platforms should customize the task structure on the basis of each participant's domain-specific knowledge.",0
Consumer Negative Voice and Firm-Idiosyncratic Stock Returns,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Prior research has largely focused on the positive side of customer experience, such as satisfaction. In contrast, this study investigates the negative side of customer experience and tests the harmful impact of consumer negative voice on firms' stock returns. Based on a longitudinal real-world data set that matches consumer negative voice (complaint records) in the airline industry with firm stock prices, this article finds that higher levels of current consumer negative voice harm firms' future idiosyncratic stock returns. In addition, this harmful impact is robust (albeit different across airline companies) after latent heterogeneity and traditional finance fundamentals are considered. These findings enable marketers and corporate financers to be more confident with customer equity theory and customer relationship management. In addition, armed with ?hard? data (record-based, longitudinal), this research helps relieve criticisms against prior studies that are based on ?soft? data (survey-based, cross-sectional). To financial analysts, this research suggests that, all else being equal, they should rate downward the stocks of firms that are shadowed by harmful consumer negative voice. In today's high-tech environment with blogs and online forums, the damage caused by negative voice may be nontrivial and should not be ignored. Overall, this research demonstrates to managers that investments in reducing consumer negative voice could indeed make financial sense in terms of promoting firm-idiosyncratic stock returns.",0
When Marketing Strategy First Meets Wall Street: Marketing Spendings and Firms? Initial Public Offerings,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article examines the role of marketing in the context of initial public offerings (IPOs), a neglected issue in the extant literature. The results from a large-scale, cross-industry study indicate that firms? pre-IPO marketing spendings help reduce IPO underpricing and boost IPO trading in the stock market. The econometric models also suggest that these effects are heterogeneous; that is, they are more salient for firms with higher cost reduction efficiency and in markets with a smaller number of historical IPOs. With regard to theory, this research ushers in a greenfield of IPOs, helping build more powerful theories of market-based assets and customer equity. With regard to practice, it builds the case for not cutting marketing before an IPO. Prudent investors may be better able to pick ?star? IPOs if they can track pre-IPO marketing spendings and model firm cost reduction efficiency simultaneously. Overall, this article offers fresh implications for the marketing?finance interface, uncovering brand-new IPO-based reasons that marketing can help create shareholder value.",0
Group-Buying Deal Popularity,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Group-buying (GB) deals entail a two-phase decision process. First, consumers decide whether to buy a deal. Second, they decide when to redeem the deal, conditional on purchase. Guided by theories of social influence and observational learning, the authors develop a framework predicting that (1) deal popularity increases consumers? purchase likelihood and decreases redemption time, conditional on purchase, and (2) the social influence?related factors of referral intensity and group consumption amplify these effects. The authors test this framework and support it using a unique data set of 30,272 customers of a GB website with several million data points. Substantially, these findings reveal a two-phase perspective of GB, longevity effects of deal popularity, and the amplifying role of customer referrals (influencing others) in the effects of deal popularity (others? influence). In light of the criticism of GB industry practice, this study builds the case for GB websites and merchants to heed deal popularity information and the social influence?related contingencies.",0
"Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Satisfaction, and Market Value",Journal of Marketing,2006,"Although prior research has addressed the influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on perceived customer responses, it is not clear whether CSR affects market value of the firm. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) customer satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between CSR and firm market value (i.e., Tobin's q and stock return), (2) corporate abilities (innovativeness capability and product quality) moderate the financial returns to CSR, and (3) these moderated relationships are mediated by customer satisfaction. Based on a large-scale secondary data set, the results show support for this framework. Notably, the authors find that in firms with low innovativeness capability, CSR actually reduces customer satisfaction levels and, through the lowered satisfaction, harms market value. The uncovered mediated and asymmetrically moderated results offer important implications for marketing theory and practice.",0
"The Debate over Doing Good: Corporate Social Performance, Strategic Marketing Levers, and Firm-Idiosyncratic Risk",Journal of Marketing,2009,"Marketers and investors face a heated, provocative debate over whether excelling in social responsibility initiatives hurts or benefits firms financially. This study develops a theoretical framework that predicts (1) the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on firm-idiosyncratic risk and (2) the role of two strategic marketing levers, advertising and research and development (R&D), in explaining the variability of this impact among different firms. The results show that higher CSP lowers undesirable firm-idiosyncratic risk. Notably, although the salutary impact of CSP is greater in firms with higher (versus lower) advertising, a simultaneous pursuit for CSP, advertising, and R&D is harmful with increased firm-idiosyncratic risk. For theory, the authors advance the literature on the marketing?finance interface by drawing attention to the risk-reduction potential of CSP and by shedding new light on some critical but neglected roles of strategic marketing levers. They also extend CSP research by moving away from the long-fought battle for a universal CSP impact and toward a finer-grained understanding of when some firms derive more risk-reduction benefits from CSP. For practice, the results indicate that the ?goodwill refund? of CSP is not unconditional. They also empower marketers to communicate more effectively with investors (i.e., doing good to better manage the risk surrounding firm stock prices).",0
Marketing's Credibility: A Longitudinal Investigation of Marketing Communication Productivity and Shareholder Value,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Practitioners and scholars have questioned marketing communication's credibility because it has not been linked to firm shareholder value. Using secondary longitudinal data, the authors show that the impact of marketing communication productivity (MCP) on shareholder value is positive and nonlinear. In particular, the influence of MCP on the forward-looking performances of Tobin's q and stock return is curvilinear with an inverted U shape. The authors also investigate the moderating role of research-and-development investment and competitive intensity. The findings have implications for marketing managers regarding how to model and benchmark MCP and the dangers of blindly improving the productivity of advertising and sales promotion expenditures.",0
The Effects of Customer Relationships and Social Capital on Firm Performance: A Chinese Business Illustration,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"The authors use the resource-based view of the firm to frame the direct, relative, and synergistic effects of three firm relational resources (i.e., customer relationships, business-partner social capital, and governing-agency social capital) on firm performance (strategic and financial) in a sample of 262 businesses that operate in metropolitan Chinese cities. Although the findings indicate that all three relational resources enhance performance, they also indicate that customer relationships are the primary drivers of strategic and financial performance and that business partnerships and governing-agency social capital have a synergistic influence. In addition, the results indicate that the influences of these resources are moderated by domestic or international firm ownership. The authors discuss the implications for academics and practitioners.",0
Neglected Outcomes of Customer Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Although there is significant evidence that customer satisfaction is an important driver of firm profitability, extant literature has largely neglected two intermediate outcomes of customer satisfaction, namely, a firm's advertising and promotion efficiency and its human capital performance. On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel, indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their dialogue with financial executives and human resources managers.",0
"Satisfaction, Complaint, and the Stock Value Gap",Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article introduces the concept of a stock value gap?the shortfall of a firm's actual market value from its optimal market value, as measured by a best-performing benchmark. Using a large-scale, real-world database, the authors test the effects of both customer satisfaction and customer complaint on the stock value gap of firms. The results show that customer complaint has a stronger effect than customer satisfaction on the value gap. Furthermore, there is some support for the moderating influences of working capital and firm specialization. The results provide actionable guidelines to build a more complete customer equity dashboard and encourage managers to provide a supportive organizational environment to create shareholder value.",0
"Customer Satisfaction, Analyst Stock Recommendations, and Firm Value",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Although managers are interested in the financial value of customers and researchers have pointed out the importance of stock analysts who advise investors, no studies to date have explored the implications of customer satisfaction for analyst stock recommendations. Using a large-scale longitudinal data set, the authors find that positive changes in customer satisfaction not only improve analyst recommendations but also lower dispersion in those recommendations for the firm. These effects are stronger when product market competition is high and financial market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendations at least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value. Thus, if analysts pay attention to Main Street customer satisfaction, Wall Street investors should have good reason to listen and follow. Overall, this research reveals the impact of satisfaction on analyst-based outcomes and firm value metrics and calls attention to the construct of customer satisfaction as a key intangible asset for the investor community.",1
The Impact of Brand Rating Dispersion on Firm Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"This study examines brand dispersion?variance in brand ratings across consumers?and its role in the translation of brand assets into firm value. Dispersion captures the covert heterogeneity in brand evaluations among consumers who like or dislike the brands, which would affect an investor's decision to buy or sell a stock. The higher the dispersion, the more inconsistent and polarized the brands? cross-consumer ratings. Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand?day observations provide robust evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run. Without modeling dispersion, brand rating's impact on firm value can be over- or underestimated. Managers should consider dispersion a vital brand-management metric and add it to the brand-performance dashboard.",1
Working with Rivals: The Impact of Competitor Alliances on Financial Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"To survive and prosper in today's highly competitive environment, firms are increasingly engaging in cooperative alliances with their rivals. However, the impact of these competitor alliances on financial performance is largely unknown. This research examines this issue. Using both survey and archival data, the authors conduct two studies that reveal that the intensity of a firm's alliances with its competitors has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) influence on return on equity. In addition, the authors find that a firm's competitor orientation, as embodied in its strategies and objectives, can strengthen or weaken this curvilinear effect. Overall, these findings indicate that both competition and cooperation have dark sides that a firm must carefully manage when working with rivals.",1
Cross-Functional ?Coopetition?: The Simultaneous Role of Cooperation and Competition within Firms,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Extant marketing literature tends to view cross-functional relationships as primarily cooperative or competitive in nature, but not both. In contrast, this research focuses on cross-functional ?coopetition? (i.e., the joint occurrence of cooperation and competition across functional areas within a firm). Using responses from midlevel managers and top executives, the authors find that cross-functional coopetition enhances a firm's customer and financial performance. The authors further show that this influence is mediated by market learning, indicating that performance returns to cross-functional coopetition occurs through an underlying learning mechanism.",0
The Impact of Platform Protection Insurance on Buyers and Sellers in the Sharing Economy: A Natural Experiment,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The sharing economy has radically reshaped marketing thought and practice, and research has yet to examine whether and how platform-level buyer protection insurance (PPI) affects buyers and sellers in this economy. The authors exploit a natural experiment involving an unexpected system glitch during a PPI launch and estimate difference-in-differences models using over 5.4 million data points from a food sharing platform. Results suggest that PPI significantly increases buyer spending and seller revenue, affirming the benefits of this platform-level insurance in the sharing economy. The authors also uncover multifaceted buyer-side and seller-side responses that enable such benefits. PPI increases buyer spending by boosting product orders and variety-seeking behavior. Furthermore, it enhances seller revenue by increasing customer retention and acquisition. This work contributes to the literature by (1) putting a spotlight on the topic of PPI, a platform governance policy that reduces consumer risks and improves the efficacy of sharing platforms; (2) accounting for how PPI alters buyer and seller behaviors on a platform; (3) addressing what types of buyers and sellers benefit more or less from PPI; and (4) offering guidance for managers to improve platform reputation, marketplace efficiency, and consumer welfare in the context of the sharing economy.",0
Visual Representation: Implications for Decision Making,Journal of Marketing,2007,"A large number of visualization tools have been created to help decision makers understand increasingly rich databases of product, customer, sales force, and other types of marketing information. This article presents a framework for thinking about how visual representations are likely to affect the decision processes or tasks that marketing managers and consumers commonly face, particularly those that involve the analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. From this framework, the authors derive a set of testable propositions that serve as an agenda for further research. Although visual representations are likely to improve marketing manager efficiency, offer new insights, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, they may also bias decisions by focusing attention on a limited set of alternatives, increasing the salience and evaluability of less diagnostic information, and encouraging inaccurate comparisons. Given this, marketing managers are advised to subject insights from visual representations to more formal analysis.",0
Marketing Scholarship 2.0,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The system for the design, production, and dissemination of marketing scholarship aimed at contributing to marketing practice is under increasing strain due to pressures exerted by globalization, digitization, and environmentalism. Scholarly research in marketing adheres largely to a twentieth-century manufacturing model. Change is needed now. Marketing scholarship can benefit from embracing a twenty-first-century, collaborative approach to the conception, design, and dissemination of research. ?Crowdsourcing? is becoming a frequently employed strategy in industry. Marketing academe should adopt some of the same techniques and technologies to make stronger research contributions that will benefit marketing practice. In particular, more collaboration is needed, both among academic researchers and between academe and industry, to be sure important problems are being investigated using sound theories and methods. An open, collaborative model will allow the field to evolve from Marketing Scholarship 1.0 to Marketing Scholarship 2.0.",0
When Sex and Romance Conflict: The Effect of Sexual Imagery in Advertising on Preference for Romantically Linked Products and Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Sex is ubiquitous in advertising, yet little research has explored the effect of exposure to sexual imagery on preferences. Although sex and romance tend to go together in real-world relationships, the authors find that exposure to sex-based ads decreases preference for romantically linked products and services in men. Furthermore, the authors find that the effect is one directional, such that exposure to romantic imagery in ads does not decrease men's preference for sex-related products. Finally, the authors find that exposure to sex-based ads does not lead to a decreased preference for romantically linked products in women. The authors explain this pattern of results through the relatively opportunistic nature of the sex drive in men. They close with a discussion about implications for theories of fundamental motives and for the effect of sex-based advertisements on dating and relationships.",1
An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Gasoline Prices on Grocery Shopping Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The authors empirically examine the effect of gas prices on grocery shopping behavior using Information Resources Inc. panel data from 2006 to 2008, which track panelists? purchases of almost 300 product categories across multiple retail formats. The authors quantify the impact on consumers? total spending and examine the potential avenues for savings when consumers shift from one retail format to another, from national brands to private labels, from regular-priced to promotional products, and from higher to lower price tiers. They find a substantial negative effect on shopping frequency and purchase volume and shifts away from grocery and toward supercenter formats. A greater shift occurs from regular-priced national brands to promoted ones than to private labels, and among national brand purchasers, bottom-tier brands lose share, midtier brands gain share, and top-tier brand share is relatively unaffected. The analysis also controls for general economic conditions and shows that gas prices have a much larger impact on grocery shopping behavior than broad economic factors.",0
Soda versus Cereal and Sugar versus Fat: Drivers of Healthful Food Intake and the Impact of Diabetes Diagnosis,Journal of Marketing,2013,"This study examines how household members? personal characteristics and key marketing factors affect the healthfulness of food purchased for in-home consumption; it further considers how food intake changes following a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in the household. Using a combination of grocery purchases over four years, survey data about health status, and the nutrition content of 13 of the largest packaged food categories, this study shows that households with higher education and nutrition interest consume fewer calories, sugar, and total carbohydrates, whereas those with higher self-control consume more, because they offset their lower intake of ?unhealthy? categories (e.g., soft drinks) with higher intake of ?healthy? categories (e.g., cereal). The consumption of sugar and carbohydrates decreases significantly in response to a diabetes diagnosis, whereas the intake of fat and sodium increases. Education, nutrition interest, and self-control are not associated with healthier changes in response to a diagnosis, but younger and higher-income households, as well as those in which the diabetes patient is female, make healthier changes. These findings have notable implications for marketers, consumers, consumer researchers, and public health professionals.",0
Process and Outcome Interdependency in Frontline Service Encounters,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Although marketing researchers have emphasized the interactive nature of service encounters, there has been scant research regarding how dyadic behaviors in a service encounter are interrelated. The authors recognize two distinct forms of dyadic interdependency: process interdependency, in which each party's enactment of behavior influences the other's enactment of behavior, and outcome interdependency, in which the impact of each party's behavior on service outcome depends on the other party's behavior. Using the interpersonal circumplex model and its related concept of complementarity, the authors examine both forms of dyadic interdependency by directly observing provider?client interpersonal behaviors in a natural frontline service setting over an extended period. The findings on process interdependency indicate that dyadic behaviors elicit or inhibit each other largely in a complementary manner. The findings on outcome interdependency show that, in general, complementary interactions between the provider and client enhance the client's satisfaction, whereas anticomplementary interactions dampen the client's satisfaction.",0
Core versus Peripheral Innovations: The Effect of Innovation Locus on Consumer Adoption of New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In four experimental studies, the authors investigate the effect of innovation locus?whether the innovation is integrated with the base product (the core locus) or offered as a detachable accessory (the peripheral locus)?on consumers? adoption intentions. The findings show that offering a really new innovation (RNI) as a detachable peripheral component leads to higher adoption intentions than integrating the same innovation into the core. Innovation locus, however, does not have an effect on incrementally new innovations. The positive effect of peripheral locus (relative to core locus) for RNIs occurs through four mechanisms: (1) reduced schema incongruity, (2) lower risk perceptions, (3) increased benefit understanding, and (4) greater perceived usage flexibility associated with the new product. The authors demonstrate these effects by using stimuli from four product categories and including both attitudinal and behavioral measures of innovation adoption. The findings have implications for product design strategies for RNIs.",1
Consumer Adoption of New Products: Independent versus Interdependent Self-Perspectives,Journal of Marketing,2014,"In five studies, the authors examine the impact of an independent (vs. interdependent) mindset on consumer adoption of new products. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers in a predominantly independent (vs. interdependent) culture are more willing to adopt really new products, whereas consumers in a predominantly interdependent (vs. independent) culture are more willing to adopt incrementally new products. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicate these findings using situationally activated mindsets and demonstrate that this effect is driven by the perceived fit between the product's newness level and the optimal level of distinctiveness consumers want. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b show that the presence of distinctiveness-dampening cues (i.e., popularity cues) and distinctiveness-enhancing cues (i.e., scarcity cues) can reverse the effect of self-perspective such that the independent self becomes less willing to adopt really new products and more willing to adopt incrementally new products than does the interdependent self. These findings offer practical implications for managing innovation adoption in both domestic and international marketplaces.",0
How Business Customers Judge Solutions: Solution Quality and Value in Use,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Many manufacturers look to business solutions to provide growth; however, success is far from guaranteed, and it is unclear how such solutions can create superior perceived value. This article explores what constitutes value for customers from solutions over time?conceptualized as ?value in use??and how this arises from quality perceptions of the solution's components. The authors develop a framework for solution quality and value in use through 36 interviews combining repertory grid technique and means-end chains. The findings significantly extend the extant view of quality as a function of the supplier's products and services, and show that customers also assess the quality of their own resources and processes, as well as the quality of the joint resource integration process. The authors report that value in use corresponds not just to collective, organizational goals but also to individuals? goals, a finding that strongly contrasts with prior research. Four moderators of the quality?value relationship demonstrate customer heterogeneity across both firms and roles within what the authors term the ?usage center.? When shifting toward solutions, manufacturers require very different approaches to market research; account management; solution design; and quality control, including the need for value-auditing processes.",0
The Determinants of Pre- and Postpromotion Dips in Sales of Frequently Purchased Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors empirically study the relationships between pre- and post-promotion dips in weekly store data and Universal Product Code (UPC), category, and store trading-area customer characteristics. Drawing on recent advances in econometric modeling, they estimate 39,441 pre- and postpromotion dip elasticities in 83 stores in ten product categories. They relate these elasticities to 24 characteristics, such as UPC price and market share, category budget share and storability, and store trading-area demographics. The authors find that UPC, category, and store trading-area customer characteristics all explain significant variation in the elasticities. For example, both pre- and postpromotion dips are stronger for high-priced, frequently promoted, mature, high-market-share UPCs. They find that postpromotion dips are not significantly different for private labels but are more prominent for UPCs with less predictable promotion patterns. They also find that stores with trading areas that consist of older customers who live in larger households and own cars are particularly prone to postpromotion dips. The findings potentially deepen the understanding of stockpiling and deceleration and blend two trends in promotion response research: an increased focus on pre- and postpromotion effects and a greater emphasis on examination of cross-sectional differences in promotion response.",1
Collaborative Market Driving: How Peer Firms Can Develop Markets Through Collective Action,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Firms often aim to develop markets as part of their long-term strategies. Conventionally, research in marketing has explained this complex process by stressing firms? efforts to outdo their peers. While this emphasis is valuable, it overlooks the role of another major force in market evolution: collective action among peer firms. To address this oversight, this article conceptualizes ?collaborative market driving,? defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms consistently cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop markets in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This conceptualization includes the triggers that lead peer firms to mobilize for collective action and coalesce with other market actors; it also identifies how this coalition converts collective resources into market-driving power. These theoretical contributions, based on a multimethod analysis of the rise of U.S. craft breweries, offer an alternative course of action for firms interested in driving new markets when they lack adequate resources to do so individually.",0
A Framework for Conceptual Contributions in Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Conceptual advances are critical to the vitality of the marketing discipline, yet recent writings suggest that conceptual advancement in the field is slowing. The author addresses this issue by developing a framework for thinking about conceptualization in marketing. A definition of conceptualization is followed by a typology of types of conceptual contributions. The types of conceptual contributions, their similarities and differences, and their importance to the field are described. Thinking skills linked to various types of conceptual contributions are also described, as are the use of tools that can facilitate these skills. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for advancing conceptualization in our field in the years to come.",0
The Concept of Hope and its Relevance to Product Evaluation and Choice,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This conceptual article uses an appraisal theory perspective to define the construct of hope and describe its relevance to consumer behavior, marketing, and public policy in the domains of product evaluation and choice. Using the appraisal dimensions of hope, the authors identify a set of marketing tactics that are designed to stimulate hope. They posit that hope plays a moderating role in the relationship between well-known antecedent variables (e.g., involvement, expectations) on the one hand and evaluative judgments (e.g., attitudes, satisfaction) and consumer choices on the other hand. The authors advance specific propositions that describe the effects. Furthermore, they argue that the effects have implications for marketing and public policy. The article concludes with a call for additional research relevant to the study of hope.",0
"Creating Boundary-Breaking, Marketing-Relevant Consumer Research",Journal of Marketing,2019,"Consumer research often fails to have broad impact on members of the marketing discipline, on adjacent disciplines studying related phenomena, and on relevant stakeholders who stand to benefit from the knowledge created by rigorous research. The authors propose that impact is limited because consumer researchers have adhered to a set of implicit boundaries or defaults regarding what consumer researchers study, why they study it, and how they do so. The authors identify these boundaries and describe how they can be challenged. By detailing five impactful articles and identifying others, they show that boundary-breaking, marketing-relevant consumer research can influence relevant stakeholders including academics in marketing and allied disciplines as well as a wide range of marketplace actors (e.g., business practitioners, policy makers, the media, society). Drawing on these articles, the authors articulate what researchers can do to break boundaries and enhance the impact of their research. They also indicate why engaging in boundary-breaking work and enhancing the breadth of marketing?s influence is good for both individual researchers and the fields of consumer research and marketing.",0
Assessing When Increased Media Weight of Real-World Advertisements Helps Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"A prevailing view is that increased media weight for frequently purchased brands in mature product categories usually does not lead to increases in sales. However, the role of advertising executional cues and viewer responses on media weight-induced sales has not yet been examined. The authors find that whether weight helps or has no sales impact depends on the creative characteristics of the advertisements and the responses they evoke in viewers. Study 1 showed that real-world advertisements for frequently purchased brands in mature categories were likely to create greater media weight-induced sales when they used affectively based executional cues. Study 2 found that greater media weight was related to the sales impact of advertisements that evoked positive feelings and failed to evoke negative feelings in viewers. The authors develop hypotheses related to these results within the context of prior work on consumer persuasion (including the elaboration likelihood model), memory processes, and advertising wearout.",1
Impact of Culture on the Pursuit of Beauty: Evidence from Five Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Human beings have always coveted beautiful objects, but the desire to look good is reaching new heights worldwide. Although the pursuit of beauty appears universal, industry evidence suggests that it is particularly strong in Asia. This research examines the effect of culture on the pursuit of beauty. Three studies provide converging evidence that interdependent self-construal increases the likelihood of using appearance-enhancing products. Study 1 operationalizes culture through nationality and self-construal and shows that Easterners (more interdependent) are more likely to use appearance-enhancing products than Westerners (less interdependent). This use is driven by interdependents? tendency to conform to societal norms, which in turn leads to heightened self-discrepancy (Study 2). The use of appearance-enhancing tools helps minimize this discrepancy. Study 3 shows that strength of norms moderates the impact of interdependence on the use of appearance-enhancing tools. When norms are loosely defined and adherence is not strictly enforced, interdependents? appearance enhancement tendency is reduced. This research offers actionable insights into the pursuit of beauty, marketing of beauty brands, policy making, and consumer well-being.",0
Managing Images in Different Cultures: A Cross-National Study of Color Meanings and Preferences,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Color is an integral part of products, services, packaging, logos, and other collateral and can be an effective means of creating and sustaining brand and corporate images in customers? minds. Through an eight-country study, the authors explore consumers? preferences for different colors and color combinations. The results show cross-cultural patterns of both similarity and dissimilarity in color preferences and color meaning associations. When subjects are asked to match colors for a product logo, some color combinations suggest a consistency in meaning, whereas other combinations suggest colors whose meanings are complementary. The authors discuss implications for managing color to create and sustain brand and corporate images across international markets.",0
Global Product Quality and Corporate Social Responsibility Perceptions: A Cross-National Study of Halo Effects,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Attribute ratings often contain a holistic or global impression of the brand, commonly referred to as ?halo.? A halo response can occur when perceptions of a brand's performance on an attribute are influenced by performance perceptions on another attribute or by a global impression of the brand. Using cross-national survey data from consumers in Argentina, China, Spain, and the United States, the authors examine the extent to which a halo response introduces bias to product quality and corporate social responsibility perceptions of competing brands. The findings show that halo is more pervasive for product quality than for corporate social responsibility associations, varies across brands and markets, and is strongly related to brand recommendations. Examining cross-national brand performance and halo perceptions can help international marketing managers understand key perceptual similarities and differences between and across markets, which can inform strategic considerations such as whether to pursue global, panregional, or national branding, positioning, and advertising strategies.",0
Executive Insights: Managerial Judgment of Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"The concept of export performance is very important for managers because they have to evaluate each individual export venture in order to make decisions about future international commitments. This article discusses export performance as it is expressed through the perceptions and goals of export managers. Managers appear to be oriented toward short-term sales when they assess the performance of a particular export venture. Furthermore, they often use a benchmarking approach, comparing the results of a particular export venture with results of other export markets or the domestic market. Consequences of such practices are explored, and alternative managerial judgment criteria are discussed.",0
The Cool Scent of Power: Effects of Ambient Scent on Consumer Preferences and Choice Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2015,"The present research examines how ambient scents affect consumers' spatial perceptions in retail environments, which in turn influence customers' feelings of power and, thus, product preference and purchasing behavior. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that in a warm- (vs. cool-) scented and thus perceptually more (vs. less) socially dense environment, people experience a greater (vs. lesser) need for power, which manifests in increased preference for and purchase of premium products and brands. This research extends knowledge on store atmospherics and customer experience management through the effects of ambient scent on spatial perceptions and builds on recent research on power in choice contexts.",0
Conservative When Crowded: Social Crowding and Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Does the mere crowdedness of the environment affect people's choices and preferences? In six studies, the authors show that social crowdedness not only leads to greater accessibility of safety-related constructs but also results in greater preference for safety-oriented options (e.g., preferring to visit a pharmacy to a convenience store), being more receptive to prevention- (rather than promotion-) framed messages, and being more risk averse with real money gambles. In support of the authors? underlying avoidance motivation perspective, these effects are mediated by participants? net prevention focus and are attenuated when the crowd in question consists of in-group members. The authors close by discussing the practical and theoretical implications of the results.",1
The Joint and Multilevel Effects of Training and Incentives from Upstream Manufacturers on Downstream Salespeople?s Efforts,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Manufacturers frequently face the challenge of motivating distributor salespeople to focus efforts on their products rather than competitors? products. The present research explores two mechanisms that manufacturers use to address this challenge: training and incentives (spiffs). The authors find that the impact of these mechanisms on distributor salespeople?s efforts (toward a manufacturer?s products) largely depends on the extent to which manufacturers also provide training and incentives to distributor sales managers. More specifically, providing greater incentives to distributor sales managers undermines the relationship between their salespeople?s training and effort but enhances the relationship between their salespeople?s incentives and effort. Furthermore, greater sales manager training enhances the impact of salespeople?s incentives on effort; however, greater salesperson training undermines the relationship between salesperson incentives and effort. Thus, this research shows that the combination of mechanisms (training and incentives) and the levels at which manufacturers provide them (distributor salespeople and sales managers) can have different implications for distributor salespeople?s efforts.",1
The Spillover Effects of Prototype Brand Transgressions on Country Image and Related Brands,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Country-of-origin research has primarily held the view that country-level beliefs influence product-level beliefs. In this study, the authors investigate whether the relationship may also move in the opposite direction. Grounded in prototype theory and schema change theory, this study examines shifts in consumer attitudes toward a country as a result of a brand transgression. The authors confirm the conceptual framework using experimental methods. The results offer evidence of a relationship in which product-level beliefs affect country-level beliefs, a finding that contrasts with the majority of country-of-origin research. The effects of brand transgressions are moderated by the degree of prototypicality of the transgressing brand and the level of development of the transgressing brand's home country.",0
Order-of-Entry Effects for Service Firms in Developing Markets: An Examination of Multinational Advertising Agencies,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"The internationalization process of service firms has received increased attention in recent years. Yet the question whether entry order affects firm performance for service firms in developing markets has remained unanswered. Despite lacking empirical evidence, prior research has suggested that first-mover advantages (FMAs) do not translate to service firms and developing markets. However, framed in a resource-advantage theory perspective, the authors? empirical analysis of 379 multinational subsidiaries of advertising agencies in 43 developing markets indicates a significant relationship between entry order and firm performance. The authors also examine the moderating effects of international experience, firm size, subsidiary ownership structure, and rate of economic development to assess how late entrants can mitigate late-mover disadvantages. The authors provide empirical evidence that, contrary to recent literature, service firms do enjoy FMAs. They add to the understanding of the FMA phenomenon as well as to the broader issue of the internationalization process and performance effects for service firms.",0
The Role of Cultural Intelligence in Marketing Adaptation and Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"This study examines how export manager cultural intelligence (CQ) affects the relationship between marketing-mix adaptation and export performance. From a resource-advantage theory perspective, the authors posit that export managers? motivational and metacognitive CQ are intangible but valuable resources that influence marketing strategy and export performance. According to survey data from 153 U.S. exporting firms, export managers? metacognitive CQ positively moderates the relationship between marketing-mix adaptations and export performance. Furthermore, export managers? motivational CQ positively moderates the relationship between environmental differences and marketing-mix adaptations. The study adds to the theoretical understanding of the adaptation?performance relationship and provides valuable guidelines for exporting firms in the recruitment, training, and promotion of export managers.",0
An Exploratory Investigation into Impulse Buying Behavior in a Transitional Economy: A Study of Urban Consumers in Vietnam,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"As a transitional economy, Vietnam is open to many new marketing experiences. Along with slowly increasing wealth, changes are occurring in the retail environment as stores begin to replace individual vendors. The changing retail environment suggests the usefulness of understanding shopping behaviors relevant to retail settings. The authors examine impulse buying behaviors of urban consumers in Vietnam. The authors conducted an exploratory study that included both qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a general understanding of urban Vietnamese consumers? impulse buying behaviors. Results show that individualism, age, and income are significantly related to impulse buying behaviors of Vietnamese consumers. In addition, personal-use products are the most common impulse purchase items, despite the collectivist nature of consumers in Vietnam. The authors? findings suggest that, at least with respect to impulse buying and despite cultural differences, consumers from transitional economies such as Vietnam may share some common tendencies and behaviors with consumers in advanced economies. The authors discuss other observations and conclude with suggestions for further research.",0
On the Other Hand?: Enhancing Promotional Effectiveness with Haptic Cues,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"People like graspable objects more when the objects are located on the dominant-hand side of their body or when the handles point toward their dominant-hand side. However, many products do not have handles or are not graspable (e.g., services, objects hanging on the wall). Can nongraspable products nevertheless benefit from the effects of appealing to viewers? dominant hands? The present research shows that, yes, consumers respond more positively to nongraspable products if a haptic cue (an object that is graspable or suggestive of hand action) is located within the same visual field as the target and is positioned to appeal to the viewer?s dominant hand. This result is driven by the creation and transfer of perceived ownership from cue to target. These findings extend the use of haptic cues to nongraspable products and uncover the critical role played by perceived ownership, including its ability to transfer from one object to another located in the same visual field. Moreover, the current research demonstrates situations in which the use of haptic cues will not enhance response.",1
Multiple Routes to Self- versus Other-Expression in Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Studies of consumer decision making often begin with the identification of a dimension on which options differ, followed by an analysis of the factors that influence preferences along that dimension. Building on a conceptual analysis of a diverse set of problems, the authors identify a class of related consumers choices (e.g., extreme vs. compromise, hedonic vs. utilitarian, risky vs. safe) that can all be classified according to their levels of self- versus other-expression (or [un]conventionality). As shown in four studies, these problem types respond similarly to manipulations that trigger or suppress self-expression. Specifically, priming self-expression systematically increases the share of the self-expressive options across choice problems. Conversely, expecting to be evaluated decreases the share of the self-expressive options across the various choice dilemmas. In addition, priming risk seeking increases only the choice of risky gambles but not of other self-expressive options. These findings highlight the importance of seeking underlying shared features across different consumer choice problems, instead of treating each type in isolation.",1
"Circles, Squares, and Choice: The Effect of Shape Arrays on Uniqueness and Variety Seeking",Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Five experiments demonstrate that exposure to novel visual stimulus arrays of geometric shapes affects consumers? real choices among products. The authors first demonstrate that exposure to variety arrays (arrays of differing shapes) increases variety seeking (Study 1). They then show that exposure to uniqueness arrays (e.g., one circle among six squares) increases choice of unique over common objects (Studies 2 and 3) and interacts with chronic need for uniqueness (Study 3). In the final two studies, the authors show that variety and uniqueness arrays activate distinct constructs; specifically, they find no effect of exposure to uniqueness arrays on variety seeking (Study 4a) and no effect of exposure to variety arrays on uniqueness seeking (Study 4b). Taken together, these studies build on the existing literature about nonconscious effects on consumer behavior and choice behavior in particular by showing that consumers? real choices are affected by subtle exposure to novel stimuli that do not have any previous associations.",1
Emotional Brand Attachment and Brand Personality: The Relative Importance of the Actual and the Ideal Self,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Creating emotional brand attachment is a key branding issue in today's marketing world. One way to accomplish this is to match the brand's personality with the consumer's self. A key question, however, is whether the brand's personality should match the consumer's actual self or the consumer's ideal self. On the basis of two empirical studies of 167 brands (evaluated by 1329 and 980 consumers), the authors show that the implications of self-congruence for consumers? emotional brand attachment are complex and differ by consumers? product involvement, consumers? individual difference variables, and the type of self-congruence (fit of the brand's personality with the consumer's actual self versus with the consumer's ideal self). On a general level, actual self-congruence has the greatest impact on emotional brand attachment. Product involvement, self-esteem, and public self-consciousness increase the positive impact of actual self-congruence but decrease the impact of ideal self-congruence on emotional brand attachment. The authors discuss important managerial and academic implications of these findings.",0
Internationalization and Entry Modes: A Multitheoretical Framework and Research Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Although several aspects of the internationalization process have been addressed in the literature, there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework that explains the internationalization process, entry modes, and timing strategies. This article synthesizes several foundational theories on modes of global entry and offers a conceptual framework of the internationalization process. Throughout the article, the authors identify several propositions based on the proposed theoretical framework.",0
Deferring versus Expediting Consumption: The Effect of Outcome Concreteness on Sensitivity to Time Horizon,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This work examines consumers' preferences for consumption timing. Specifically, the authors examine how temporal framing (deferring versus expediting) of a decision moderates the sensitivity of consumers' pattern of discounting to changes in time horizon. The results from three experiments show greater decline in consumers' discount rates with time horizon (i.e., greater present bias) when they defer than when they expedite consumption. These results are robust to using monetary and nonmonetary outcomes, as well as to different time horizons (months, days). The authors further demonstrate that the different levels of mental representations (concreteness) triggered by the two decision frames moderate this difference in sensitivity.",1
Exploring the Effects of ?What? (Product) and ?Where? (Website) Characteristics on Online Shopping Behavior,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Understanding factors that influence online shopping and managing consumer relationships is not a trivial task for firms, considering the many pertinent factors that influence behavior, including the product being shopped (i.e., the ?what?) and the context of the website itself (i.e., the ?where?). This study investigates the impact of these characteristics on an online transaction's basket value, after incorporating the role of other aspects of the browsing process including page views and visit duration. The authors estimate a multivariate mixed-effects Type II Tobit model with a system of equations to explain variation in shopping basket value, using data involving 773,262 browsing sessions resulting in 9,664 transactions across 43 product categories from 385 unique websites. The results support the assertions that contextual factors are associated with online browsing. For example, a website's scope in terms of product variety is associated positively with visit durations and basket values but negatively with page views. Furthermore, a website's communication functionality is positively associated with basket value for hedonic products. Insights suggest managerial implications involving product and website strategies for online retailers.",0
From Finance to Marketing: The Impact of Financial Leverage on Customer Satisfaction,Journal of Marketing,2015,"The authors examine how a firm's financial leverage affects marketing outcomes and consequent firm value. They find that leverage has a dual effect: it reduces customer satisfaction and moderates the relationship between satisfaction and firm value. The burden of making regular interest payments to debt holders pressures managers to generate adequate cash flows. The authors theorize that this may lead marketers to adopt short-term actions such as cutting advertising and research-and-development spending, which can hurt customer satisfaction by lowering perceived quality and perceived value. Furthermore, higher leverage reduces financial flexibility by constraining marketers from exploiting growth opportunities resulting from higher customer satisfaction. The authors empirically show that leverage leads to lower customer satisfaction, with advertising intensity mediating this effect. The negative impact of leverage on satisfaction is more pronounced for service firms and firms in competitive markets. Finally, leverage negatively moderates the customer satisfaction?firm value link. Increases in customer satisfaction are value enhancing at modest levels of leverage, but at very high levels of leverage, increases in satisfaction are value reducing.",0
"How Main Street Drives Wall Street: Customer (Dis)satisfaction, Short Sellers, and Abnormal Returns",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Although previous studies have established a direct link between customer-based metrics and stock returns, research is unclear on the mediated nature of their association. The authors examine the association of customer satisfaction and abnormal stock returns, as mediated by the trading behavior of short sellers. Using quarterly data from 273 firms over 2007?2017, the authors find that short interest?a measure of short seller activity?mediates the impact of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction on abnormal stock returns. Customer dissatisfaction has a more pronounced effect on short selling compared with customer satisfaction. In addition, customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction are more relevant for firms with low capital intensity and firms that face lower competitive intensity. The results show that a one-unit increase in customer satisfaction is associated with a .56 percentage point increase in abnormal returns, while a one-unit increase in customer dissatisfaction is associated with a 1.34 percentage point decrease in abnormal returns.",1
Price-Matching Guarantees as a Direct Signal of Low Prices,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"If consumers believe that stores offering price-matching guarantees (PMGs) charge low prices, high-search-cost consumers will purchase from PMG stores. This leads PMG stores? demand to be less price sensitive, which drives these stores to charge higher prices. The belief that PMG stores charge low prices paradoxically leads them to charge high prices. For this reason, the literature finds that PMGs can only signal low prices when firm heterogeneity is sufficiently large. Because PMGs are offered by retailers that purchase the same product from the same producer, large firm heterogeneity may be a strong assumption. This article proposes a theory that explains how homogeneous firms may signal their low prices through PMGs: consumers perceive PMG stores to have lower prices not because they expect them to have low marginal costs or service quality, but simply because they offer a PMG.",1
The Effect of Banner Advertising on Internet Purchasing,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This article focuses on whether banner advertising affects purchasing patterns on the Internet. Using a behavioral database that consists of customer purchases at a Web site along with individual advertising exposure, the authors measure the impact of banner advertising on current customers' probabilities of repurchase, while accounting for duration dependence. The authors model the probability of a current customer making a purchase in any given week (since the last purchase) with a survival model that uses a flexible, piecewise exponential hazard function. The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables and advertising/individual browsing variables. The model is cast in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which enables the authors to obtain individual advertising response parameters. The results show that the number of exposures, number of Web sites, and number of pages all have a positive effect on repeat purchase probabilities, whereas the number of unique creatives has a negative effect. Returns from targeting are the highest for the number of advertising exposures. The findings also add to the general advertising literature by showing that advertising affects the purchase behavior of current (versus new) customers.",1
Response Modeling with Nonrandom Marketing-Mix Variables,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Sales response models are widely used as the basis for optimizing the marketing mix. Response models condition on the observed marketing-mix variables and focus on the specification of the distribution of observed sales given marketing-mix activities. The models usually fail to recognize that the levels of the marketing-mix variables are often chosen with at least partial knowledge of the response parameters in the conditional model. This means that contrary to standard assumptions, the marginal distribution of the marketing-mix variables is not independent of response parameters. The authors expand on the standard conditional model to include a model for the determination of the marketing-mix variables. They apply this modeling approach to the problem of gauging the effectiveness of sales calls (details) to induce greater prescribing of drugs by individual physicians. They do not assume a priori that details are set optimally, but instead they infer the extent to which sales force managers have knowledge of responsiveness, and they use this knowledge to set the level of sales force contact. The authors find that their modeling approach improves the precision of the physician-specific response parameters significantly. They also find that physicians are not detailed optimally; high-volume physicians are detailed to a greater extent than low-volume physicians without regard to responsiveness to detailing. It appears that unresponsive but high-volume physicians are detailed the most. Finally, the authors illustrate how their approach provides a general framework.",1
Uphill or Downhill? Locating the Firm on a Profit Function,Journal of Marketing,2007,"When deciding about changes in levels of multiple marketing investments aimed at improving profits, managers need to know whether they are on the uphill side or the downhill side of the profit function with respect to each investment variable. Spending errors made by an uphill-located firm that believes that it is a downhill-located firm can have serious consequences. This article offers an econometric ?diagnostic tool? to infer a company's current location on a multivariable profit function and to determine the changes in investments that will take the company to the neighborhood of the maximum profit. The authors apply the proposed approach to daily newspaper industry data and investigate the optimality of companies' allocation behaviors with respect to three marketing efforts: investments in quality, distribution, and advertising space sales effort. A novel feature of this problem setting is that it involves a ?dual-revenue? market with possibly interrelated demands for subscriptions and advertising space. The authors derive normative rules for marketing investments in four dual-revenue market types. The empirical analysis finds that daily newspapers' dual revenues are positively interrelated and that a majority of these companies are located near the optimal level of spending for quality, a surprising finding considering that previous studies have characterized marketing managers as overspenders. Indeed, when these companies are suboptimal, they are much more likely to be underspending (i.e., they are located on the uphill side of the profit function) than overspending. In addition, the research furnishes estimates of sales elasticities with respect to quality, personal selling, and distribution investments, which are sparsely available in the extant literature.",0
Optimal Pricing Strategies for an Automotive Aftermarket Retailer,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The extant retail category pricing optimization literature concentrates on grocery retailing. In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related ?hard-part? product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically ?Good,? ?Better,? ?Best?); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter to previous grocery retailing-based findings.",1
Actualizing Innovation Effort: The Impact of Market Knowledge Diffusion in a Dynamic System of Competition,Journal of Marketing,2004,"This study focuses on the dynamic process that governs the impact of market knowledge diffusion on innovation effort and its subsequent effect on firm performance. First, the author proposes that three aspects of market knowledge (knowledge level, knowledge change, and extent of shared knowledge about customers and competitors) influence innovation effort. In so doing, she explicitly models the dynamic process of competition, including heterogeneity in interdependence of innovation across competitors, firm-specific inertial tendency in innovation, and feedback effects reflected in satisfaction with past performance. Second, within a partial adjustment model of performance, the author studies the role of shared market knowledge and firm size in the translation of innovation effort into firm performance over time. She tests the conceptual framework with longitudinal quasi field experiments based on a Markstrat simulation exercise, including a main experiment and three validation studies. The results reveal a dynamic system in which some aspects of market knowledge diffusion propel innovation, whereas satisfaction with past performance hinders innovation effort. Furthermore, the results show that innovation effort, by itself, does not affect firm performance. In the context of the study, total shared market knowledge helps smaller firms actualize better returns from their innovation effort than larger firms.",0
Frontline Problem-Solving Effectiveness: A Dynamic Analysis of Verbal and Nonverbal Cues,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"This study examines the impact of frontline employees' problem solving on customer satisfaction (CSAT) during ongoing interactions prompted by service failures and complaints. Using outsourced regulation theory, the authors predict negative moderating effects of frontline relational work and displayed affect on the dynamic influence of frontline solving work on CSAT. Frontline employees' verbal (nonverbal) cues provide the basis to identify solving and relational work (displayed affect). The authors test hypotheses with data from video recordings of real-life problem-solving interactions involving airline customers as well as a controlled experimental study. They find that frontline solving work has a positive effect on CSAT, and it increases in magnitude as the interaction unfolds. However, this positive effect becomes weaker for relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time. In summary, overdoing relational work and overdisplaying positive affect diminish the efficacy of problem-solving interactions, a finding that provides implications for theory and practice.",1
"Do Frontline Mechanisms Matter? Impact of Quality and Productivity Orientations on Unit Revenue, Efficiency, and Customer Satisfaction",Journal of Marketing,2008,"This study identifies a frontline mechanism comprising autonomy, cohesion, and feedback that helps explain when and why the simultaneous pursuit of quality and productivity orientations has positive or negative effects on unit revenue, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. An empirical test of the proposed framework using data from 423 employees in 30 strategic business units and longitudinal unit-level performance data indicates that frontline autonomy mediates the positive impact of productivity and quality orientations on unit revenue and customer satisfaction and their negative impact on unit efficiency. Feedback amplifies the influence of frontline autonomy by simultaneously enhancing its positive effect on satisfaction and its negative effect on efficiency. In contrast, unit cohesion strengthens the positive effect of frontline autonomy on revenue and customer satisfaction without augmenting its negative effect on unit efficiency. The results urge managers to shift their focus toward unit-level mechanisms to find clues for managing strategic dilemmas that stem from multiple goal pursuit in face-to-face service settings.",0
"The Differential Impact of Goal Congruency on Attitudes, Intentions, and the Transfer of Brand Equity",Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Various theories suggest that the perceived similarity of objects facilitates the transfer of knowledge, affect, and intentions from one object to the other. However, there is disagreement as to the meaning of similarity and how it should be operationalized among these various theories, and no effort to relate these various measures to one another exists in the literature. In an empirical study, the authors examine the relationships among measures of product similarity in three different contexts: (1) goal-congruent products, (2) moderately goal-incongruent products, and (3) extremely goal-incongruent products. The results of exploratory factor analyses revealed that perceived similarity is a multidimensional construct and that the number and structure of these dimensions of similarity are different when products differ in their degrees of goal congruency. Structural equation analyses of the measures based on a second sample confirmed the structure obtained in the earlier exploratory analyses and demonstrated that brand attitudes and purchase intention exhibit different relationships to the underlying dimensions of similarity in the goal-congruent and goal-incongruent conditions, consistent with expectations based on the theory of goal-derived categorization. The authors discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice.",1
Data Privacy: Effects on Customer and Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Although marketers increasingly rely on customer data, firms have little insight into the ramifications of such data use and do not know how to prevent negative effects. Data management efforts may heighten customers? vulnerability worries or create real vulnerability. Using a conceptual framework grounded in gossip theory, the authors link customer vulnerability to negative performance effects. Three studies show that transparency and control in firms? data management practices can suppress the negative effects of customer data vulnerability. Experimental manipulations reveal that mere access to personal data inflates feelings of violation and reduces trust. An event study of data security breaches affecting 414 public companies also confirms negative effects, as well as spillover vulnerabilities from rival firms? breaches, on firm performance. Severity of the breach hurts the focal firm but helps the rival firm, which provides some insight into mixed findings in prior research. Finally, a field study with actual customers of 15 companies across three industries demonstrates consistent effects across four types of customer data vulnerability and confirms that violation and trust mediate the effects of data vulnerabilities on outcomes.",0
"Political Management, Research and Development, and Advertising Capital in the Pharmaceutical Industry: A Good Prognosis?",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Regulatory oversight that affects the firm's product-market environment continues to increase. Political management capital (PMC) describes firm expenditure committed to address the political and regulatory context. Neoinstitutional theory casts PMC as an institutionally expected normative response investors use when evaluating firm performance. Although limited evidence has suggested that firms benefit from PMC, the authors demonstrate its effects across financial outcomes including firm value, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Likewise, they examine how PMC interacts with a firm's product market through research-and-development (R&D) capital and advertising capital. Regression analysis of an unbalanced data set of 212 firms in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, tracked from 2003 to 2014, reveals that while PMC improves investor expectations through firm value and systematic risk, it increases idiosyncratic risk. The authors find that PMC plays both substitutive and complementary roles with R&D such that increasing levels of both PMC and R&D weakens main effects. Political management capital has limited, but substitutive, effects with advertising likely because there is less regulatory oversight on advertising versus R&D in this industry. The authors explore these asymmetric effects, provide implications for neoinstitutional theory, and offer managerial insights.",0
The Effects of Strategy Type on the Market Orientation?Performance Relationship,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Prior research has been equivocal on the role that competitive environment plays in moderating the relationship between market orientation and a firm's business performance, even though such a moderating effect is conceptually quite plausible (Slater and Narver 1994). In this article, the authors empirically examine the role of business strategy type as an alternative, potential moderator of the market orientation?performance relationship. By using an improved version of Kohli and Jaworski's market orientation scale (Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Kohli, Jaworski, and Kumar 1993), the authors find evidence that supports the moderating effects of business strategy type on the strength of the relationship between market orientation and business performance. The authors also offer implications and future research questions based on the findings.",0
The Effects of Entrepreneurial Proclivity and Market Orientation on Business Performance,Journal of Marketing,2002,"The recent literature suggests a potential tension between market orientation and entrepreneurial proclivity in achieving superior business performance. This is unsettling for marketers, because it could mean that being market oriented is detrimental to a firm that is also trying to be entrepreneurial and successful. To examine this unnerving potential, the authors investigate structural influences (both direct and indirect) of entrepreneurial proclivity and market orientation on business performance. The results indicate that entrepreneurial proclivity has not only a positive and direct relationship on market orientation but also an indirect and positive effect on market orientation through the reduction of departmentalization. The results also suggest that entrepreneurial proclivity's performance influence is positive when mediated by market orientation but negative or nonsignificant when not mediated by market orientation. The authors also provide a discussion and future research implications.",0
Firms Reap what they Sow: The Effects of Shared Values and Perceived Organizational Justice on Customers? Evaluations of Complaint Handling,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Employing elements of organizational theory and service recovery research, the authors examine how employees? perceptions of shared values and organizational justice can stimulate customer-directed extra-role behaviors when handling complaints. They also investigate how these extra-role behaviors affect customers? perceptions of justice, satisfaction, word of mouth, and purchase intent. The authors capture and match employee and customer perceptions regarding the relevant constructs following a complaint and recovery experience. The results indicate that employees? perceptions of shared values and organizational justice affect customer-directed extra-role behaviors. Furthermore, the authors find that extra-role behaviors have significant effects on customers? perceptions of justice and that these behaviors mediate the effects of shared values and organizational justice on customer justice perceptions. Their study reveals that customer ratings of justice affect the customer outcomes of satisfaction with recovery, overall firm satisfaction, purchase intent, and word of mouth. Finally, the authors show that customers? perceptions of justice mediate the effects that extra-role behaviors have on customer outcomes.",0
International Market Entry: Does the Home Country Affect Entry-Mode Decisions?,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"The author reviews 26 empirical studies that evaluate home-country effects on the choice of market entry mode. The analysis of available findings shows that the nationality of companies is likely to affect entry-mode strategies. However, the effect varies according to the assessment of the national environment of companies, which suggests that some cultural and economic dimensions are more relevant for this field of research than others.",0
The Dishonesty of Honest People: A Theory of Self-Concept Maintenance,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"People like to think of themselves as honest. However, dishonesty pays?and it often pays well. How do people resolve this tension? This research shows that people behave dishonestly enough to profit but honestly enough to delude themselves of their own integrity. A little bit of dishonesty gives a taste of profit without spoiling a positive self-view. Two mechanisms allow for such self-concept maintenance: inattention to moral standards and categorization malleability. Six experiments support the authors? theory of self-concept maintenance and offer practical applications for curbing dishonesty in everyday life.",1
The Long Reach of Sponsorship: How Fan Isolation and Identification Jointly Shape Sponsorship Performance,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Globalization and technology have expanded the reach of sports teams, giving brand sponsors new opportunities to engage and build relationships in real time with fans outside a team?s home market. This research investigates the role of fan isolation, or the experience of feeling separated from the team community, in shaping sponsorship effectiveness. The authors posit that such isolation increases the desire to affiliate with the team community, which can increase preferences for team-linked brands. However, the effect of isolation on sponsor performance depends on the strength of fan identification. Isolation increases strong fans? desire to affiliate with the team community, thereby enhancing sponsorship performance; by contrast, isolation causes weak fans to avoid team-linked brands. Two field studies and four quasi experiments conducted across three countries (N = 1,412) confirm these predictions. Isolated strong fans exhibit increased recall, attitudes, purchase intentions, and word of mouth for sponsors, while isolated weak fans display the opposite effects. For brand managers, the proposed framework reveals whether isolated fans provide the best or worst returns on their sponsorships.",0
An Investigation of Reference Price Segments,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Empirical research on reference price has typically assumed that consumers use either an internal reference price (IRP) or an external reference price (ERP), but not both, in brand choice decisions. In this article, the authors assume that consumers use both IRP and ERP but may consider one of them more salient than the other. The authors develop a model that segments consumers on the basis of the differences in the importance they assign to each type of reference price as well as in their brand preferences and responses to marketing-mix variables. The authors calibrate the model on data for four categories: liquid detergents, ketchup, tissue, and yogurt. In all four categories, the proposed model performs significantly better than the one that assumes that consumers use either IRP or ERP exclusively. The authors discuss the managerial implications of this finding.",1
Reference Price Research: Review and Propositions,Journal of Marketing,2005,"A substantial body of research evidence has now accumulated in the reference price literature. One stream of research has identified the antecedents of reference price and has assessed their effects through experimentation. Others have calibrated a variety of reference price models on panel data and reported the effects on brand choice and other purchase decisions. In this article, the authors review the published literature on reference price in both the behavioral and modeling streams. They offer an integrative framework to review prior research on (1) the formation of reference price, (2) retrieval and use of reference price, and (3) influences of reference price on various purchase decisions and evaluations. In doing so, the authors examine the influences of consumers' prior purchase history and contextual moderators, such as specific purchase occasions, promotional environment of the store, and product category characteristics. They summarize the key findings, identify the unresolved issues, and offer an agenda for further research, which includes a set of testable propositions. They also identify the methodological challenges that face reference price research. In the concluding section, the authors discuss the managerial implications of reference price research.",0
Building Brand Community,Journal of Marketing,2002,"A brand community from a customer-experiential perspective is a fabric of relationships in which the customer is situated. Crucial relationships include those between the customer and the brand, between the customer and the firm, between the customer and the product in use, and among fellow customers. The authors delve ethnographically into a brand community and test key findings through quantitative methods. Conceptually, the study reveals insights that differ from prior research in four important ways: First, it expands the definition of a brand community to entities and relationships neglected by previous research. Second, it treats vital characteristics of brand communities, such as geotemporal concentrations and the richness of social context, as dynamic rather than static phenomena. Third, it demonstrates that marketers can strengthen brand communities by facilitating shared customer experiences in ways that alter those dynamic characteristics. Fourth, it yields a new and richer conceptualization of customer loyalty as integration in a brand community.",0
Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Effect of Firm Strategy,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Advertising's influence on firm sales and firm value has drawn early attention from economists and accountants and more recent attention from marketers. Most studies that have investigated a link between advertising and sales have found such a link. However, studies that have investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value. In this article, the authors hypothesize that advertising influences firm value for a differentiator because advertising can elaborate the firm's point of difference into brand equity, thereby building firm value. Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms? reactions to a change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses: advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders. Beyond explaining differences in advertising effectiveness, this study's indicator of differentiation versus cost leadership should enhance future analyses of marketing's effect on firm-level outcomes using archival financial data.",1
"Advertising, Research and Development, and Systematic Risk of the Firm",Journal of Marketing,2007,"Marketing executives are being urged to speak in the language of finance to gain internal support for marketing initiatives. Responding to this call, the authors examine the impact of a firm's advertising and its research and development (R&D) on the systematic risk of its stock, a key metric for publicly listed firms. They hypothesize that a firm's advertising and R&D expenditures create intangible assets that insulate it from stock market changes, lowering its systematic risk. They test the hypotheses using a panel data on 644 publicly listed firms between 1979 and 2001, consisting of five-year moving windows. They scale the firm's advertising and R&D expenditures by its sales. After controlling for factors that accounting and finance researchers have shown to be associated with systematic risk, the authors find that advertising/sales and R&D/sales lower a firm's systematic risk. The article's findings extend prior research that has focused primarily on the effect of marketing initiatives on performance metrics without consideration of systematic risk. For practice, the ability of advertising and R&D to reduce systematic risk highlights the multifaceted implications of advertising and research programs. The article's findings may surprise senior management, some of whom are skeptical of the financial accountability of advertising programs.",0
Entrepreneurial Instant Exporters in the Scottish Arts and Crafts Sector,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This article deals with a study of the international behavior of Scottish arts and crafts businesses that are ?instant internationals.? The internationalization process is analyzed together with the key influences on rapid internationalization. In what might be regarded as a rather sleepy sector of the economy, it is interesting to find microbusinesses that have gone international in their first year of business. Portraits of three companies are presented to illustrate the internationalization process, the importance of networks, and how, sometimes, the process can be unplanned. The key influences as to why they are instant internationals are classified as (1) product related, (2) personal and psychological, (3) industry related, and (4) cognitive. The analysis identifies the distinguishing features of these firms in relation to their internationalization activities, namely, that the entrepreneurs view themselves as businesspeople rather than craftspeople.",0
Customer-Based Corporate Valuation for Publicly Traded Noncontractual Firms,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"There is growing interest in ?customer-based corporate valuation??that is, explicitly tying the value of a firm?s customer base to its overall financial valuation using publicly disclosed data. While much progress has been made in building a well-validated customer-based valuation model for contractual (or subscription-based) firms, there has been little progress for noncontractual firms. Noncontractual businesses have more complex transactional patterns because customer churn is not observed, and customer purchase timing and spend amounts are more irregular. Furthermore, publicly disclosed data are aggregated over time and across customers, are often censored, and may vary from firm to firm, making it harder to estimate models for customer acquisition, ordering, and spend per order. The authors develop a general customer-based valuation methodology for noncontractual firms that accounts for these issues. They apply this methodology to publicly disclosed data from e-commerce retailers Overstock.com and Wayfair, provide valuation point estimates and valuation intervals for the firms, and compare the unit economics of newly acquired customers.",1
Valuing Subscription-Based Businesses Using Publicly Disclosed Customer Data,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The growth of subscription-based commerce has changed the types of data that firms report to external shareholders. More than ever, companies are discussing and disclosing information on the number of customers acquired and lost, customer lifetime value, and other data. This has fueled an increasing interest in linking the value of a firm's customers to the overall value of the firm, with the term ?customer-based corporate valuation? being used to describe such efforts. Although several researchers in the fields of marketing and accounting have explored this idea, their underlying models of customer acquisition and retention do not adequately reflect the empirical realities associated with these behaviors, and the associated valuation models do not meet the standards of finance professionals. The authors develop a framework for valuing subscription-based firms that addresses both issues, and they apply it to data from DISH Network and Sirius XM Holdings.",0
Supply Chain Contagion,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Drawing on research from the interfirm relationship, marketing channels, operations management, and network theory literature and on the basis of qualitative depth interviews, the authors identify a new phenomenon they call ?supply chain contagion.? Supply chain contagion is the propagation of interfirm behaviors from one dyadic relationship to an adjacent dyadic relationship within the supply chain. Contagion can occur inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties. Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur. Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked manufacturer?dealer?customer supply chain triads and explain a large variance (R2 = .30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to influence strategically the behavior of channel partners and may be better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other organizations within their supply chain.",0
Influence Tactics for Effective Adaptive Selling,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The adaptive selling literature identifies effective salespeople as those who match their influence tactics to suit the characteristics of buyers. However, prior research is largely silent on the specific influence tactics that salespeople use and the effectiveness of these tactics across different types of buyers. The authors propose a theoretical model that uses Kelman's (1961) underlying influence processes of internalization, compliance, and identification to identify the seller influence tactics that salespeople use and to assess which of these tactics will resonate with three types of buyers: task-oriented buyers, interaction-oriented buyers, and self-oriented buyers. The authors test their model with data from 193 bidirectionally matched buyer?seller dyads. The results strongly support the theoretical model and suggest that buyers are more complex than originally presumed. However, salespeople seem to recognize this complexity and use the combination of influence tactics prescribed by theory for persuading these types of buyers.",0
Dimensions of Price as a Marketing Universal: A Comparison of Japanese and U.S. Consumers,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Consumer behaviors within a segment and regarding a product category that do not vary across cultures are defined as market universale (Dawar and Parker 1994). Japanese and U.S. students (N = 267) participated in this study of price cues. The psychometric properties of three different price scales?price/quality schema, prestige sensitivity, and value consciousness?are assessed, and equality constraints are introduced to compare the measurement models from the two groups. Results suggest that the scales are reliable measures across the two countries and that market-universal behaviors may exist for a similar segment of Japanese and U.S. consumers.",0
Internationalization of Franchise Systems,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"Though the internationalization of firms has progressed in theory development and empirical testing during the last two decades, researchers continue to concentrate on the exporting behavior of manufacturers to the exclusion of other forms of international involvement. This exploratory study provides a partial test of the internationalization hypothesis in a franchise setting and identifies two segments of franchisors, which differ in several ways. Franchise systems in the final stage of internationalization have larger international operations, generate a larger percent of sales from international operations, and have more diversified expansion plans. In addition, systems in the two stages differ in ownership structure. The findings add insights into the internationalization process of franchise systems that are useful to practitioners in the implementation of market expansion strategies and to researchers in the continuing effort to further understand international franchising.",0
Misunderstanding Savings Growth: Implications for Retirement Savings Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"People systematically underestimate exponential growth. This article illustrates this phenomenon, its implications, and some potential interventions in the context of saving for retirement, where savings grow exponentially over long periods of time. Experiment 1 shows that a majority of participants expect savings over 40 years to grow linearly rather than exponentially, leading them to grossly underestimate their account balance at retirement. Experiment 2 demonstrates that this misunderstanding leads to underestimates of the cost of waiting to save, which makes putting off saving more attractive than it should be. Finally, Experiments 3?5 show that highlighting the exponential growth of savings motivates both college students and employees to save more for retirement. Making clear to employees the exponential growth of savings before they make crucial decisions about how much to save may be a simple and effective means of increasing retirement savings.",1
Channel Switching between Domestic and Foreign Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"The authors develop a transaction cost model of the circumstances in which small, knowledge-intensive firms switch from the channel they use in the domestic market to a different channel in a foreign market. The authors argue that the domestic channel is frequently extended into a foreign market to gain economies of scale, because product characteristics are generally similar and because of strategic momentum. In knowledge-intensive sectors, integrated channels predominate in both domestic and foreign markets. Integrated channels facilitate the protection of knowledge-based assets and high levels of interaction with customers. However, firms may switch to a less-integrated mode in a foreign market if asset specificity is relatively low, as a response to environmental diversity, and when the market makes a small contribution to overall sales. Data gathered through a disk-by-mail survey of the export channel choices of Canadian software developers generally support these propositions. The authors make a contribution to the literature by rephrasing the channel selection decision so that the conditions under which firms switch modes are emphasized, thus linking the choice of modes in a foreign market to experience in the domestic market. The authors suggest that managers need to be aware of the momentum created by domestic channels and fully evaluate alternatives before extending existing channels into a foreign market. The results help identify conditions under which an international channel strategy that is different from the one used in the home market should be considered for a knowledge-intensive product.",0
Visual Influence and Social Groups,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"New car purchases are among the largest and most expensive purchases consumers ever make. While functional and economic concerns are important, the authors examine whether visual influence also plays a role. Using a hierarchical Bayesian probability model and data on 1.6 million new cars sold over nine years, they examine how visual influence affects purchase volume, focusing on three questions: Are people more likely to buy a new car if others around them have recently done so? Are these effects moderated by visibility, the ease of seeing others? behavior? Do they vary according to the identity (e.g., gender) of prior purchasers and the identity relevance of vehicle type? The authors perform an extensive set of tests to rule out alternatives to visual influence and find that visual effects are (1) present (one additional purchase for approximately every seven prior purchases), (2) larger in areas where others? behavior should be more visible (i.e., more people commute in car-visible ways), (3) stronger for prior purchases by men than by women in male-oriented vehicle types, (4) extant only for cars of similar price tiers, and (5) subject to saturation effects.",1
"A Multicategory Model of Consumers' Purchase Incidence, Quantity, and Brand Choice Decisions: Methodological Issues and Implications on Promotional Decisions",Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors propose a multicategory model of consumers' purchase incidence, quantity, and brand choice decisions. The model specification allows for cross-category promotion effects in both components of the primary demand (incidence and quantity decisions) and uses a flexible functional form of consumer's utility to accurately measure those cross-category effects. To demonstrate the importance of the methodology, the authors investigate two issues of relevance to retailers, namely, how retailers should (1) allocate promotional expenditures across brands in a category and (2) coordinate timing of promotions of brands across categories. The authors estimate the proposed model using consumers' purchases in pasta sauce and pasta categories. The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation of promotional expenditures across brands. Furthermore, retailers are better off contemporaneously promoting brands across the two categories than promoting them in different periods, and ignoring cross-category effects in quantity decisions leads to the opposite inference, namely, that retailers are better off promoting brands across the two categories in different periods.",1
The Role of Marketer-Generated Content in Customer Engagement Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Despite the demonstrated importance of customer sentiment in social media for outcomes such as purchase behavior and of firms? increasing use of customer engagement initiatives, surprisingly few studies have investigated firms? ability to influence the sentiment of customers? digital engagement. Many firms track buyers? offline interactions, design online content to coincide with customers? experiences, and face varied performance during events, enabling the modification of marketer-generated content to correspond to the event outcomes. This study examines the role of firms? social media engagement initiatives surrounding customers? experiential interaction events in influencing the sentiment of customers? digital engagement. Results indicate that marketers can influence the sentiment of customers? digital engagement beyond their performance during customers? interactions, and for unfavorable event outcomes, informational marketer-generated content, more so than emotional content, can enhance customer sentiment. This study also highlights sentiment?s role as a leading indicator for customer lifetime value.",0
Eye Tracking Reveals Processes that Enable Conjoint Choices to Become Increasingly Efficient with Practice,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Choice-based conjoint is a popular technique for characterizing consumers? choices. Three eye-tracking studies explore decision processes in conjoint choices that take less time and become more accurate with practice. These studies reveal two simplification processes that are associated with greater speed and reliability. Alternative focus gradually shifts attention toward options that represent promising choices, whereas attribute focus directs attention to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with practice. In terms of biases, the authors detect a small but consistent focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the items not chosen. They also show that incidental exposures arising from the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices. Overall, conjoint choice is found to be a process that is (1) largely formed by goal-driven values that respondents bring to the task and (2) relatively free of distorting effects from task layout or random exposures.",1
Are Women More Loyal Customers than Men? Gender Differences in Loyalty to Firms and Individual Service Providers,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Prevailing wisdom assumes that female consumers are more loyal than male consumers. The authors report conditions under which the reverse is found, depending on the object of customer loyalty. For example, whereas female consumers tend to be more loyal than male consumers to individuals, such as individual service providers, this difference is reversed when the object of loyalty is a group of people. The authors find a similar crossover interaction effect for loyalty to individual employees versus loyalty to companies. This effect is mediated by self-construal in terms of relational versus collective interdependence. The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these gender differences.",0
Selectively Emotional: How Smartphone Use Changes User-Generated Content,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"User-generated content has become ubiquitous and very influential in the marketplace. Increasingly, this content is generated on smartphones rather than personal computers (PCs). This article argues that because of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn, tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies?two field studies and three controlled experiments?the authors use natural language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect?especially positive affect?relative to PC-generated content. The findings also show that differences in emotional content are driven by the tendency to generate briefer content on smartphones rather than user self-selection, differences in topical content, or timing of writing. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",1
Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-Disclosure,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one?s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.",0
"Decoding Customer?Firm Relationships: How Attachment Styles Help Explain Customers' Preferences for Closeness, Repurchase Intentions, and Changes in Relationship Breadth",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Many firms strive to create relationships with customers, but not all customers are motivated to build close commercial relationships. This article introduces a theoretical framework that explains how relationship-specific attachment styles account for customers' distinct preferences for closeness and how both attachment styles and preferences for closeness influence loyalty. The authors test their predictions with survey data from 1199 insurance customers and three years of purchase records for 975 of these customers. They find that attachment styles predict customers' preferences for closeness better than established marketing variables do. Moreover, attachment styles and preferences for closeness influence loyalty intentions and behavior, controlling for established antecedents (e.g., relationship quality). Finally, exploring the underlying process, the authors show that preference for closeness partially mediates the effect of attachment styles on cross-buying behavior. This research provides novel customer segmentation criteria and actionable guidelines that managers can use to improve their ability to tailor relationship marketing activities and more effectively allocate resources to match customer preferences.",1
Service Robots Rising: How Humanoid Robots Influence Service Experiences and Elicit Compensatory Consumer Responses,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Interactions between consumers and humanoid service robots (HSRs; i.e., robots with a human-like morphology such as a face, arms, and legs) will soon be part of routine marketplace experiences. It is unclear, however, whether these humanoid robots (compared with human employees) will trigger positive or negative consequences for consumers and companies. Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).",1
When Does (Mis)Fit in Customer Orientation Matter for Frontline Employees? Job Satisfaction and Performance?,Journal of Marketing,2016,"The role of coworkers? customer orientation (CO) in influencing an employee's CO has received sparse attention in the literature. This research serves two purposes. First, the study draws on person?group fit theory to develop and test a model of a frontline employee's CO relative to that of his or her coworkers as well as the effects of CO (mis)fit on job satisfaction and service performance through coworker relationship quality. Second, the authors propose three work-group characteristics?group size, service climate strength, and leader?member exchange differentiation?that they expect to mitigate the (negative) positive effect of employee?coworker CO (mis)fit on coworker relationship quality. Data collected in a multirespondent (i.e., frontline employees and supervisors) longitudinal research design indicate that as group size increases, service climate becomes stronger, and group leaders develop different exchange relationships with employees, the inherently (negative) positive role of employee?coworker CO (mis)fit in influencing coworker relationship quality diminishes. Furthermore, coworker relationship quality fully mediates the associations of employee?coworker CO (mis)fit with job satisfaction and service performance. The authors close with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the boundary conditions of CO (mis)fit.",0
Logistics Service Quality as a Segment-Customized Process,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Logistics excellence has become a powerful source of competitive differentiation within diverse marketing offerings of world-class firms. Although researchers have suggested that logistics competencies complement marketing efforts, empirical evidence is lacking on what logistics service quality means to customers and whether it has different meanings for separate customer segments. The authors present empirical support for nine related logistics service quality constructs; demonstrate their unidimensionality, validity, and reliability across four customer segments of a large logistics organization; and provide empirical support for a logistics service quality process. Although structural equation modeling offers support for the logistics service quality process across customer segments, the authors find that the relative parameter estimates differ for each segment, which suggests that firms ought to customize their logistics services by customer segments.",0
Cognitive Inertia and the Implicit Association Test,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors review the implicit association test (IAT), its use in marketing, and the methodology and validity issues that surround it. They focus on a validity problem that has not been investigated previously, namely, the impact of cognitive inertia on IAT effects. Cognitive inertia refers to the difficulty in switching from one categorization rule to another, which causes IAT effects to depend on the order of administration of the two IAT blocks. In Study 1, the authors observe an IAT effect when the compatible block precedes the incompatible block but not when it follows the incompatible block. In Studies 2 and 3, the IAT effect changes its sign when the order of the blocks reverses. Cognitive inertia distorts individual IAT scores and diminishes the correlations between IAT scores and predictor variables when the block order is counterbalanced between subjects. Study 4 shows that counterbalancing the block order repeatedly within subjects can eliminate cognitive inertia effects on the individual level. The authors conclude that researchers should either interpret IAT scores at the aggregate level or, if individual IAT scores are of interest, counterbalance the block order repeatedly within subjects.",1
Choosing among Alternative Service Delivery Modes: An Investigation of Customer Trial of Self-Service Technologies,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Electronic commerce is an increasingly popular business model with a wide range of tools available to firms. An application that is becoming more common is the use of self-service technologies (SSTs), such as telephone banking, automated hotel checkout, and online investment trading, whereby customers produce services for themselves without assistance from firm employees. Widespread introduction of SSTs is apparent across industries, yet relatively little is known about why customers decide to try SSTs and why some SSTs are more widely accepted than others. In this research, the authors explore key factors that influence the initial SST trial decision, specifically focusing on actual behavior in situations in which the consumer has a choice among delivery modes. The authors show that the consumer readiness variables of role clarity, motivation, and ability are key mediators between established adoption constructs (innovation characteristics and individual differences) and the likelihood of trial.",0
Self-Service Technologies: Understanding Customer Satisfaction with Technology-Based Service Encounters,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Self-service technologies (SSTs) are increasingly changing the way customers interact with firms to create service outcomes. Given that the emphasis in the academic literature has focused almost exclusively on the interpersonal dynamics of service encounters, there is much to be learned about customer interactions with technology-based self-service delivery options. In this research, the authors describe the results of a critical incident study based on more than 800 incidents involving SSTs solicited from customers through a Web-based survey. The authors categorize these incidents to discern the sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with SSTs. The authors present a discussion of the resulting critical incident categories and their relationship to customer attributions, complaining behavior, word of mouth, and repeat purchase intentions, which is followed by implications for managers and researchers.",0
(When) are We Dynamically Optimal? A Psychological Field Guide for Marketing Modelers,Journal of Marketing,2016,"A common assumption made in structural approaches to empirical strategy research in marketing is that firms and consumers satisfy the assumptions of dynamic optimality when making decisions. When faced with problems of how best to allocate resources, firms are assumed consider the future consequences of different strategic options and, in each point in time, choose the option that maximizes long-term utility. The validity of such assumptions, however, is often called into question by behavioral researchers who point to work in psychology that finds that assumptions of optimality are frequently violated in experimental settings. If this is indeed the case, it would lend support to approaches that argue that markets have inefficiencies that can be discovered and exploited by simpler, largely correlational, methods. In this article, the authors attempt to reconcile these contrasting views by proposing a framework for assessing when assumptions of dynamic optimality are likely to be good ones and when they are likely to be untenable in empirical analysis.",0
The Role of Mere Closeness: How Geographic Proximity Affects Social Influence,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers? geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions.",0
The Importance of the Context in Brand Extension: How Pictures and Comparisons Shift Consumers' Focus from Fit to Quality,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"It is well established that consumers' evaluations of brand extensions depend on the quality of the parent brand and the fit between that brand and the extension category. The authors propose that the relative importance of these two factors is influenced by two key features of a typical shopping environment: the presence of visual information and the availability of comparison brands. In particular, the authors demonstrate that adding pictures and enabling brand comparisons shift consumers' preference from extensions of better-fitting brands to extensions of higher-quality brands. The authors propose that this occurs because pictures and brand comparisons create a more concrete representation of the extension, which in turn increases the importance of parent brand quality relative to brand?extension fit. They provide support for this underlying mechanism and discuss the practical implications of their findings.",1
(De)marketing to Manage Consumer Quality Inferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Savvy consumers attribute a product's market performance to its intrinsic quality as well as the seller's marketing push. The authors study how sellers should optimize their marketing decisions in response. They find that a seller can benefit from ?demarketing? its product, meaning visibly toning down its marketing efforts. Demarketing lowers expected sales ex ante but improves product quality image ex post, as consumers attribute good sales to superior quality and lackluster sales to insufficient marketing. The authors derive conditions under which demarketing can be a recommendable business strategy. A series of experiments confirm these predictions.",1
Trading on Up: An Examination of Factors Influencing the Degree of Upgrade: Evidence from Cash for Clunkers,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Durable goods firms often create product lineups to provide a clear upgrading path as consumers make replacement decisions. Consumers can upgrade a little (i.e., spend a bit more than last time) or a lot (i.e., spend substantially more). However, the factors affecting the degree of such vertical ?moving up? have received limited scholarly attention. In particular, little is known about how trade-in characteristics and the marginal costs?benefits of the new purchase influence the degree of upgrade. The authors use 320,000 Cash for Clunkers automobile transactions to provide the first examination of how mental accounting surpluses from trade-in ownership time and trade-in windfall, in addition to brand loyalty, affect the degree of upgrade. The authors find that trade-in ownership time and brand loyalty enhance the replacement?s degree of upgrade. However, trade-in windfall size has a negative effect, revealing the downside of this common promotional practice. Two experiments and additional dealer data indicate that this finding is robust to different economic conditions. Thus, these findings provide valuable new guidance for durable goods firms to facilitate the degree to which consumers upgrade.",0
How Should Consumers? Willingness to Pay be Measured? An Empirical Comparison of State-of-the-Art Approaches,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This study compares the performance of four commonly used approaches to measure consumers? willingness to pay with real purchase data (REAL): the open-ended (OE) question format; choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis; Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (BDM) incentive-compatible mechanism; and incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (ICBC) analysis. With this five-in-one approach, the authors test the relative strengths of the four measurement methods, using REAL as the benchmark, on the basis of statistical criteria and decision-relevant metrics. The results indicate that the BDM and ICBC approaches can pass statistical and decision-oriented tests. The authors find that respondents are more price sensitive in incentive-aligned settings than in non-incentive-aligned settings and the REAL setting. Furthermore, they find a large number of ?none? choices under ICBC than under hypothetical conjoint analysis. This study uncovers an intriguing possibility: Even when the OE format and CBC analysis generate hypothetical bias, they may still lead to the right demand curves and right pricing decisions.",1
Executive Insights: The 10-Step Road Map to Success in Foreign Markets?1,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This article describes a systematic process for taking a company through the internationalization process. Based upon extensive firsthand experience with both small and large companies, the author proposes and details a step-by-step process designed to take the mystery out of the internationalization challenge and, at the same time, to minimize the risks of going international in a haphazard manner. Specific ideas and helpful tips are offered for each step.",0
Perspectives: The Radical Shift to Global Executive Education?A Look Back from the Year 2007,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Exciting changes have occurred in the field of management and executive education in recent years?very likely the beginnings of a revolution in this field that is expected to continue into the next decade. Already we see the signs of a major shift toward a broad context for management and executive education?that is, global leadership and learning development. This change is being driven by the needs of companies that must operate in a highly competitive global environment. These companies increasingly recognize the need to develop leaders who are equally comfortable and effective working anywhere in the world.This article is written from the vantage point of the year 2007 to provide a perspective of how this revolution might appear as we look back at the decade from 1997 to 2007.",0
Executive Insights: Guiding Companies to Successful Exporting in an Interactive Group Format?Lessons from a Collaborative Project,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Guiding small and mid-sized companies to internationalization can be problematic due to a number of unique characteristics of these firms. The authors describe a unique and successful process for ensuring continued success in foreign markets through a program they have developed in partnership with a local utility company. The Export Success Program provides the client companies with a structured approach in an interactive group format, thus allowing much more opportunity to create the culture shift necessary to successfully enter foreign markets.",0
Market Pioneer and Early Follower Survival Risks: A Contingency Analysis of Really New versus Incrementally New Product-Markets,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Does the first entrant in a new market have a difficult time surviving or do first-mover advantages provide protection from outright failure? This empirical study of 264 new industrial product-markets yields insights into this controversial research topic. The key data analysis insights arise through a comparison of survival risks in markets that were started with a really new product and in those that were started with an incremental innovation. When a pioneer starts a new market with a really new product, it can be a major challenge just to survive. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, market pioneer survival risks are much lower. Notably, early followers have the same survival risk across both types of markets. Overall, these results indicate that in markets started by a really new product, the first to market is often the first to fail. In contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, it appears that first-mover advantages protect the pioneer from outright failure.",0
Customer Acquisition and Retention Spending: An Analytical Model and Empirical Investigation in Wireless Telecommunications Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Strategic resource allocation in growth markets is always a challenging task. This is especially true when it comes to determining the level of investments and expenditures for customer acquisition and retention in competitive and dynamic market environments. This study develops an analytical model to examine firms? investments in customer acquisition and retention for a new service; it develops hypotheses drawing on analytical findings and tests them with firm-level operating data of wireless telecommunications markets from 41 countries during 1999?2007. The empirical investigation shows that a firm's acquisition cost per customer is more sensitive to market position and competition than retention cost per customer. Furthermore, whereas firms leading in market share, on average, do not have a cost advantage over other firms in retaining customers, they have a substantial cost advantage in acquiring customers, and this advantage tends to increase with market penetration. The study results provide guidelines for firms? strategic resource allocation for customer acquisition and retention in competitive service markets.",1
Retailers? Use of Partially Comparative Pricing: From Across-Category to Within-Category Effects,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Prior research suggests that partially comparative pricing?in which a retailer provides price comparisons for some, but not all, of its products?is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, such pricing improves beliefs about the retailer's competitive price advantage on comparatively priced products for which its prices are compared with a competitor. On the other hand, it has been shown to damage perceptions of the retailer's noncomparatively priced products relative to those charged by the competition. However, this latter outcome is based on evidence examining the influence of partially comparative pricing across different product categories. The authors propose and demonstrate in five studies that price comparisons may actually improve relative price beliefs about the noncomparatively priced brands within the same product category. They further show this improvement to be attenuated as the number of price comparisons increase or when the price comparison is attached to a brand perceived as less typical of the product category. The authors conclude by drawing managerial implications and offer suggestions for further research.",0
What Drives Managerial Use of Marketing and Financial Metrics and Does Metric Use Affect Performance of Marketing-Mix Activities?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"To increase marketing's accountability, Journal of Marketing, Marketing Science Institute, and the Institute for the Study of Business Markets have advocated development of marketing metrics and linking marketing-mix activities with financial metrics. Although the marketing field has made progress, researchers have paid less attention to what drives managerial use of marketing and financial metrics and whether metric use is associated with marketing-mix performance. The authors propose a conceptual model that links firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and managerial, firm, and environmental characteristics to marketing and financial metric use, which in turn are linked to performance of marketing-mix activities. An analysis of 1287 marketing-mix activities reported by 439 U.S. managers reveals that firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and firm and environmental characteristics are more useful than managerial characteristics in explaining use of marketing and financial metrics and that use of metrics is positively associated with marketing-mix performance. The results help identify conditions under which managers use fewer metrics and how metric use can be increased to improve marketing-mix performance.",0
Expatriate Consumers? Adaptations and Food Brand Choices: A Compensatory Control Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"The number of expatriates has been steadily growing during the last two decades. For these reasons, academia has exhibited a growing research interest in expatriates? food consumption choices. Although interest is there, the extant literature is inconclusive about conditions under which expatriate consumers make trade-offs between host-country (local) and global food products and brands. The present study presents mechanisms that explain expatriate consumers? compensatory coping behaviors and choices between local versus global food brands. By drawing on compensatory control theory and the person?environment fit framework, the authors test the influence of adaptation efforts and retail system properties on expatriate consumers? food brand choices. Survey findings from 232 expatriates who currently live in five Middle Eastern countries reveal that a higher engagement in adaptation efforts (acculturation and general adjustment) leads to a dominant preference for local (vs. global) food brands. Moreover, this study illuminates the importance of retail system properties by showing that a host country?s retail system development positively moderates the relationship between adaptation efforts and local food brand choices, whereas retail similarity has a negative impact.",0
We are what we Consume: The Influence of Food Consumption on Impulsive Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Consumers? impulsive choices have traditionally been attributed either to contextual factors, such as product attributes and store environment, or to individual personality traits. In this article, the authors find that type of food consumed can also influence impulsive choice. Specifically, food that enhances the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin can reduce impulsive choice. To test the hypotheses on the influence of serotonin on postconsumption impulsive choice, the authors collected data on the eve of Thanksgiving. The occasion of Thanksgiving dinner provides a naturalistic setting in which people consume a tryptophan-rich meal (tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin). The authors replicate these findings and obtain converging evidence in a lab setting in which they give some participants a tryptophan-rich beverage and observe their postconsumption impulsive choices.",1
The Influence of Price Discount versus Bonus Pack on the Preference for Virtue and Vice Foods,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors find that consumers prefer a bonus pack to a price discount for virtue foods but they prefer a price discount to a bonus pack for vice foods. Prior research has shown that, all else being equal, consumers prefer bonus packs to price discounts. The authors propose that this preference does not hold for vice food, because consumers cannot generate good justifications for buying such food when a bonus pack is offered because this would mean consuming more of the vice. However, a price discount on a vice food can be justified because it acts as a guilt-mitigating mechanism. For virtue foods, the absence of both anticipated postconsumption guilt and the resultant need to justify leads consumers to prefer a bonus pack to a price discount. The authors demonstrate the proposed effect and test its underlying process across five experiments.",1
How Salary Receipt Affects Consumers? Regulatory Motivations and Product Preferences,Journal of Marketing,2010,"In this article, the authors find that consumers? preferences change as a function of their temporal distance from the receipt of their last salary. The authors propose and test that when consumers have just received their salary (?the near-salary condition?), they exhibit promotion motivations in their product preferences. However, they exhibit prevention motivations in their product preferences when significant time has elapsed since their last salary receipt (?the far-from-salary condition?). The authors collected data from two longitudinal studies to validate these findings and to test the underlying process. Using actual purchase behavior and collecting product preference during a one-month period, the authors show that consumers? product preferences change in response to temporal distance from their last salary receipt. The findings suggest to managers that the best time to promote products or messages with a promotion appeal is near to consumers? last salary receipt and that the best time to promote products or messages with a prevention appeal is far from consumers? last salary receipt.",0
Corporate Social Responsibility and Shareholder Wealth: The Role of Marketing Capability,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Despite the positive societal implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there remains an extensive debate regarding its consequences for firm shareholders. This study posits that marketing capability plays a complementary role in the CSR?shareholder wealth relationship. It further argues that the influence of marketing capability will be higher for CSR types with verifiable benefits to firm stakeholders (i.e., consumers, employees, channel partners, and regulators). An analysis utilizing secondary information for a large sample of 1,725 firms for the years 2000?2009 indicates that the effects of overall CSR efforts on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk are not significant on their own but only become so in the presence of marketing capability. Furthermore, the results reveal that although marketing capability has positive interaction effects with verifiable CSR efforts?environment (e.g., using clean energy), products (e.g., providing to economically disadvantaged), diversity (e.g., pursuing diversity in top management), corporate governance (e.g., limiting board compensation), and employees (e.g., supporting unions)?on stock returns (and negative interaction effects with these CSR efforts on idiosyncratic risk), it has no significant interaction effect with community-based efforts (e.g., charitable giving).",0
Why Do Customer Relationship Management Applications Affect Customer Satisfaction?,Journal of Marketing,2005,This research evaluates the effect of customer relationship management (CRM) on customer knowledge and customer satisfaction. An analysis of archival data for a cross-section of U.S. firms shows that the use of CRM applications is positively associated with improved customer knowledge and improved customer satisfaction. This article also shows that gains in customer knowledge are enhanced when firms share their customer-related information with their supply chain partners.,0
Whose Culture Matters? Near-Market Knowledge and Its Impact on Foreign Market Entry Timing,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Market entry decisions are some of a firm's most important strategic choices. Although some recent studies have begun to consider the impact of learning and experience on foreign market entry, no study has examined the impact of a firm's own operations in similar markets on subsequent entry decisions. In this study, the authors introduce the concept of near-market knowledge to reflect the knowledge firms generate by operating in markets that are culturally and economically similar. The authors compile extensive data on the complete foreign market entries of 19 multinational firms. They use a hazard model on 722 entry observations to evaluate the impact of the dynamic near-market knowledge measures and other economic and cultural variables on foreign market entry timing. In contrast with much previous research, the authors find that cultural distance from the domestic market is not a significant factor. However, the authors find significant effects for the new measures of near-market cultural and economic knowledge and for several other economic variables as well. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for further research and management practice.",1
Does Academic Research Help or Hurt MBA Programs?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Since the 1960s, scientific academic research has played a prominent role in most leading business schools. Recently, however, critics have argued that emphasizing research is misguided and may only serve the faculty's interests at the expense of students and the firms that employ them. This study attempts to inform this debate by investigating the short- and long-term effects of academic research in 57 business schools over 18 years on academics?, recruiters?, and applicants? perceptions as well as on the schools? education performance with current students. The authors find that academic research has positive long-term effects on the perceptions of these three constituents and on education performance, as well as short-term effects on academics? perceptions. Moreover, effect sizes are large and meaningful. A persistent increase of three single-author articles per year is associated with an improvement in a school's ranking among academics by one place, a decline in its acceptance rate of 1%, and an increase in graduates? average annual starting salary of more than $750. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and present related opportunities for further research.",0
"Satisfaction, Repurchase Intent, and Repurchase Behavior: Investigating the Moderating Effect of Customer Characteristics",Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Despite the claim that satisfaction ratings are linked to repurchase behavior, few attempts can be found that relate satisfaction ratings to actual repurchase behavior. This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.",1
Geographic Patterns in Customer Service and Satisfaction: An Empirical Investigation,Journal of Marketing,2004,"When firms? customers are located in geographically dispersed areas, it can be difficult to manage service quality because its relative importance is likely to vary spatially. This article shows how addressing such spatial aspects of satisfaction data can improve management's ability to implement programs aimed at enhancing service quality. Specifically, managers can identify areas of high service responsiveness, that is, areas in which overall satisfaction is low but customers are highly responsive to improvements in service quality. The authors estimate the spatial patterns using geographically weighted regression, a technique that accounts for spatial dependence in the variables. They apply this methodology to a large national sample of automobile customers served by a network of dealerships across the United States. The authors also investigate the extent to which factors related to the physical and psychological landscape explain the importance that people in different regions place on dealership service and vehicle quality.",0
The Role of Issue Valence and Issue Capability in Determining Effort Investment,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"How decision makers invest their effort among various issues is critical to organizational success (Ocasio 1997). The authors investigate the effects of issue valence and issue capability on how decision makers allocate effort to an issue. They develop hypotheses regarding these constructs and test them in three studies. Results show that in the condition of high capability, decision makers are more likely to invest effort in an issue that is negatively, rather than positively, framed. Conversely, with low capability, they are more likely to invest effort in an issue that is positively, rather than negatively, framed. Results also clarify the variable focus on upside potential and risk taking as two mechanisms that underlie this preference reversal.",1
The Theory and Practice of Myopic Management,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This article reviews the theory and empirical evidence of myopic management as it pertains to marketing practice. It documents empirically the stock market's inability to properly value marketing and innovation activity in the face of the potential for myopic management. The author assesses the total financial consequences of myopic management (the practice of cutting marketing and research-and-development spending to inflate earnings) and finds that myopia has a long-term net negative impact on firm value. Myopic management is contrasted with accounting accruals-based earnings inflation, and the author shows that the real activities (i.e., myopic management), and not the accounting numbers manipulation, have the greater negative impact on future financial performance. These results are consistent across alternative abnormal return measures and alternative benchmarks. The author argues that shareholders, managers, and marketing researchers can play a role in limiting myopic management practices.",1
Assessing the Total Financial Performance Impact of Brand Equity with Limited Time-Series Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"One of the key challenges in empirically modeling the total impact of marketing assets on financial performance is the limited availability of marketing metrics data over time. The author presents an approach for estimating the total financial impact of marketing assets with limited time-series data and demonstrates the approach with an application to brand equity research. Consistent with prior research, the aggregate analyses indicate that brand equity, as measured by customer mindset metrics, positively affects current financial performance. In addition, the author documents brand equity's significant and much greater impact on the firm's future financial performance: at the aggregate, only a small portion of the total financial impact of brand equity is reflected in current-year profits, whereas the bulk of the profitability impact is realized in the future. Most importantly, however, the analyses document significant heterogeneity of these effects: in some industries, the entire direct impact is contemporaneous, whereas in others, no contemporaneous effects are observed and all of the profitability impact occurs in the future.",1
Trading off between Value Creation and Value Appropriation: The Financial Implications of Shifts in Strategic Emphasis,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Firms allocate their limited resources between two fundamental processes of creating value (i.e., innovating, producing, and delivering products to the market) and appropriating value (i.e., extracting profits in the marketplace). Although both value creation and value appropriation are required for achieving sustained competitive advantage, a firm has significant latitude in deciding the extent to which it emphasizes one over the other. What effect does strategic emphasis (i.e., emphasis on value creation versus value appropriation) have on firm's financial performance? The authors address this issue by examining the effect that shifts in strategic emphasis have on stock return. They find that the stock market reacts favorably when a firm increases its emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation. This effect, however, is moderated by firm and industry characteristics, in particular, financial performance, the past level of strategic emphasis of the firm, and the technological environment in which the firm operates. These results do not negate the importance of value creation capabilities, but rather highlight the importance of isolating mechanisms that enable the firm to appropriate some of the value it has created.",0
The Financial Value Impact of Perceptual Brand Attributes,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors assess which brand asset metrics provide incremental information content to accounting performance measures in explaining stock return. The analysis focuses on the five ?pillars? (i.e., central brand attributes) that form the basis for the newly updated Young that is, their effects are reflected in current-term accounting measures and in brand relevance and energy. The financial markets do not view brand differentiation as having incremental information content, but they should. Changes in differentiation are indicative of future-term accounting performance, which in turn affects stock return. These conclusions are invariant to the use of alternative accounting performance measures, risk adjustments, and the inclusion of additional brand attributes into the analysis.",1
Valuing Branded Businesses,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The authors develop and validate a conditional multiplier approach for valuing branded businesses. The approach enhances traditional multiplier-based valuation by explicitly incorporating brand characteristics into the model. The authors present theoretical arguments why, develop a model to demonstrate how, and provide an empirical illustration to show that brand assets are not fully reflected in contemporaneous margins, and therefore valuation accuracy can be improved by incorporating information about the properties of the firm's brand asset directly into a valuation framework. The authors find that brand metrics have statistically significant associations with valuation multipliers and add incremental explanatory power to accounting variables in explaining valuation multipliers. Out-of-sample analysis shows a 16% improvement in the mean absolute error for predictions that take into account brand metrics compared with predictions based on accounting variables alone.",0
What Are Likes Worth? A Facebook Page Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Despite the tremendous resources devoted to marketing on Facebook, little is known about its actual effect on customers. Specifically, can Facebook page likes affect offline customer behavior, and if so, how? To answer these questions, the authors conduct a field experiment on acquired Facebook page likes and find them to have a positive causal effect on offline customer behavior. Importantly, these likes are found to be most effective when the Facebook page is used as a platform for firm-initiated promotional communications. No effect of acquired page likes is found when customers interact organically with the firm's page, but a significant effect is found when the firm pays to boost its page posts and thus uses its Facebook page as a platform for paid advertising. These results demonstrate the value of likes beyond Facebook activity itself and highlight the conditions under which acquiring likes is most valuable for firms.",1
An Empirical Two-Stage Choice Model with Varying Decision Rules Applied to Internet Clickstream Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this article, the author proposes and applies an empirical two-stage choice model to Internet clickstream data that captures observed choices for two choice stages: products viewed and products purchased. The model allows for interdependences between choices within a stage as well as the use of varying decision rules in each stage. The author accommodates heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and criterion attributes. The results show empirically, in a field setting, that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in both stages. From a managerial perspective, the identification of criterion attributes, coupled with the preference parameters estimated by the model, can assist with the targeting and positioning of promotional strategies.",1
Modeling Hedonic Portfolio Products: A Joint Segmentation Analysis of Music Compact Disc Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors present a framework that enables researchers to differentiate better among a wide array of hedonic products. Specifically, the authors define and discuss characteristics of hedonic portfolio products and offer a joint segmentation model that is appropriate for understanding the sales dynamics of this class of products. The model offered in this article can accommodate a large degree of product heterogeneity through product clusters and model covariates. The basic premise is that several generic consumer segments exist and remain fixed across all albums, and each album (or each cluster of similar albums) can be viewed as drawing different proportions from each of these underlying segments. The authors also allow explanatory variables to have a differential impact on both components of the model?that is, accelerating purchase rates within a consumer segment and changing the proportions drawn from each consumer segment by each product cluster?thereby expanding or contracting the potential market size. The authors apply this model to music compact disc sales for 20 different albums and discuss the different effects of radio airplay and holiday buying on sales for a sample in the music industry.",1
The Value of Social Dynamics in Online Product Ratings Forums,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Research has shown that consumer online product ratings reflect both the customers' experience with the product and the influence of others' ratings. In this article, the authors measure the impact of social dynamics in the ratings environment on both subsequent rating behavior and product sales. First, they model the arrival of product ratings and separate the effects of social influences from the underlying (or baseline) ratings behavior. Second, the authors model product sales as a function of posted product ratings while decomposing ratings into a baseline rating, the contribution of social influence, and idiosyncratic error. This enables them to quantify the sales impact of observed social dynamics. The authors consider both the direct effects on sales and the indirect effects that result from the influence of dynamics on future ratings (and thus future sales). The results show that although ratings behavior is significantly influenced by previously posted ratings and can directly improve sales, the effects are relatively short lived once indirect effects are considered.",1
Inertial Disruption: The Impact of a New Competitive Entrant on Online Consumer Search,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The objective of this article is to examine the impact of a new competitive entry on online consumer search behavior. The authors use store visitation as a measure of online search and decompose a shopper's tendency to search a given Web site into a baseline search preference for that site and an inertial effect of visiting that site. They find that inertia is an important driver in search behavior and is easily disrupted by a new competitive entry. This is a new and significant finding that contributes to the competitive entry literature. The authors develop a Bayesian model of search that separates the role of baseline search preference and inertia on store visitation and captures the effect of a new competitive entry. They apply this model to Internet clickstream data for the online bookstore market, in which they focus on the entry of Borders.com in 1998.",0
Inpatriate Marketing Managers: Issues Associated with Staffing Global Marketing Positions,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This article addresses the strategic role of an inpatriate marketing staffing approach in the development of a global marketing mind-set within global organizations. The premise lies in addressing the liability-of-foreignness concept, which, the authors suggest, impedes the inpatriate marketing manager's integration process, from the individual level of analysis. Drawing from reference point theory, the article highlights potential hardships manages face with an analysis of the managerial and contextual liability of foreignness that inpatriate marketing managers may perceive in their transition from home countries to headquarter locations. Implications of identifying and attending to such hardships are important in light of the significance attributed to these semipermanent to permanent assignments across different cultural contexts.",0
Executive Insights: Use of the Internet in International Marketing: A Case Study of Small Computer Software Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"This study focuses on how small exporting firms use the Internet in their international marketing activities. The authors conducted six case studies of software firms. The software sector has several notable features: It is one of the world's fastest-growing industries, its products can be distributed electronically, and software companies are ?Internet literate.? This study's findings suggest that most firms use the Internet to search for information about customers, distributors, and partners. The Internet does not replace personal sales; most firms reported a rather complex purchasing process and an extensive need for communication with customers before the purchase decision. The authors found standardized products to be most suited for Internet-based sales; however, standardization reduced firms? competitive advantage and profit margins. Software firms? most significant use of the Internet was for postsales service and support activities; these activities both generated revenue and improved customer relations. Partnership agreements with well-known firms, positive product reviews, and image building through the Internet were important to most firms in order to reduce the uncertainty that potential customers often experience when unknown suppliers offer unfamiliar products. The authors also discuss implications for managers in industrial sectors other than software.",0
Born Global or Gradual Global? Examining the Export Behavior of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Over the past decade, several studies have questioned the stage models of the internationalization process. Many of these studies concentrate on the exporting versus nonexporting factor, identifying an increasing number of firms that are active in international markets shortly after establishment. Limited empirical evidence exists as to whether this actuality indicates simply a reduced time factor in the preexport phase or an important change in the export behavior of firms. Using small and medium-sized exporting firms from Norway, Denmark, and France, the authors focus on the concept of gradual development. The results suggest that export intensity, distribution, market selection, and global orientation are not influenced by the firm's year of establishment or first year of exporting activity. One-third of the firms sampled reported that the time period between establishment and export commencement was less than two years. In terms of export intensity, these firms outperform those that waited several years before exporting. The results indicate that the future export involvement of a firm is, to a large extent, influenced by its behavior shortly after establishment. The results further indicate that the development of resources in support of international market competitiveness may be regarded as the key issue and that the basic resources and competencies of the firm are determined during the establishment phase. The authors review how the management challenges differ depending on the type of firm (age and export involvement) in question.",0
The Effect of Marketer-Suggested Serving Size on Consumer Responses: The Unintended Consequences of Consumer Attention to Calorie Information,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Nutritional labels are mandatory on virtually all packaged food items sold in the United States. The nutritional information on these labels is reported on a ?per-serving-size? basis. However, unbeknownst to many consumers, current Food and Drug Administration regulations allow manufacturers some discretion in setting serving sizes?a factor that the authors hypothesize has implications for consumer behavior. For example, adopting a smaller serving size allows marketers to reduce the reported calories, fat, sugar, and carbohydrates in a product serving, which in turn can influence the anticipated consequences of consumption. Three studies show that manipulating the serving size, and thus calories per serving, for equivalent consumption amounts influences the anticipated guilt of consumption, purchase intentions, and choice behavior. However, the results also show that individual difference and context variables, which heighten consumer attention to nutritional information in general, often focus attention on calorie information but not serving size. This leads to the counterintuitive finding that more nutritionally vigilant consumers are more heavily influenced by serving size manipulations. The authors discuss the managerial and public policy implications.",0
A Global Investigation into the Cultural and Individual Antecedents of Banner Advertising Effectiveness,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"This study introduces and tests a framework to show the influence of national-level cultural and sociodemographic variables on banner advertising effectiveness. The authors analyze online survey data from 7775 respondents from 34 countries using hierarchical linear modeling and also analyze click-through rates from 2192 users from 26 countries. The findings show that banner advertising effectiveness in terms of attitudes toward banner advertising and intention to click on banner ads varies along Hofstede's cultural dimensions of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity. In particular, consumers from individualist countries show less acceptance of banner advertising than those from collectivist countries. The acceptance of Web banner advertising is related to the consumers? click behavior. Individual-level variables contribute only marginally to explain banner advertising effectiveness, which strengthens the significance of the direct effects of national-level cultural variables. The findings suggest that marketers should view banner advertising, though largely standardized when targeting a global audience, as a culture-specific issue.",0
Lost in a Universe of Markets: Toward a Theory of Market Scoping for Early-Stage Technologies,Journal of Marketing,2018,"This article examines market scoping for early-stage technologies, a fundamental yet underexplored marketing activity. Market scoping refers to managerial activities directed at the identification of market spaces for early-stage technologies. This discovery-oriented research aimed at theory development draws on an extensive, multiyear database of email trails and archival records detailing market-scoping efforts for early-stage technologies emerging from a global research university. From this longitudinal database, the authors provide an in-depth examination of managers? market space decisions and advance an initial theory of market scoping. They isolate managers? market-scoping mindset?which manifests as market ambiguity avoidance or acceptance?as a key explanatory construct shaping market space decisions and outcomes. Market ambiguity avoidance results in managers? downstream orientation toward end users; this mindset, counterintuitively, may lead to technology commercialization failure. In contrast, market ambiguity acceptance results in managers? upstream orientation; this mindset directs attention away from end users but helps uncover indirect paths to viable market spaces. This article lays the groundwork for advancing marketing research in the context of early-stage technology commercialization.",0
Fading Optimism in Products: Temporal Changes in Expectations about Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors demonstrate that choosing one product from a set of competing alternatives can change expectations about the chosen product such that consumers can become optimistic about the product's performance, and this optimism can then fade away. In five experiments, the authors show that this phenomenon of fading optimism in products is robust across different experimental settings and product categories and is moderated by prior attitude toward the product category and ambiguity of the product's performance.",1
The Influence of Mating Mind-Sets on Brand Extension Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Prior research has identified several factors that influence brand extension evaluations. Extending this research, the authors suggest that external, situational factors can have an important influence on brand extension evaluations. This research focuses on mating mind-sets (i.e., thinking about a mate), which consumers commonly experience. Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the external situation can influence brand extension evaluations, particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions. These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set). Furthermore, using prestige brands (vs. functional brands) reduces the gap between men and women. In addition, subbrand architecture (vs. direct brand architecture) boosts the evaluations of female consumers but decreases those of male consumers. The authors find that the effects of mating mind-sets on brand extension evaluation are driven by male consumers' need to express creativity.",1
What Makes Brands Elastic? The Influence of Brand Concept and Styles of Thinking on Brand Extension Evaluation,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Why are some brands more elastic than others? Prior research shows that consumers are more accepting of extensions into distant product categories for brands with prestige concepts (Rolex) than for brands with functional concepts (Timex). In this article, the authors examine consumers? style of thinking?analytic versus holistic thinking?to better understand the elasticity of prestige versus functional brands. For functional brands, the authors find that holistic thinkers provide more favorable responses to distant extensions than analytic thinkers; however, for prestige brands, holistic and analytic thinkers respond equally favorably. Thus, analytic thinkers are identified as the roadblocks for functional brands launching distant brand extensions. To meet this challenge, the authors offer several strategies, including (1) using a subbrand (Excer wallets by Toyota) instead of a direct brand (Toyota wallets) to reduce analytic thinking; (2) using elaborational communications, which address potentially problematic features of the extension, to reduce analytic thinking; and (3) matching extension information with the consumer's style of thinking, which increases the persuasiveness of ad messages.",0
Blending Cobrand Personalities: An Examination of the Complex Self,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This research examines the role of self-complexity in influencing consumer responses to cobrands with trait associations to two distinct brand personality dimensions versus one distinct brand personality dimension. Three experiments reveal that consumers whose complex self becomes activated prefer cobrands that exude both sophistication and excitement to those that exhibit either sophistication or excitement. Caucasians, who have a more complex independent self, tend to evaluate a sophisticated and excited personality cobrand more favorably when primed on independence, whereas Hispanics, who have a more complex interdependent self, tend to evaluate this cobrand personality combination more favorably when primed on interdependence. This research also suggests that this self-complexity-driven process is conscious in nature.",1
Contract Specificity and Its Performance Implications,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Governance theories, such as transaction cost economics, argue that systematic deviations from an attribute?governance alignment should influence performance. This article investigates the performance implications of contract specificity for the procurement of information technology products. The authors argue that parties choose a level of contract specificity that economizes on both the ex ante contracting costs and the ex post transaction costs and that deviations between the observed and the predicted levels of contract specificity are an important determinant of these transaction costs. The authors test the hypotheses using a comprehensive archival data set of information technology transactions and employ a two-step estimation procedure. First, they estimate the ?predicted? level of contract specificity, which accounts for key transactional attributes. Second, they study the consequences of deviating from this predicted level of contractual specificity. The results provide the first explicit demonstration of the trade-off between ex ante contracting costs and ex post transaction problems and suggest that parties need to economize jointly on these costs when choosing the governance form.",0
Nonprofit Versus For-Profit Health Care Competition: How Service Mix Makes Nonprofit Hospitals More Profitable,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This article studies the intersection between the largest U.S. industry?health care?and the $1 trillion nonprofit sector. Using analytical and empirical analyses, the authors reveal the marketing strategies helping private nonprofit hospitals achieve higher output, prices, and profits than for-profit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals, focusing on both profits and output, obtain these outcomes by expanding their service mix with high-priced premium specialty medical services (PSMS), whereas for-profit hospitals can be more profitable with higher prices for basic services. Competition increases the differences between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in PSMS breadth, output, and prices. Nonprofit hospitals lose their competitive advantage when competing with other nonprofits; that is, presence of a for-profit competitor broadens available nonprofit PSMS. With broader service mixes, nonprofits focus more on national advertising than for-profits because PSMS (e.g., pediatric trauma, neurosurgery, heart transplants, oncology) require larger geographic markets than local basic services (e.g., laboratory, diagnostics, nursing, pharmaceutics). Exogenous, heterogeneous state regulations restricting for-profit hospital entry help econometric identification (i.e., markets prohibiting for-profits act as controls). Service mix may be a key difference between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals.",1
"Dynamic Effects among Movie Ratings, Movie Revenues, and Viewer Satisfaction",Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research investigates how movie ratings from professional critics, amateur communities, and viewers themselves influence key movie performance measures (i.e., movie revenues and new movie ratings). Using movie-level data, the authors find that high early movie revenues enhance subsequent movie ratings. They also find that high advertising spending on movies supported by high ratings maximizes the movie's revenues. Furthermore, they empirically show that sequel movies tend to reap more revenues but receive lower ratings than originals. Using individual viewer?level data, this research highlights how viewers? own viewing and rating histories and movie communities? collective opinions explain viewer satisfaction. The authors find that various aspects of these ratings explain viewers? new movie ratings as a measure of viewer satisfaction, after controlling for movie characteristics. Furthermore, they find that viewers? movie experiences can cause them to become more critical in ratings over time. Finally, they find a U-shaped relationship between viewers? genre preferences and genre-specific movie ratings for heavy viewers.",0
Estimating Promotion Response When Competitive Promotions Are Unobservable,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This study addresses a problem commonly encountered by marketers who attempt to assess the impact of their sales promotions?namely, the lack of data on competitive marketing activity. In most industries, competing firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters. Furthermore, the proposed model provides better predictive validity than the benchmark models.",1
Cultural and Economic Impacts on Global Cultural Products: Evidence from U.S. Movies,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Existing international product diffusion studies have identified economic and cultural factors that influence consumers? acceptance of new products, but they have not fully examined these factors? roles in the international diffusion of global cultural products. The authors examine country-level economic and cultural factors that influence consumers? acceptance of new global cultural products across countries. Using 846 recent U.S. movies? box office performances in 48 national markets as the empirical context, the authors obtain the following key novel findings on product sales: (1) an inverse U-shaped impact of economic development status, (2) a positive impact of the cultural compatibility of the product and the market, and (3) a U-shaped impact of intercountry cultural distance in the presence of cultural compatibility and a decreasing linear impact of cultural distance in the absence of cultural compatibility.",0
Passing the Torch: Intergenerational Influences as a Source of Brand Equity,Journal of Marketing,2002,"In today's competitive battleground, the concept of brand equity has proved to be an important source of strategic insights for marketers. However, one potentially valuable source of brand equity?the operation of intergenerational influences?has generally been overlooked in the marketing literature. This article reports the findings of two studies that show intergenerational impacts on brand equity to be persistent and powerful across an array of consumer packaged goods. However, as a strategic challenge, these effects seem to apply strongly for some brands but not for others?they are selective. In Study 1, the authors use parallel surveys of mother?daughter dyads to isolate and quantify intergenerational impacts, and the surveys reveal a differential range of effects at both the product category and the brand level. In Study 2, the authors use interpretivist methods to delve more deeply into these effects?the forms they take, the way they have developed, and factors that sustain or disrupt them. On the basis of these findings, the authors identify implications for managers and future research needs. Overall, intergenerational influences are a real marketplace phenomenon and a factor that merits much closer attention from marketing strategists who are interested in brand equity issues.",0
Organizing for Marketing Excellence,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Marketing organization is the interface of the firm with its markets and where the work of marketing gets done. This review of the past 25 years of scholarship on marketing organization examines the individual and integrative roles of four elements of marketing organization?capabilities, configuration (including structure, metrics, and incentives), culture, and the human capital of marketing leadership and talent. The authors indicate that these four elements are mobilized through seven marketing activities (7As) that occur during the marketing strategy process. These activities enable the firm to anticipate market changes, adapt the strategy to stay ahead of competition, align the organization to the strategy and market, activate effective implementation, ensure accountability for results, attract resources, and manage marketing assets. How well the firm manages these seven activities throughout the marketing strategy process determines the performance payoffs from marketing organization. Future research priorities outlined for the elements of marketing organization, their integration, and their impact on the 7As offer directions for the study of organizing for marketing excellence.",0
Price Matching by Vertically Differentiated Retailers: Theory and Evidence,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This research examines vertically differentiated retailers' incentives to offer price-matching guarantees. It suggests that offering and not offering a price-matching guarantee are both signals of a retailer's service-price profile, a way of branding the retailer to uninformed consumers. The signals are made credible and costless by the presence of informed consumers. The authors show that when the service differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied.",1
Product Contagion: Changing Consumer Evaluations through Physical Contact with ?Disgusting? Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This research demonstrates the strong influence of disgust in a consumer context. Specifically, it shows how consumer evaluations may change in response to physical contact with products that elicit only moderate levels of disgust. Using evidence from six studies, the authors develop a theory of product contagion, in which disgusting products are believed to transfer offensive properties through physical contact to other products they touch, thus influencing evaluations.",1
How Disgust Enhances the Effectiveness of Fear Appeals,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The current research explores the role of disgust in enhancing compliance with fear appeals. Despite its frequent use in advertising and prevalence in consumer settings, little is known about the specific role that disgust plays in persuasion. This article explores the unique characteristics of disgust and examines its distinctive effect on persuasion. The results across a series of four studies demonstrate that adding disgust to a fear appeal appreciably enhances message persuasion and compliance beyond that of appeals that elicit only fear. Importantly, the results trace the persuasive effects of disgust to its strong and immediate avoidance reaction.",1
Public Policy and Global Supply Chain Capabilities and Performance: A Resource-Based View,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"In increasingly competitive and global markets, public policy should be customer focused in terms of stressing resources, capabilities, and performance that are most important to the private sector and to other stakeholders. Although this requires a balancing act, it will help ensure successful public/private partnerships, performance outcomes that are customer driven, and planning and policy oversight that is performance based. The authors investigate the relative importance and availability of supply chain capabilities and performance measures for more than 3500 firms in three global regions: North America, Europe, and the Pacific Basin. The authors present additional analyses for best-practice firms that score the highest on an excellence index. The study finds that public policy?enabled customer service or, more broadly, demand-oriented performance capabilities may confer greater competitive advantages than cost- and supply-oriented performance capabilities, though both are important. The study findings have important implications for international public policy, such as trade policies, and for linking policy priorities with private sector requirements for specific capabilities, resources, and performance. The authors discuss additional managerial implications and recommendations for the integration of international marketing and global supply chain strategies with supporting marketing capabilities of standardization, adaptation, or customization and for governmental planning, policy formulation, and data availability.",0
It's the thought (and the Effort) That Counts: How Customizing for others Differs from Customizing for Oneself,Journal of Marketing,2011,"While interest in customization is growing among consumers and academics, researchers have focused on consumers designing products for themselves. Many customization firms, however, are successfully positioning themselves as key sources for unique gifts. In this research, the authors examine whether factors under the firm's control (i.e., the level of design support provided and the presence of a strong brand) are differentially effective when consumers design products for themselves or as gifts for others. Using participants drawn from the relevant target market, they report two studies involving real customization tasks undertaken on fully functioning customization websites. The findings lead to the surprising conclusion that design support is less effective for consumers designing products intended as gifts rather than for themselves, raising expectations without a corresponding rise in evaluations. However, the results offer some good news to firms targeting gift-giving consumers. Both Studies 1 and 2 reveal that gift-givers place a higher value on their own time and effort and thus report a higher willingness to pay than those designing for themselves. This effect is diminished, however, when a strong brand is present and consumers share credit with the brand for the product's design.",0
The Downstream Consequences of Problem-Solving Mindsets: How Playing with LEGO Influences Creativity,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Business leaders, governments, and scholars are increasingly recognizing the importance of creativity. Recent trends in technology and education, however, suggest that many people are facing fewer opportunities to engage in creative thought as they increasingly solve well-defined (vs. ill-defined) problems. Using three studies that involve real problem-solving activities (e.g., putting together a LEGO kit), the authors examine the mindset created by addressing such well-defined problems. The studies demonstrate the negative downstream impact of such a mindset on both creative task performance and tendency to choose to engage in creative tasks. The research has theoretical implications for the creativity and mindset literature streams as well as substantive insights for managers and public policy makers.",1
Entrenched Knowledge Structures and Consumer Response to New Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Although diffusion models have been successfully used to predict the adoption patterns of new products and technologies, little research has examined the psychological processes underlying the individual consumer's adoption decision. This research uses the knowledge transfer paradigm, studied often in the context of analogies, to demonstrate that both existing knowledge and innovation continuity are major factors influencing the consumer's adoption process. In two experiments, the authors demonstrate that the relationship between expertise and adoption is relatively complex. Specifically, their findings indicate that, compared with novices, experts report higher comprehension, more net benefits, and therefore higher preferences for continuous innovations. However, for discontinuous innovations, experts' entrenched knowledge is related to lower comprehension, fewer perceived net benefits, and lower preferences compared with that of novices. Only when this entrenched knowledge is accompanied by relevant information from a supplementary knowledge base are experts able to understand and appreciate discontinuous innovations. These findings have implications for segmentation, media planning, and the creation of product/brand loyalty.",1
Customization in Luxury Brands: Can Valentino Get Personal?,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Luxury brands have started to offer consumers the opportunity to customize their exclusive products by making certain aesthetic decisions, such as the color, fabric, or cut of their products. A robust finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater value on customized than on standard products because these unique products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers? customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands. In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer?s expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers? desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product?s signaling value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take customization too far. Their findings suggest that brand managers should allow consumers to make fewer design decisions for luxury versus mainstream brands to preserve the signal value created by the designer.",1
Evolution of Consumption: A Psychological Ownership Framework,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Technological innovations are creating new products, services, and markets that satisfy enduring consumer needs. These technological innovations create value for consumers and firms in many ways, but they also disrupt psychological ownership??the feeling that a thing is ?MINE.? The authors describe two key dimensions of this technology-driven evolution of consumption pertaining to psychological ownership: (1) replacing legal ownership of private goods with legal access rights to goods and services owned and used by others and (2) replacing ?solid? material goods with ?liquid? experiential goods. They propose that these consumption changes can have three effects on psychological ownership: they can threaten it, cause it to transfer to other targets, and create new opportunities to preserve it. These changes and their effects are organized in a framework and examined across three macro trends in marketing: (1) growth of the sharing economy, (2) digitization of goods and services, and (3) expansion of personal data. This psychological ownership framework generates future research opportunities and actionable marketing strategies for firms aiming to preserve the positive consequences of psychological ownership and navigate cases for which it is a liability.",0
Understanding Firms? Customer Satisfaction Information Usage,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Despite theoretical and empirical research linking a firm's business performance to the satisfaction of its customers, knowledge of how firms collect and use customer satisfaction information is limited. The authors investigate firms? customer satisfaction information usage (CSIU) by drawing on in-depth interviews, a focus group of managers, and the existing literature. They identify key characteristics of the major processes involved in firms? CSIU and compare the CSIU practices revealed in their fieldwork with widely held normative theory prescriptions. They also identify variations in CSIU among the firms in the fieldwork and uncover factors that may help explain the observed differences.",0
Marketing Capabilities in International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"There has been a significant increase in scholarly research focusing on marketing capabilities as an important aspect of marketing theory?based explanations of firm performance. This growing research interest in marketing capabilities has also been reflected in the international marketing literature. However, it is unclear whether and how thinking and research about international marketing capabilities differs from that of marketing capabilities in a domestic market context. To explore this question, the authors conduct a review of studies of marketing capabilities in the most influential journals publishing research in international marketing. They supplement this with insights from interviews with executives in firms engaged to varying degrees in international marketing. The study suggests that there remain numerous important unanswered questions in conceptualizing and empirically researching international marketing capabilities.",0
Antecedents of Export Venture Performance: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Assessment,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms? export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities, competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to structure?conduct?performance theory predictions, the data indicate that the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance. However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages realized.",0
Brand Portfolio Strategy and Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Most large firms operating in consumer markets own and market more than one brand (i.e., they have a brand portfolio). Although firms make corporate-level strategic decisions regarding their brand portfolio, little is known about whether and how a firm's brand portfolio strategy is linked to its business performance. Using data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and other secondary sources, the authors examine the impact of the scope, competition, and positioning characteristics of brand portfolios on the marketing and financial performance of 72 large publicly traded firms operating in consumer markets over ten years (from 1994 to 2003). Controlling for several industry and firm characteristics, the authors analyze the relationship between five specific brand portfolio characteristics (number of brands owned, number of segments in which they are marketed, degree to which the brands in the firm's portfolio compete with one another, and consumer perceptions of the quality and price of the brands in the firm's portfolio) and firms? marketing effectiveness (consumer loyalty and market share), marketing efficiency (ratio of advertising spending to sales and ratio of selling, general, and administrative expenses to sales), and financial performance (Tobin's q, cash flow, and cash flow variability). They find that each of these five brand portfolio characteristics explains significant variance in five or more of the seven aspects of firms? marketing and financial performance examined.",0
Turning Complaining Customers into Loyal Customers: Moderators of the Complaint Handling?Customer Loyalty Relationship,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Firms spend substantial resources responding to customer complaints, and the marketing profession has a long history of supporting that enterprise to promote customer loyalty. The authors question whether this response is always warranted or whether its effectiveness instead depends on economic, industry, customer?firm, product/service, and customer segment factors that may alter the firm?s incentives to compete on complaint management. To consider this question, they integrate economic and marketing theories and investigate factors that influence the complaint recovery?customer loyalty relationship via a sample of 35,597 complaining customers spanning a ten-year period across economic sectors, industries, and firms. Overall, the authors find that the recovery?loyalty relationship is stronger in faster-growing economies, for industries with more competition, for luxury products, and for customers with higher satisfaction and higher expectations of customization. Conversely, the recovery?loyalty relationship is weaker when customers? expectations of product/service reliability are higher, for manufactured goods, and for men compared with women. The authors discuss implications of these results for managers, policy makers, and researchers for more effective management of customer complaints.",0
Cross-National Differences in Consumer Satisfaction: Mobile Services in Emerging and Developed Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"As firms attempt revenue growth through expansion into international markets, research on the potentially differential nature of consumer perceptions across national markets has become increasingly important. The authors advance the customer satisfaction literature by comparing customer perceptions in the wireless services industry across the national markets of Barbados, Singapore, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This five-country context provides a unique opportunity for understanding how customers differ across markets because the data encompass consumers in disparate national markets (e.g., small/large, developing/developed, culturally heterogeneous) but include perceptions regarding a ubiquitous and increasingly commoditized service (wireless services). Focusing on emerging- versus developed-market comparisons, the findings provide important insights into unique differences in customer perceptions, including the greater importance of quality relative to value in influencing satisfaction in developed markets and the lesser importance of satisfaction in influencing customer loyalty in emerging markets.",0
Brand-Specific Leadership: Turning Employees into Brand Champions,Journal of Marketing,2009,"This article reports two studies on how managers can elicit brand-building behavior from frontline employees. Study 1 examines the mechanisms by which brand-specific transactional and transformational leadership influence employees? brand-building behavior. The results from a survey of 269 customer-contact employees show that brand-specific transactional leaders influence followers through a process of compliance, leading to an increase in turnover intentions and a decrease in in-role and extra-role brand-building behaviors. In contrast, brand-specific transformational leaders influence followers through a process of internalization, leading to a decrease in turnover intentions and an increase in in-role and extra-role brand-building behaviors. In turn, both processes are mediated by employees? perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with regard to their work roles as brand representatives. Moreover, the results show that brand-specific transactional leadership moderates the influence of brand-specific transformational leadership in a nonlinear, inverse U-shaped way, so that a medium level of transactional leadership maximizes the positive effects of transformational leadership. Study 2 addresses whether managers can learn brand-specific transformational leadership. A field experiment shows that brand-specific transformational leadership can indeed be learned through management training.",0
Investing for Retirement: The Moderating Effect of Fund Assortment Size on the 1/N Heuristic,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Does the number of funds offered in a defined contribution plan affect how many funds consumers choose to invest in or how they spread dollars across the funds they choose? Across three experiments and the analysis of defined contribution plan data, the authors explore these issues by examining investors' tendency to engage in the 1/n heuristic? that is, allocating their dollars evenly across all available investment options. The authors decompose this heuristic into its two underlying behavioral dimensions: the tendency to invest in all available funds (which they label ?1/n#?) and the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly across chosen funds (which they label ?1/n$?). The authors argue that choosing from larger fund assortments taxes investors' cognitive resources, which leads to more simplified diversification strategies. They find that increasing the fund assortment size decreases the tendency to invest in all available funds (1/n#) but increases the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly among the chosen alternatives (1/n$), provided that the number of funds chosen for investment allows for easy equal dollar allocations. The authors integrate their results with prior research regarding asset choice and allocation heuristics.",1
Does it Make Sense to Use Scents to Enhance Brand Memory?,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Can pleasant ambient scents enhance consumer memory for branded products? If so, why? The authors examine the effects of ambient scent on recall and recognition of brands in two studies. In the first (i.e., encoding) phase of each study, subjects are asked to evaluate familiar and unfamiliar brands while viewing digital photographs of products on a computer screen; stimulus viewing times are measured covertly on the computer. Ambient scent is manipulated in the experiment room through a diffuser. In the second (i.e., retrieval) phase, conducted 24-hours later, brand recall and recognition accuracy are assessed. In both studies, ambient scent improves both recall and recognition of familiar and unfamiliar brands. This pattern emerges whether or not the scent is congruent with the product category (Study 1), and the enhancement in brand memory is due to the presence of ambient scent during encoding rather than retrieval (Study 2). Although ambient scent apparently did not alter subjects' self-assessed mood or arousal levels, it increased their attention in terms of longer stimulus viewing times. Mediation analyses suggest that the attention mechanism most likely explains why ambient scent improves brand memory.",1
Modeling Multichannel Home Video Demand in the U.S. Motion Picture Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The U.S. motion picture industry has become increasingly reliant on posttheatrical channel profits. Two often-cited drivers of these profits are cross-channel substitution among posttheatrical channels and seasonality in consumer preferences for any movie. The authors use a differentiated products version of the multiplicative competitive interaction model to investigate these two phenomena. They estimate the model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in the U.S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies.",1
Behemoths at the Gate: How Incumbents Take on Acquisitive Entrants (and why some do Better than Others),Journal of Marketing,2011,"Corporate acquisitions are a ubiquitous feature of today's business landscape and a widely used means by which large firms enter new markets. As large acquirers swoop in to acquire firms in new markets, they are almost inevitably met with a chorus of concerns about the potential effects of their actions on the markets they enter. What is the actual impact of acquisitive entry by large firms on the strategies and performance of incumbents? How do incumbents reconfigure the way they compete after a behemoth enters their market? The authors focus on an important facet of firms? competitive positions?their product mix?and propose a framework that explains incumbent firms? reaction to acquisitive entry by large firms, as well as the performance implications of these reactions. They test the hypotheses that result from this framework by examining the impact of acquisitive entry across a large number of firms and consumer markets over time: The data cover 839 acquisitions in 583 metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. banking industry. The results indicate that incumbents are more likely to align their product mix strategy with that of the acquisitive entrant if (1) the incumbent is large, (2) the acquirer's past performance has been strong, and (3) the market served by the incumbent is small. Importantly, how incumbents react has significant performance implications: The authors find that large incumbents that deviate from acquirers? product mix strategy perform better than other incumbents do.",0
Building Character: Effects of Lay Theories of Self-Control on the Selection of Products for Children,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research studies the effect of consumers? lay theories of self-control on their choices of products for young children. The authors find that people who hold the implicit assumption that self-control is a small resource that can be increased over time (?limited-malleable theorists?) are more likely to engage in behaviors that may benefit children's self-control. In contrast, people who believe either that self-control is a large resource (?unlimited theorists?) or that it cannot increase over time (?fixed theorists?) are less likely to engage in such behaviors. Field experiments conducted with parents demonstrate that limited-malleable theorists take their children less frequently to fast-food restaurants, give their children unhealthful snacks less often, and prefer educational to entertaining television programs for them. Similar patterns are observed when nonparent adults make gift choices for children or while babysitting. The authors obtain these effects with lay theories both measured and manipulated and after they control for demographic and psychological characteristics, including own self-control. These results contribute to the literature on self-control, parenting, and consumer socialization.",1
An International Marketing Application of Outlier Analysis for Structural Equations: A Methodological Note,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"Structural equation modeling with latent variables is being used more frequently in international marketing research. However, the authors argue that it is hazardous to conduct cross-national marketing research without evaluating the potential influential effects of multivariate outliers, which are observations distinct from the majority of cases. Because the presence of outliers in the data can significantly bias a study's findings, this is an important issue in international research. To improve upon current practice, the authors recommend using a two-step approach for detecting and analyzing multivariate outliers in structural equation models. The first step is to detect outliers using three techniques: Bollen's aii(1987), Mahalanobis Distance, and the Observed Covariance Ratio, a new technique developed by the authors. The second step is to determine whether outliers unduly influence study findings. This is accomplished by estimating statistical models with and without outliers and comparing results. The authors demonstrate the two-step approach using data from a previous international marketing study. Several outliers were found to influence model fit, R2, and the size and direction of parameter estimates. The study highlights the importance of multivariate outlier analysis to international researchers.",0
Gamified Information Presentation and Consumer Adoption of Product Innovations,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This research examines the effect of gamified information presentation?conveying information about a product innovation in the form of a game?on consumer adoption of that innovation. The key hypothesis is that gamified information presentation promotes consumer innovation adoption and that it does so through two parallel psychological processes?by increasing consumer playfulness, which stimulates curiosity about the innovation, and by enhancing the perceived vividness of information presentation, which increases the perceived advantage of the innovation relative to (less innovative) competing products. Evidence from seven studies, including two field experiments, supports this theorizing. The results also show that for gamified information presentation to increase innovation adoption, it is essential that the information is integrated into the game. These findings advance the understanding of the psychological forces that govern how consumers respond to receiving product information in the form of games, and they have important practical implications for how firms might use gamified information presentation to promote sales of new products.",0
Know Your Customer: How Salesperson Perceptions of Customer Relationship Quality Form and Influence Account Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Firms often utilize salesperson intelligence in marketing strategies to improve sales performance. However, this approach is problematic if the information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from salesperson?customer dyads and secondary performance data reveal several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more from salesperson accuracy in high- and low-quality relationships (i.e., a U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases. Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson perceptions and how to manage them.",0
The Influence of Time-Interval Descriptions on Goal-Pursuit Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Consumers pursue numerous goals that are linked to particular time frames. Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by duration (e.g., ?within exactly two weeks from now?) instead of date (e.g., ?between today and November 17?). This pattern may arise because dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in achieving their goals.",1
The Sting of Social: How Emphasizing Social Consequences in Warning Messages Influences Perceptions of Risk,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This research examines the effects of warning messages that emphasize the social consequences of negative health outcomes. The authors demonstrate that highlighting social (vs. health) consequences leads to greater perceived temporal proximity of and increased perceived vulnerability to the outcome, thereby affecting risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and customer perceptions of actual experience. They document this effect across five studies in different health domains including flossing (Study 1), soda consumption (Study 2), smoking (Study 3), and unprotected ultraviolet light exposure (Studies 4 and 5). These findings point to the important role of the consequence type highlighted in warning messages, which can have a significant impact on risk perceptions and consumer experiences.",0
Strategic Alliance?Based Global Sourcing Strategy for Competitive Advantage: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"In an era of intense global competition, firms realize that the effective use of global sourcing contributes significantly to their market performance. Increasingly, successful firms use a higher level of strategic alliance?based global sourcing for major components by cooperating with their suppliers, even when highly specific assets are involved. This phenomenon is contradictory to the recommendation of transaction cost analysis, in which global internal sourcing should be used by firms when asset specificity is involved. Through the integration of different perspectives, the author examines variables that may influence buyer firms to rely more on strategic alliance?based global sourcing for major components when highly specific assets are involved. In addition, the author suggests that strategic alliance?based global sourcing when highly specific assets are deployed may enhance a firm's competitive advantage through the combination of resources in unique ways. This article is intended to increase managers' awareness of the strategic benefits that arise from outsourcing through partnerships with their suppliers.",0
A Cross-Team Framework of International Knowledge Acquisition on New Product Development Capabilities and New Product Market Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Rapid new product developments (NPDs) have drastically changed the competitive landscape in the global economy. Because the time-to-market dimension of product introduction has become a crucial determinant of multinational corporations? (MNCs?) competitive advantage, the ability of MNCs to exploit their knowledge globally across subsidiaries using cross-teams has become an important source of competitive advantage. Recognizing the crucial role of MNCs? knowledge management in NPD, the authors develop a conceptual framework to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of international knowledge acquisition at the cross-team level. The framework suggests that though it is important to acquire necessary knowledge resources for NPD, managers must nurture an NPD project team's realized absorptive capacity to transform the acquired knowledge resources into NPD capabilities, which in turn affect new product market performance.",0
Assessing Measurement Invariance of Export Market Orientation: A Study of Chinese and Non-Chinese Firms in China,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"In response to numerous calls for the cross-cultural validation of measures used in international research, the authors assess measurement invariance of the export market orientation (EMO) and export performance (EP) constructs using 491 Chinese and non-Chinese export ventures in China. The results show that both the EMO and the EP scales are invariant between Chinese and non-Chinese export ventures. In addition, different EMO components have differential effects on EP for Chinese versus non-Chinese firms. To achieve higher EP, Chinese firms should focus on export intelligence responsiveness, and non-Chinese firms should concentrate their efforts on export intelligence generation. The authors discuss implications and suggest directions for further research.",0
Foreign Market Entry Timing Revisited: Trade-Off between Market Share Performance and Firm Survival,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"This study revisits the impact of entry timing on the performance of foreign-invested firms. The authors posit that balancing between market share performance and firm survival is critical for foreign firms to capitalize on early-mover advantages. Using a longitudinal data set of 25,513 foreign firms operating in China, the authors find that early entrants enjoy higher market shares but suffer from lower survival rates than late entrants. In addition, foreign firms? entry mode and investment size affect their market shares and survival. The results also provide supporting evidence of the interaction effects among entry timing, entry mode, and investment size on foreign firms? market shares and survival.",0
Global Sourcing Strategy and Performance of Knowledge-Intensive Business Services: A Two-Stage Strategic Fit Model,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"This research contributes to the understanding of global sourcing strategy of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBSs) by offering an explanation for the differential performance among firms, even when they use similar global sourcing strategies. Using a systems integrator as the sourcing firm's perspective, the authors argue that complex KIBSs involve a complicated mixture of interfaces in that the performance of an individual KIBS is insufficient in defining the overall performance of the integrated KIBS system. The theoretical framework uses a two-stage strategic fit model that emphasizes the conditions under which global sourcing of KIBSs influences performance. Firms that strategically coalign sourcing strategy with KIBS attributes for each KIBS activity should perform more effectively than firms that lack such a coalignment. After selecting an appropriate sourcing strategy, the firm's dynamic capabilities (i.e., absorptive capacity and integration capability) may accentuate or attenuate the performance of the strategy at the integrated KIBS system level. Thus, although managers may be tempted to source KIBSs globally to reduce labor costs, they must examine both the KIBS attributes and the firm's dynamic capabilities.",0
Who's Got the Coupon? Estimating Consumer Preferences and Coupon Usage from Aggregate Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Most researchers in marketing have typically relied on disaggregate data (e.g., consumer panels) to estimate the behavioral and managerial implications of coupon promotions. In this article, the authors propose the use of individual-level Bayesian methods for studying this problem when only aggregate data on consumer choices (market share) and coupon usage (number of distributed coupons and/or number of redeemed coupons) are available. The methodology is based on augmenting the aggregate data with unobserved (simulated) sequences of choices and coupon usage consistent with the aggregate data. The authors analyze various marketing scenarios that differ in terms of their assumptions about consumer choices, coupon availability, and coupon redemption. They illustrate the proposed methods using both simulated data and a real data set for which an extensive set of posterior predictive checks helps validate the aggregate-level estimation. In addition, the authors relate the empirical results to some of the findings in the literature about the coordination of coupon promotions and pricing and show how the methodology can be used to evaluate alternative coupon targeting policies.",1
Just Give Me Another Chance: The Strategies for Brand Recovery from a Bad First Impression,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Firms sometimes create negative initial impressions on potential customers and then face the problem of determining how to change these initial impressions. The marketing literature offers little guidance on how to do this, and the psychology literature suggests that negative initial impressions are much more resistant to change than positive initial impressions. The authors contrast the efficacy of comparative and noncomparative new information about a target brand when the initial impression of the brand is positive or negative. A body of extant research shows that positive initial impressions change more in the face of comparative information than when the same information is noncomparative and does not mention a competitor. The authors replicate this effect for positive initial impressions but deduce and show that the opposite is true for negative initial impressions. Thus, the authors show that when evaluations are memory based rather than stimulus based and when the initial evaluation is negative, new information that is noncomparative leads to a greater change in consumer attitudes. The authors discuss the implications of this finding for firms that are attempting to recover from negative initial impressions.",1
Academic Insights: An Application of Multiple-Group Causal Models in Assessing Cross-Cultural Measurement Equivalence,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"In cross-national marketing research, the question whether measurement accuracy, reliability, and validity are achieved across samples traditionally has hampered research efforts. Measurement equivalence across samples has particularly perplexed researchers in their efforts to evaluate responses regarding latent variables. Recently, multiple-group structural equations modeling has been suggested as a reliable method for determining measurement equivalence. To date, however, the use of this approach has remained limited. In this study, the authors apply multiple-group structural equations modeling to assess measurement equivalence in three distinct constructs across U.S. and Korean samples on data derived from cross-cultural advertising research. The authors propose an extension of this method using the measurement error covariance matrices, which will enable researchers to evaluate measurement reliability across samples better and to attempt to disentangle cultural differences in instrument usage from measurement-related differences. The authors evaluate the results and discuss the findings, as well as outline the implications and limitations of this method for further research.",0
The Value of Pricing Control in Export Channels: A Governance Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"In this article, the authors expand traditional channel control models to investigate the value of absorbing pricing decisions within an exporter's decision-making domain. From a governance perspective, pricing control is considered a structured continuum driven by factors both internal and external to the firm. More specifically, the authors investigate the organizational and environmental influences driving pricing control decisions and the impact of pricing control on both the economic and strategic performance of the firm. Using linear and moderated regression analysis, the authors find that both the strategic perspectives and the organizational characteristics of exporters significantly influence pricing control, yet in ways counterintuitive to traditional thinking. Similarly, the performance implications add new insight to the value of pricing control in dynamic overseas environments. The authors discuss managerial and research implications.",0
A New Dimension Reduction Approach for Data-Rich Marketing Environments: Sliced Inverse Regression,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In data-rich marketing environments (e.g., direct marketing or new product design), managers face an ever-growing need to reduce the number of variables effectively. To accomplish this goal, the authors introduce a new method called sliced inverse regression (SIR), which finds factors by taking into account the information contained in both the dependent and independent variables. Sliced inverse regression objectively identifies appropriate factors through simple statistical tests for determining the number of factors to retain and for assessing the significance of factor-loading coefficients. The authors make conceptual connections between SIR and several existing approaches, including principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Using Monte Carlo experiments, the authors demonstrate that SIR performs better than these approaches. Two empirical examples?designing a new executive business program and direct marketing by a catalog company?are presented to illustrate the application of SIR and to show that it outperforms both PLSR and PCR in these cases. In addition, the authors discuss how direct marketers can apply SIR to analyze large databases and to thus target customers effectively. In conclusion, SIR is a promising methodology in data-intensive marketing environments.",1
Understanding the Impact of Synergy in Multimedia Communications,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Many advertisers adopt the integrated marketing communications perspective that emphasizes the importance of synergy in planning multimedia activities. However, the role of synergy in multimedia communications is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how advertisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multimedia communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive theoretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspending. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research.",1
Controlling Measurement Errors in Models of Advertising Competition,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Commercial market research firms provide information on advertising variables of interest, such as brand awareness or gross rating points, that are likely to contain measurement errors. This unreliability of measured variables induces bias in the estimated parameters of dynamic models of advertising. Consequently, advertisers either under- or overspend on advertising to maintain a desired level of brand awareness. Monte Carlo studies show that the magnitude of bias can be serious when conventional estimation methods, such as ordinary least squares and errors in variables, are employed to obtain parameter estimates. Therefore, the authors have developed two new approaches that either reduce or eliminate parameter bias. Using these methods, advertisers can determine an unbiased optimal advertising budget, even if advertising variables are measured with error. The application of these methods to estimate the extent of measurement noise in empirical advertising data is illustrated.",1
Asymmetric Social Interactions in Physician Prescription Behavior: The Role of Opinion Leaders,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors quantify the impact of social interactions and peer effects in the context of physicians? prescription choices. Using detailed individual-level prescription data, along with self-reported social network information, the authors document that physician prescription behavior is significantly influenced by the behavior of research-active specialists, or ?opinion leaders,? in the physician's reference group. The authors leverage a natural experiment in the category: New guidelines released about the therapeutic nature of the focal drug generated conditions in which physicians were more likely to be influenced by the behavior of specialist physicians in their network. The authors (1) find important, statistically significant peer effects that are robust across model specifications; (2) document asymmetries in response to marketing activity across nominators and opinion leaders; (3) measure the incremental value to firms of directing targeted sales force activity to these opinion leaders; and (4) present estimates of the social multiplier of detailing in this category.",1
Subsidiary Knowledge Development in Knowledge-Intensive Business Services: A Configuration Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"The international marketing literature has suggested that the characteristics of the subsidiary?headquarters relationship play an important role in subsidiary knowledge development within the field of multinational corporations. However, few studies have examined the association between the subsidiary?headquarters relationship and the subsidiary strategic role and its effects on subsidiary knowledge development. In this article, the authors first examine the effect of four subsidiary?headquarters relational characteristics (socialization mechanisms, autonomy, shared values, and internal embeddedness) on subsidiary knowledge development. Then, building on configuration theory, the authors employ two perspectives of fit (moderation and profile deviation) to investigate the impact of fit between strategy and relational characteristics and examine their effects on subsidiary knowledge development. Using data from 184 U.K. foreign-owned subsidiaries operating in the knowledge-intensive business services sector, the authors confirm that internal embeddedness, socialization mechanisms, and autonomy are positively related to subsidiary knowledge development. Furthermore, the findings support the moderation and profile deviation perspectives and indicate that aligning the subsidiary's strategic role with relational characteristics can lead to superior knowledge development.",0
Harvesting Brand Information from Social Tags,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Social tags are user-defined keywords associated with online content that reflect consumers? perceptions of various objects, including products and brands. This research presents a new approach for harvesting rich, qualitative information on brands from user-generated social tags. The authors first compare their proposed approach with conventional techniques such as brand concept maps and text mining. They highlight the added value of their approach that results from the unconstrained, open-ended, and synoptic nature of consumer-generated content contained within social tags. The authors then apply existing text-mining and data-reduction methods to analyze disaggregate-level social tagging data for marketing research and demonstrate how marketers can utilize the information in social tags by extracting key representative topics, monitoring common dynamic trends, and understanding heterogeneous perceptions of a brand.",0
The Informational Value of Social Tagging Networks,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Social tagging is a new way to share and categorize online content that enables users to express their thoughts, perceptions, and feelings with respect to diverse concepts. In social tagging, content is connected through user-generated keywords??tags??and is readily searchable through these tags. The rich associative information that social tagging provides marketers new opportunities to infer brand associative networks. This article investigates how the information contained in social tags can act as a proxy measure for brand performance and can predict the financial valuation of a firm. Using data collected from a social tagging and bookmarking website, Delicious, the authors examine social tagging data for 44 firms across 14 markets. After controlling for accounting metrics, media citations, and other user-generated content, they find that social tag?based brand management metrics capturing brand familiarity, favorability of associations, and competitive overlaps of brand associations can explain unanticipated stock returns. In addition, they find that in managing brand equity, it is more important for strong brands to enhance category dominance, whereas it is more critical for weak brands to enhance connectedness. These findings suggest a new way for practitioners to track, measure, and manage intangible brand equity; proactively improve brand performance; and influence a firm's financial performance.",0
Digital Environment in Global Markets: Cross-Cultural Implications for Evolving Customer Journeys,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Digital technologies and digital media are changing the environments in which firms interact with customers. However, the evolution of digital organizational forms, customer technology use, and the nature of customer journeys differ significantly across global markets. Drawing on observations of customer journeys across different international markets, the authors propose a framework to explain the observed differences in terms of the cross-cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence customer journeys. The authors put forth several propositions built on logical extensions of the extant research findings and identify areas for future academic research. In addition, they outline the managerial implications arising from the application of the framework for multinational firms seeking to market their products and services across global markets.",0
Return on Investment Implications for Pharmaceutical Promotional Expenditures: The Role of Marketing-Mix Interactions,Journal of Marketing,2004,"The authors empirically explore the revenue impact of marketing-mix variables and their interactions. The findings include the following: pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising and detailing (sales force) affect demand synergistically, detailing raises price elasticity, and detailing has a higher return on investment than does direct-to-consumer advertising. The authors also discuss other implications and provide future research directions.",0
Temporal Differences in the Role of Marketing Communication in New Product Categories,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors investigate the changing role of marketing communication over the life cycle of a new product category. They postulate two effects of marketing communication on consumers' choices: an ?indirect effect? through reduction of uncertainty about product quality and a ?direct effect? (i.e., more is better). The authors expect that the indirect effect is relatively larger in the early, postlaunch stages. They develop a structural model of demand that allows for such temporal differences in the roles of marketing communication. They use a random coefficients discrete choice model with a Bayesian learning process to model physician learning about new drugs and market-level data for the prescription antihistamines category. They find that marketing communication has a primarily indirect effect 6?14 months after introduction but that the direct effect subsequently dominates. The results suggest that firms should follow a pattern of heavier communication at the introduction phase followed by lower levels.",1
Estimating Causal Installed-Base Effects: A Bias-Correction Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"New empirical models of consumer demand that incorporate social effects seek to measure the causal effect of past adopter's behavior?the ?installed-base??on current adoption behavior. Identifying such causal effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect. The authors also discuss implications of the results for identification of models in marketing involving state dependence in demand, and incorporating discrete games of strategic interaction.",1
Building and Sustaining Buyer?Seller Relationships in Mature Industrial Markets,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Empirical research in relationship management has tended to take a snapshot of a relationship at a given time and attempt to project its trajectory, despite agreement among researchers that a longitudinal perspective focused on process models advances the implications for practice. The authors use a field investigative approach to study, over time, the evolution of three industrial buyer?seller relationships in mature industrial markets. The relationships are characterized by various degrees of initial asymmetry and have evolved in dramatically different ways over time. Their findings suggest that weaker firms can structure and thrive in long-term relationships with powerful partners because initial asymmetries are subsequently redressed through the development of high levels of interpersonal trust across the dyad, which in turn leads to increased levels of interorganizational commitment.",0
A Study of the Internationalization?Performance Relationship in Global Retailing: The Moderating Role of Brand Standardization and Cultural Diversity,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"While the internationalization?performance relationship has been extensively studied in the international business literature, it has only recently begun to be systematically and empirically explored in the retailing context, albeit with mixed findings. This study extends this emerging stream of research on retail internationalization by investigating the moderating role of brand standardization, or the extent to which retailers standardize their domestic store-as-a-brand across foreign markets, using longitudinal data from global retailers. The authors demonstrate that the internationalization?performance relationship is positive and curvilinear for retailers, and it is positively moderated by brand standardization. In particular, brand standardization offers benefits at low and high levels of internationalization, which suggests a learning curve with respect to global brand management as retailers internationalize. The study also finds that cultural diversity in retailers? foreign markets acts as a boundary condition by weakening this moderating effect of brand standardization. This research contributes to firm internationalization, standardization?adaptation, and global brand management literature streams, with implications for global retailers.",0
Chief Marketing Officers: A Study of Their Presence in Firms'Top Management Teams,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Not all firms choose to have a chief marketing officer (CMO) in their top management teams (TMTs). This research investigates factors associated with this choice and whether CMO presence/absence in the face of these factors affects firm performance. Findings based on a multi-industry sample of 167 firms over a five-year period (2000?2004) show that innovation, differentiation, branding strategy, diversification, TMT functional experience in marketing, and the chief executive officer being an outsider are associated with the likelihood of CMO presence in the TMT. Furthermore, the authors find that CMO presence in the TMT has neither a positive nor a negative impact on firm performance. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice.",0
Marketing in the C-Suite: A Study of Chief Marketing Officer Power in Firms? Top Management Teams,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Some chief marketing officers (CMOs) are more powerful than others. The authors investigate the drivers and outcomes of this phenomenon using a hierarchical measure of power for the CMO in the top management team (TMT), or corporate executive suite (C-suite). Theory suggests that CMO power in the TMT should increase with (1) the CMO's control over resources required by other executives in the C-suite, (2) the criticality and (3) effective provision of these resources, and (4) the nonsubstitutability and (5) centrality of the CMO. The authors use these rationales to identify factors that affect CMO power in public U.S. firms with the CMO position for at least two of the five observed years. The findings show that CMO power increases when the CMO has the additional responsibility of sales, as TMT marketing experience decreases, and as firms with low levels of TMT marketing experience pursue innovation. Furthermore, CMO power in highly divisionalized TMTs and the CMO's additional responsibility of sales improve sales growth, but CMO power in firms that are unrelated diversifiers reduces profitability. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results for marketing's influence in the C-suite and the firm, the integration of marketing and sales, and market orientation.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of Firms? Export Commitment: An Empirical Study,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Theory posits that export commitment is key to the effective implementation of resource-led strategy. The authors investigate the role of export commitment, considered a multidimensional construct, in linking export resources and capabilities to positional advantages achieved in foreign markets. They test their resource-based view assertions among a multi-industry sample of 150 Spanish exporters. The results show that experiential resources, specific export capabilities, and export market orientation (EMO) reinforce export commitment, which exerts a positive effect on perceived positional advantages. These perceptions also are likely to be positive if the firm adapts its marketing mix to the needs of its foreign markets. Moreover, the results show that EMO exerts a positive influence on marketing-mix adaptation. Resources linked to experience and informational knowledge about foreign markets foster the development of capabilities (i.e., specific export capabilities and/or EMO). Finally, the results indicate that specific export capabilities influence EMO. The authors conclude with a discussion of practical implications for facilitating export competitive strategy and success.",0
Minimum Required Payment and Supplemental Information Disclosure Effects on Consumer Debt Repayment Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Repayment decisions?how much of the loan to repay and when to make the payments?directly influence consumer debt levels. The authors examine how minimum required payment policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that while presenting minimum required payment information has a negative impact on repayment decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U.S. consumers shows that consumers? propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U.K. credit card field data indicate that borrowers? credit limit and balance due also moderate these effects. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments. This research offers new insights into the debt repayment process and has implications for consumers, lenders, and public policy.",1
"Seeing Ourselves in Others: Reviewer Ambiguity, Egocentric Anchoring, and Persuasion",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Consumers increasingly inform one another about marketplace offerings in online review forums. The authors demonstrate that when given no information about a reviewer (i.e., when the reviewer's identity is ambiguous), consumers use an accessibility-based egocentric anchor to infer that ambiguous reviewers have similar tastes to their own, leading consumers to be (1) similarly persuaded by reviews written by ambiguous and similar reviewers and (2) more persuaded by reviews written by ambiguous reviewers than by reviews written by dissimilar reviewers. The authors demonstrate that this effect holds in a single-offering, single-reviewer context. The authors also show that when consumers are exposed to multiple offerings with multiple reviewers, there may be a slight ?cost? to ambiguity as opposed to similarity but that ambiguity remains much more persuasive than dissimilarity. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the effects of egocentric anchoring on persuasion can be moderated, first, by making other-related thoughts accessible and, second, by providing external cues about potential reviewer heterogeneity. These findings have important implications for both the management and monitoring of consumer-to-consumer online communication.",1
Beyond the ?Like? Button: The Impact of Mere Virtual Presence on Brand Evaluations and Purchase Intentions in Social Media Settings,Journal of Marketing,2012,"By 2011, approximately 83% of Fortune 500 companies were using some form of social media to connect with consumers. Furthermore, surveys suggest that consumers are increasingly relying on social media to learn about unfamiliar brands. However, best practices regarding the use of social media to bolster brand evaluations in such situations remain undefined. This research focuses on one practice in this domain: the decision to hide or reveal the demographic characteristics of a brand's online supporters. The results from four studies indicate that even when the presence of these supporters is only passively experienced and virtual (a situation the authors term ?mere virtual presence?), their demographic characteristics can influence a target consumer's brand evaluations and purchase intentions. The findings suggest a framework for brand managers to use when deciding whether to reveal the identities of their online supporters or to retain ambiguity according to (1) the composition of existing supporters relative to targeted new supporters and (2) whether the brand is likely to be evaluated singly or in combination with competing brands.",0
Interrupted Consumption: Disrupting Adaptation to Hedonic Experiences,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Six studies demonstrate that interrupting a consumption experience can make pleasant experiences more enjoyable and unpleasant experiences more irritating, even though consumers avoid breaks in pleasant experiences and choose breaks in unpleasant experiences. Across a variety of hedonic experiences (e.g., listening to noises or songs, sitting in a massage chair), the authors observe that breaks disrupt hedonic adaptation and, as a result, intensify the subsequent experience.",1
On Southbound Ease and Northbound Fees: Literal Consequences of the Metaphoric Link between Vertical Position and Cardinal Direction,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Consumers are influenced by the metaphoric relationship between cardinal direction and vertical position (i.e., ?north is up?). People believe that it will take longer to travel north than south (Study 1), that it will cost more to ship to a northern than to a southern location (Studies 2 and 6), and that a moving company will charge more (Studies 3a and 3b) for northward than for southward movement. Furthermore, people have greater intention to visit stores advertised to be south (versus north) of a reference point (Study 4), especially when ease of travel is important (Study 5).",1
Does Improvisation Help or Hinder Planning in Determining Export Success? Decision Theory Applied to Exporting,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Exporting enables organizations to diversify risk and generate multiple income streams. In turn, the ability to make good export decisions is purported to be a main determinant of performance. Although substantive export decisions are well researched, little is known about how export decisions should be made in practice and whether different decision-making approaches should be combined. This study addresses this gap using decision theory; the authors assess the interaction of planning and improvisation and examine the impact of these approaches on export responsiveness and export performance. They develop a conceptual model through exploratory research and test it through structural equation modeling. The authors seek insights into the results through post hoc in-depth interviews and conclude that improvisation has multiple dimensions (spontaneity, creativity, and action orientation) and that there is no one ?best way? for export managers to make decisions. Furthermore, export planning can enhance economic performance but detract from customer performance. In addition, improvisation improves responsiveness, whereas action orientation leads to greater customer performance and results in greater responsiveness with regard to planning. However, export managers should be wary of spontaneity and creativity, because they detract from planning outcomes.",0
The Impact of Outcome Elaboration on Susceptibility to Contextual and Presentation Biases,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors examine an important anomaly in investment behavior?namely, the tendency to fall prey to the effects of contextual and presentation biases, which emerge when people make different decisions as a function of how information is presented to them. They also identify an important factor that moderates these effects. The results from four studies show that investors with a stronger tendency to engage in predecision outcome elaboration are less susceptible to various contextual and presentation biases and are more likely to make consistent investment choices. Furthermore, the authors find that encouraging predecision elaboration on both the potential benefits and the potential risks of investing helps investors who tend not to engage in such elaboration become less influenced by peripheral cues, such as information framing and presentation mode. The findings offer implications for decision research and for the design, presentation, and communication of financial products.",1
Defection Detection: Measuring and Understanding the Predictive Accuracy of Customer Churn Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This article provides a descriptive analysis of how methodological factors contribute to the accuracy of customer churn predictive models. The study is based on a tournament in which both academics and practitioners downloaded data from a publicly available Web site, estimated a model, and made predictions on two validation databases. The results suggest several important findings. First, methods do matter. The differences observed in predictive accuracy across submissions could change the profitability of a churn management campaign by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Second, models have staying power. They suffer very little decrease in performance if they are used to predict churn for a database compiled three months after the calibration data. Third, researchers use a variety of modeling ?approaches,? characterized by variables such as estimation technique, variable selection procedure, number of variables included, and time allocated to steps in the model-building process. The authors find important differences in performance among these approaches and discuss implications for both researchers and practitioners.",1
"Conflicts in the Work?Family Interface: Links to Job Stress, Customer Service Employee Performance, and Customer Purchase Intent",Journal of Marketing,2005,"Because customer service employees often represent the sole contact a customer has with a firm, it is important to examine job-related factors that affect customer service employee performance and customer evaluations. In two diverse customer settings, the authors capture matched responses from service employees, supervisors, and customers. The authors use the data to examine the potential chain of effects from customer service employee work?family conflict and family?work conflict, to job stress and job performance, to customer purchase intent (CPI). The results show direct (and indirect) effects of work?family conflict and family?work conflict on service employee customer-directed extra-role performance (CDERP). The results also show direct effects of job stress on service employee in-role performance (IRP) and CDERP and on CPI. Furthermore, the findings show that job stress has a more pronounced effect on IRP than on CDERP and that CDERP has a greater effect on CPI than does IRP. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial and theoretical implications.",0
When Words Sweat: Identifying Signals for Loan Default in the Text of Loan Applications,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"The authors present empirical evidence that borrowers, consciously or not, leave traces of their intentions, circumstances, and personality traits in the text they write when applying for a loan. This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower?s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.",1
Adaptive Self-Explication of Multiattribute Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors propose a Web-based adaptive self-explicated approach for multiattribute preference measurement (conjoint analysis) with a large number (ten or more) of attributes. The proposed approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous self-explicated approaches. The authors develop a computer-based self-explicated approach that breaks down the attribute importance question into a ranking of attributes followed by a sequence of constant-sum paired comparison questions. In the proposed approach, the questions are chosen adaptively for each respondent to maximize the information elicited from each paired comparison question. Unlike the traditional self-explicated approach, the proposed approach provides standard errors for attribute importance. In two studies involving digital cameras and laptop computers described on 12 and 14 attributes, respectively, the authors find that the ability to correctly predict validation choices of the proposed adaptive approach is substantially and significantly greater than that of adaptive conjoint analysis, the fast polyhedral method, and the traditional self-explicated approach. In addition, the adaptive self-explicated approach yields a significantly higher predictive validity than a nonadaptive fractional factorial constant-sum paired comparison design.",1
"How Should Firms Manage Excessive Product Use? A Continuous-Time Demand Model to Test Reward Schedules, Notifications, and Time Limits",Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Several industries have recently been criticized by parents, think tanks, and governments for creating product environments that lead to excessive screen usage. If firms do not properly manage product usage, demand may drop, and public policy makers may intervene. The authors of this study test alternative ways to manage the use of such products: redesigning the timing of rewards, introducing notifications to users, and imposing time limits. A continuous-time demand model is proposed and empirically estimated with high-frequency data. The methodology is flexible enough to simultaneously explain multiple usage decisions that happen in quick succession, such as when to start and stop usage and how to respond to rewards or messages from the firm. The approach is implemented on a data set from the online gaming industry that includes usage decisions of a large sample of individuals. The authors find that improving reward schedules and imposing time limits leads to shorter usage sessions and longer product subscriptions?a win-win outcome. Notifications are found not to be useful to manage product usage.",1
Authenticity is Contagious: Brand Essence and the Original Source of Production,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"It is well established that differences in manufacturing location can affect consumer preferences through lay inferences about production quality. In this article, the authors take a different approach to this topic by demonstrating how beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special aura or ?essence? from their past) influence perceptions of authenticity for everyday consumer products and brands. Specifically, they find that due to a belief in contagion, products from a company's original manufacturing location are viewed as containing the essence of the brand. In turn, this belief in transferred essence leads consumers to view products from the original factory as more authentic and valuable than identical products made elsewhere. The authors further reveal that consumers who are higher in sensitivity to contagion are more likely to exhibit this effect and that activating the concept of contagion enhances preferences for products made in the brand's original factory. The authors close by discussing theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",1
Uncertainty Evokes Consumers? Preference for Brands Incongruent with their Global?Local Citizenship Identity,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research demonstrates that under states of certainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer global (local) brands, whereas under states of uncertainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer local (global) brands. This effect occurs because uncertainty (certainty) activates a divergent (convergent) thinking style, which results in a preference for options that are more distant from (closer to) the identity to which consumers associate more strongly. The effect holds both when individuals? global?local citizenship identity is measured and when it is manipulated. The research further establishes an important boundary condition for the effect. The effect holds in the citizenship identity context because people normally associate themselves with both local and global citizenship identities, and situational or dispositional factors only influence the degree to which they associate with each identity. The effect does not surface when individuals construe their local?global citizenship identities as interfering, meaning they conceive that holding one identity conflicts with holding the other.",1
Field Dependency and Brand Cognitive Structures,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This research examines the impact of field dependency on the way people structure brand information in memory. The authors propose that a person's level of field dependency is an important determinant of the way information is stored in memory. Specifically, the authors argue that field independents are more likely to extract and integrate episodic information to form overall brand beliefs, while field dependents tend to store more detailed, episodic information in memory and are less likely to generalize information across product categories. The authors further propose that this effect is moderated by level of expertise and that such differences have important implications for how people evaluate marketing communications. The results from five studies support their propositions.",1
The Knowledge-Creating Role of the Internet in International Business: Evidence from Vietnam,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"This article examines the knowledge-creating role of the Internet in international business activities of Vietnamese firms. The authors find that both the collection and the transformation of information from the Internet by a firm affect its foreign sales intensity. In addition, market and learning orientations facilitate this process.",0
The Impact of Increasing Search Frictions on Online Shopping Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Many online stores are designed such that shoppers can easily access any available discounted products. The authors propose that deliberately increasing search frictions by placing obstacles to locating discounted items can improve online retailers? margins and even increase conversion. The authors demonstrate this using a simple theoretical framework that suggests inducing consumers to inspect higher-priced items first may simultaneously increase the average price of items sold and the overall expected purchase probability by inducing consumers to search more products. The authors test and confirm these predictions in a series of field experiments conducted with a dominant online fashion and apparel retailer. Furthermore, using information in historical transaction data about each consumer, the authors demonstrate that price-sensitive shoppers are more likely to willingly incur search costs when locating discounted items. Our results show that increasing search frictions can be used as a self-selecting price discrimination tool to match high discounts with price-sensitive consumers and full-priced offerings with price-insensitive consumers.",1
Specifying Price Judgments with Range?Frequency Theory in Models of Brand Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"To construct a price judgment, consumers compare a focal price with one or more reference prices. However, reference price operationalizations in the brand choice literature use single-point summary measures that cannot account for several distributional effects. To account for effects beyond the first moment of the reference price distribution, the authors specify price judgments in models of brand choice in accordance with range?frequency theory. The findings indicate that range?frequency price judgments provide a more complete specification of reference price effects and become more important with an increase in the second and third moments of a reference price distribution. The data also indicate that range effects are stronger for coupon users and frequency effects are stronger for consumers exposed to a trend of prices. The results have several implications for choice modeling, pricing theory, and pricing strategy.",1
Emotionality and Semantic Onsets: Exploring Orienting Attention Responses in Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Prior research on attention shifts to advertisements has focused primarily on demonstrating how perceptual features can shift attention to advertisements. In this article, the authors demonstrate that certain semantic characteristics of nonfocal advertising elements may similarly attract attention when consumers are focused on a primary task elsewhere in the visual field. In three experiments, the authors investigate how orienting attention responses to highly emotional advertising elements influence ad and brand awareness in cluttered environments. Specifically, they demonstrate that preattentive processing of the semantic information in nonfocal ad headlines can elicit orienting attention responses that result in predictable increases in ad and brand awareness.",1
"Consumer World-Mindedness, Social-Mindedness, and Store Image",Journal of International Marketing,2008,"As advances in communications technology shrink the impact of geographic distance, consumers are likely to become more aware of and familiar with products and services in other parts of the world, as well as global social and ethical issues. Retailers have responded to these trends (termed here ?consumer world-mindedness? and ?consumer social-mindedness?) by adapting their positioning and product assortment. The authors develop measures of consumer world-mindedness and social-mindedness and examine their relationship to exposure to other cultures and store image using a survey of 191 consumers in the Netherlands. The authors examine images of three types of stores: the Body Shop, fair-trade stores, and a grocery store with an imported food products section. The results confirm that consumers? exposure to foreign cultures increases consumer world-mindedness and social-mindedness and that both have a significant impact on store image. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for retail and international marketing management.",0
Consumer World-Mindedness and Attitudes toward Product Positioning in Advertising: An Examination of Global versus Foreign versus Local Positioning,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"In recent years, increasing interest has emerged in examining global consumer culture and its impact on consumer product preferences and choices, lifestyles, and exposure to mass media from other countries. In turn, this has sparked interest in concepts such as consumer world-mindedness and its impact on attitudes and behavior. The current research examines differences in consumer response to advertisements reflecting a global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) versus a foreign consumer culture positioning (FCCP) or a local consumer culture positioning (LCCP) and the relationship with consumer world-mindedness. In Studies 1 and 2, the authors examine the impact of world-mindedness, while controlling for ethnocentric attitudes. In Study 3, they examine the interactions of world-mindedness, international travel, and preference for authenticity. The authors develop several hypotheses and examine them using two surveys of 90 (Study 1) and 100 consumers (Studies 2 and 3) in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate, for example, that advertisements for brands with FCCP and GCCP are nomologically different and evaluated differently.",0
Conjoining International Marketing and Relationship Marketing: Exploring Consumers? Cross-Border Service Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Research on international marketing constructs, such as consumer ethnocentrism and country-of-origin effects, typically focuses on consumers? initial evaluations of foreign products but ignores consumers? emerging cross-border exchange relationships with foreign service providers. The influence of international marketing constructs on the development of these relationships also seems to be largely ignored. The authors call for new research on cross-border service relationships and integration of relationship marketing with international marketing models. They introduce an exploratory test and develop a research agenda that identifies several avenues for further research. The empirical test involves a study of German consumers who regularly cross the German?Dutch border to attend to their accounts with a foreign (i.e., Dutch) bank. Loyalty to the foreign financial service provider may be explained using substantive relational antecedents, such as satisfaction, trust, and value, and international marketing antecedents, such as consumer ethnocentrism and consumer beliefs about the industry. The results show that the international variables complement the relationship model. The authors discuss the managerial and research implications and provide avenues for further research.",0
Healthy Choice: The Effect of Simplified Point-of-Sale Nutritional Information on Consumer Food Choice Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Grocery retailers are joining the fray against obesity by offering a wide range of health and wellness programs at the point of sale. However, the success of such programs in promoting healthy choices remains an open question. The authors examine the effectiveness of a growing health and wellness initiative: a simplified nutrition scoring system. They present a conceptual framework that predicts the effect of such a scoring system on shoppers? food decisions and their sensitivity to price and promotion, as well as the moderating influence of category-level factors. Using a large-scale quasi experiment and panel data across eight product categories for more than 535,000 members of a grocery chain's frequent shopper program, the authors demonstrate that the point-of-sale nutrition scoring system helped consumers make healthier food choices, such that they switched to higher-scoring products in the postrollout period. The results also reveal that shoppers became less price sensitive and more promotion sensitive following the introduction of the food scoring system. The authors discuss implications for research and practice.",1
Customer Profitability in a Supply Chain,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Estimating current profitability at the individual customer level is important to distinguish the more profitable customers from the less profitable ones. This is also a first step in developing estimates of customers' lifetime values. This exercise, however, takes on additional complexities when applied to an intermediary in a supply chain, such as a distributor, because the costs of servicing a retail customer include not only those incurred directly in servicing this customer but also those incurred by the distributor in dealing with its own vendors for goods supplied to this customer. The authors develop a general model and measurement methodology to relate customer profitability to customer characteristics in a supply chain. The authors show how heterogeneity in customer purchasing characteristics leads to important profit implications and illustrate the implementation of the methodology using data from a large distributor that supplies to grocery and other retail businesses.",0
The Determinants and Consequences of Search Cost Heterogeneity: Evidence from Local Gasoline Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Information frictions play a key role in an array of economic activities and are frequently incorporated into formal models as search costs. However, little is known about the underlying source of consumer search costs and how heterogeneous they are across markets. This study analyzes the sources and magnitude of heterogeneity in consumer search costs in retail gasoline markets. In doing so, the authors also investigate the extent to which retail gasoline stations employ mixed pricing strategies. They identify hundreds of geographically isolated markets and are the first to estimate the distribution of consumer search costs for many geographic markets. They directly recover the distribution of consumer search costs, market by market, using price data for retail gasoline in the United States. They find that the distribution of consumer search costs varies significantly across geographic markets and that distribution of household income is closely associated with search cost distribution.",1
Threat of Entry and Organizational-Form Choice: The Case of Franchising in Retailing,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Retail expansion is led by multistore firms, which often mix two organizational forms: franchised and company-owned outlets (?franchising decisions?). The authors examine whether strategic considerations in entry and expansion play a role in organizational-form decisions (e.g., franchising) in retailing. The authors utilize store count and revenues for franchised and company-owned outlets of nationwide convenience store chains in 47 geographical markets in Japan between 1984 and 2010. The empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry threat. The simulation analysis highlights how franchising decisions in response to an elevated threat of entry may be beneficial (or harmful) for an incumbent firm, which yields key implications for firms, consumers, and policy makers.",1
The Value of Marketing Crowdsourced New Products as Such: Evidence from Two Randomized Field Experiments,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"To complement their in-house, designer-driven efforts, companies are increasingly experimenting with crowdsourcing initiatives in which they invite their user communities to generate new product ideas. Although innovation scholars have begun to analyze the objective promise of crowdsourcing, the current research is unique in pointing out that merely marketing the source of design to customers might bring about an incremental increase in product sales. The findings from two randomized field experiments reveal that labeling crowdsourced new products as such?that is, marketing the product as ?customer-ideated? at the point of purchase versus not mentioning the specific source of design?increased the product's actual market performance by up to 20%. Two controlled follow-up studies reveal that the effect observed in two distinct consumer goods domains (food and electronics) can be attributed to a quality inference: consumers perceive ?customer-ideated? products to be based on ideas that address their needs more effectively, and the corresponding design mode is considered superior in generating promising new products.",1
The ?Commitment Projection? Effect: When Multiple Payments for a Product Affect Defection from a Service,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Many service providers offer supplementary products related to their ongoing services (e.g., fitness centers offer fitness smartwatches). In seven studies, the authors show that the payment method for such supplementary products (multiple payments vs. a single lump sum) affects customers? tendency to defect from the provider?s core service over time. Specifically, when customers pay for add-ons in multiple payments?provided that (1) they perceive the add-on as being bundled with the core service and (2) the payment period has an end point?they are initially less likely to defect from the service provider than when they pay in a single payment. Over time, however, as payments are made, this gap closes, such that defection intentions under the two payment methods eventually become similar. The authors propose that this phenomenon reflects ?commitment projection,? wherein a decrease in customers? commitment to the add-on product over time is projected onto their commitment to the service provider. These findings carry important managerial implications, given that many service providers offer add-on products in multiple-payment plans and that customers? defection decisions substantially affect firms? profitability.",1
Social Effects on Customer Retention,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This study explores the role of customers? social network in their defection from a service provider. The authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers? individual social networks. The study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. This effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: The extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors? average number of connections. Highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. These results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.",0
Market Orientation and Alternative Strategic Orientations: A Longitudinal Assessment of Performance Implications,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Although the merits of maintaining a market orientation have been extensively discussed in the literature, studies examining the empirical link between market orientation and performance have shown mixed results. The authors explore the relative performance effects of various dimensions of market orientation using a longitudinal approach based on letters to shareholders in corporate annual reports. Furthermore, the authors examine the relative effects of alternative strategic orientations that reflect different managerial priorities for the firm. The authors also extend previous work by considering the mediating effects of organizational learning and innovativeness on the orientation?performance relationship. The results show that firms possessing higher levels of competitor orientation, national brand focus, and selling orientation exhibit superior performance.",0
The Bright Side and Dark Side of Embedded Ties in Business-to-Business Innovation,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Although the number and importance of joint innovation projects between suppliers and their customers continue to rise, the literature has yet to resolve a key question: Do embedded ties with customers help or hurt supplier innovation? Drawing on both the tie strength and knowledge literatures, the authors theorize that embedded ties interact with supplier and customer innovation knowledge to influence supplier innovation. In a sample of 157 Dutch business-to-business innovation relationships, they observe that embedded ties weaken how much suppliers benefit from customer innovation knowledge because of worries about customer opportunism (the dark side of embedded ties). However, they uncover three moderating relationship and governance features that allow suppliers to overcome these dark-side effects and even increase innovation (the bright side of embedded ties). Finally, although the authors predicted a bright-side effect, they find that embedded ties neither help nor hinder the supplier to leverage its own innovation knowledge in the relationship.",0
Advertising to Bilinguals: Does the Language of Advertising Influence the Nature of Thoughts?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"When targeting bilingual consumers, advertisers have a choice to advertise in a bilingual's native language or in the country's dominant language. Within the Hispanic community in the United States, for example, Kellogg has a choice to advertise Frosted Flakes in English or in Spanish. But which is the better choice and why? This research considers whether the choice of language in advertising to bilinguals influences the types of thoughts they have in response to an advertisement. In other words, for a bilingual, can the exact same selling message cue different associations depending on the language in which it is presented? The underlying issue is whether advertisers can use language of execution as a strategic variable with which to generate certain types of associations that may facilitate persuasion. The authors consider this issue from a social cognition perspective. They hypothesize that a native-language advertisement is more likely to elicit self-referent thoughts about family, friends, home, or homeland, which in turn may lead to more positive attitude measures and behavioral intentions. Furthermore, the authors show that these effects are moderated by the consumption context presented in the advertisement.",0
"Looks Interesting, but what does it Do? Evaluation of Incongruent Product form Depends on Positioning",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Marketers struggle with how best to position innovative products that are incongruent with consumer expectations. Compounding the issue, many incongruent products are the result of innovative changes in product form intended to increase hedonic appeal. Crossing various product categories with various positioning tactics in a single meta-analytic framework, the authors find that positioning plays an important role in how consumers evaluate incongruent form. The results demonstrate that when a product is positioned on functional dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for moderately incongruent form than for congruent form. However, when a product is positioned on experiential dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent form than for moderately incongruent form. Importantly, an increase in perceived hedonic benefits mediates the former, whereas a decrease in perceived utilitarian benefits mediates the latter. The mediation effects are consistent with the view that consumers must first understand a product's functionality before engaging in hedonic consumption.",1
Preference Fluency in Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors propose that consumer choices are often systematically influenced by preference fluency (i.e., the subjective feeling that forming a preference for a specific option is easy or difficult). Four studies manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to-read font (Study 1) or by asking participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice (Studies 2?4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of decision conflict, these effects are obtained without changing the attributes of the alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or the reference points. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the results.",1
The Boundaries of Loss Aversion,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In this article, the authors propose some psychological principles to describe the boundaries of loss aversion. A key idea is that exchange goods that are given up ?as intended? do not exhibit loss aversion. For example, the authors propose that money given up in purchases is not generally subject to loss aversion. The results of several experiments provide preliminary support for the hypotheses. The authors find that, consistent with prospect theory, loss aversion provides a complete account of risk aversion for risks with equal probability to win or lose. The authors propose boundaries for this result and suggest further tests of the model.",1
The Effect of Decision Order on Purchase Quantity Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Consumers often resolve trade-offs in a particular order. For example, when making flavor and size decisions, consumers might first decide which flavors to choose and then decide which sizes of those flavors to choose. This research examines the effect of decision order on purchase quantity decisions. The authors build on prior work on decision difficulty and conflict to show that consumers choose more overall, and more variety, when they consider a less replaceable attribute in an earlier, rather than a later, stage in the purchase decision. For example, consumers choose a greater quantity when flavor (or brand) decisions precede, rather than follow, size decisions. The authors find that the degree of attribute replaceability also moderates the effect of decision order on quantity chosen. Furthermore, marketers can influence the amount chosen by altering the organization of the shelf display. Finally, the authors find that when consumers explicitly consider the possibility of deferring their decisions, the effect of decision order declines.",1
The Influence of Consumer Distractions on the Effectiveness of Food-Sampling Programs,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Sampling programs are a significant element of the promotions mix, particularly in the food category. In this research, the authors find that the degree to which consumers are distracted while sampling a product can influence the effectiveness of such programs. In particular, the authors find that distraction actually increases subsequent choice of the sampled food, a finding that is contrary to what industry experts predict. The authors propose a dual-process model of somatosensory experiences to account for the findings. In line with the model, the findings suggest that the ultimate pleasure that a consumer derives from the taste of a food sample depends on two components, an informational component and an affective component. Furthermore, the findings suggest that distraction affects the subsequent choice of the sampled item by increasing (decreasing) the impact of the affective component (informational component) on subsequent choice.",1
A Cognitive Model of People's Usage Estimations,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,The author explores how consumers anticipate product or service usage during the purchase deliberation and develops a descriptive model of the decision process in which consumers integrate their usage expectations into the choice between paying a flat fee for unlimited access or paying per use. The model helps explain why consumers habitually overestimate the likelihood of using enough to justify the flat fee and how this misperception depends on the perceived range of usage anticipated by the user.,1
Incidental Prices and Their Effect on Willingness to Pay,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Previous research has explored how both internal and external references prices affect consumer perceptions and consequently the price that consumers are willing to pay for a product or service. Historically researchers have examined the effects of exposure to prices for the same product, the same brand, or products in the same category. This research explores the effect of incidental prices on the consumer's willingness to pay. The authors define incidental prices as prices advertised, offered, or paid for unrelated products or goods that neither sellers nor buyers regard as relevant to the price of an item that they are engaged in selling or buying. More specifically, the authors examine how prices for products that buyers encounter unintentionally can serve as anchors, thus affecting willingness to pay for the product that they intend to buy. The findings have important implications for auction houses and online vendors as well as for conventional retailers.",1
Incommensurate Resources: Not Just More of the Same,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The pricing literature is replete with research that focuses on how consumers respond to sales promotions when both the reference level and the change are expressed in dollar terms (i.e., discounts). The psychophysics of pricing suggests that changes in monetary magnitude are not based on their absolute level, but rather on their deviation from some reference level, or how the change is ?framed.? Often, however, a promotion is presented in nonmonetary terms (e.g., a premium). When two resources are delivered simultaneously, but in different currencies (e.g., receive a free razor with the purchase of a can of shaving cream), the marginal value of the nonmonetary, incremental benefit may be difficult to evaluate in relation to the focal product or its price. Therefore, the value of the premium may be less likely than a comparable discount to be viewed in a relative sense and thus less likely to suffer from diminishing marginal returns. This research explores how people often fail to exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to an incremental benefit, or cost, when it is accrued in a currency other than the referent currency. The authors define two different carriers of wealth or welfare (i.e., resources) that are difficult to convert into any meaningful common unit of measurement as ?incommensurate.? This research introduces a novel mechanism for influencing whether people attend to absolute rather than relative differences. This work also offers guidance to managers who might benefit from the strategic use of nonmonetary promotions.",1
Role Stress and Effectiveness in Horizontal Alliances,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Horizontal arrangements are increasingly deployed in organizational networks, yet research has rarely examined the effectiveness of these alliances. The coalition of disparate corporate cultures yields appreciable levels of role stress for people in boundary-spanning positions. Dedicated assets and communication modality are factors that influence the level of role ambiguity and conflict. The authors implicate these facets of role stress as antecedents to four forms of effectiveness drawn from the competing values framework. The authors present alternative perspectives that examine the relationship between stress and performance. The received view frames role stressors as linear, negative antecedents to organizational outcomes. The authors contrast this perspective with theories that espouse triphasic, parabolic, and interactive influences of stressors on organizational outcomes. Data gathered with 218 managers of dual-branded retail oil outlets indicate that the relevance of these alternative perspectives is mitigated by the form of effectiveness pursued by the organization. The results support a linear relationship between role conflict and bargaining efforts, yet they also offer evidence of nonlinear influences of role ambiguity on contributions to sales, customer satisfaction, and competence. The study concludes with a discussion of relevance of the findings to the management of horizontal alliances and to interorganizational theory.",0
Marketing Performance Measurement Ability and Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Marketing practitioners are under increasing pressure to demonstrate their contribution to firm performance. It has been widely argued that an inability to account for marketing's contribution has undermined its standing within the firm. To respond to this pressure, marketers are investing in the development of performance measurement abilities, but to date, there have been no empirical studies of whether the ability to measure marketing performance has any actual effect on either firm performance or marketing's stature. In this study of senior marketing managers in high-technology firms, the authors examine the effect of ability to measure marketing performance on firm performance, using both primary data collected from senior marketers and secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. They also explore the effect of ability to measure marketing on marketing's stature within the firm, which is operationalized as chief executive officer satisfaction with marketing. The empirical results indicate that the ability to measure marketing performance has a significant impact on firm performance, profitability, stock returns, and marketing's stature within the firm.",0
Competitive Export Pricing: The Influence of the Information Context,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"This study investigates how the information context of cross-border exchanges influences the implementation and effectiveness of export pricing policies. Using a disaggregate approach to measure export pricing, the research shows the influence of the competitive intensity and the ambiguity of the foreign market on each facet of the pricing policy. In addition, this research investigates the effectiveness of these price manipulations in a context of information asymmetry. The findings suggest that exporters manipulate prices when confronted with competitive and ambiguous foreign markets. However, in most cases, these price manipulations have no impact on performance. Furthermore, when information asymmetry is high, export price manipulations deteriorate performance. The analysis uses survey data from 278 French exporters.",0
Endogenous Opportunism in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises? Foreign Subsidiaries: Classification and Research Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"This study examines the phenomenon of opportunism as a key factor behind international market-entry failure of small and medium-sized enterprises that use integrated modes of entry. The authors analyze field data generated from small and medium-sized enterprises using principles of grounded theory methodology. The inductive process identified various forms, types, and categories of intrafirm opportunistic behaviors. The classification process leads to research propositions pertaining to the antecedents and outcomes of endogenous opportunism.",0
Differential Effects of Bilateral Norms on SMEs? Export Relationships: A Dynamic Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Prior research has established the pivotal role of bilateral norms in relationship marketing, identifying them as effective relational governance mechanisms that firms can use to manage their international alliances with overseas intermediaries. Unfortunately, few studies have examined differential effects of specific norms on positive and negative behaviors, let alone norms? effectiveness in the harsh export context of resource-constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these gaps, the authors explicate the effects of three norms (continuity expectations, equity, and cooperation) on both dysfunctional and productive behaviors of foreign distributors. Using two consecutive data collections, the results indicate that norms curb importer opportunism and help improve importer role performance and that continuity expectations and cooperation increase the chances of the survival of export ventures. The study further scrutinizes relational norms? effects on opportunism in the context of exporting SMEs? realities and tests relevant moderating effects. The findings indicate that while exporter dependence reduces the shielding effect of norms against opportunism, psychic distance and competitive intensity strengthen the protecting effect of relational norms. The results of this study underscore the heterogeneous nature of relational norms and suggest that norms such as continuity expectations play a leading role in structuring the ideology of a business dyad.",0
Consumers? Emotional Bonds with Foreign Countries: Does Consumer Affinity Affect Behavioral Intentions?,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"The construct of consumer affinity, which captures country-specific favorable feelings toward particular foreign countries, was recently introduced in the international marketing literature. In this study, the authors conceptually advance the consumer affinity construct and develop a measurement instrument for capturing affinity feelings. They also link consumer affinity, country image, and consumer ethnocentrism to key consumer behavior variables?namely, perceived risk and willingness to buy products from, invest in, and visit the affinity country. The findings indicate that consumer affinity is more powerful than consumers? ethnocentric tendencies in explaining both perceived risk and willingness to buy. The results also show that consumer affinity is more influential than cognitive evaluations of a country for the majority of the behavioral outcomes considered in the study (perceived risk, visit intentions, and investment intentions). Thus, internationally active companies can benefit from leveraging consumer affinity feelings in addition to positive country images. Overall, the study emphasizes the important role of positive affect in shaping consumer behavior, thus complementing prior research that focuses exclusively on the behavioral implications of negative affect (most notably consumer animosity).",0
"The Consumer Affinity Construct: Conceptualization, Qualitative Investigation, and Research Agenda",Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Although the impact of negative attitudes toward foreign countries in general (e.g., as a consequence of ethnocentric tendencies) and specific countries in particular (e.g., as a result of animosity feelings) on consumption behavior has received considerable attention in the literature, the nature of and potential for behavioral consequences of favorable attitudes have largely been neglected. In this study, the authors explore the construct of consumer affinity as a favorable and country-specific attitude by drawing from both the interdisciplinary literature on country-related attitudes and a series of complementary qualitative studies. Specifically, the authors (1) identify the defining conceptual characteristics of the consumer affinity construct, (2) explore the underlying bases/sources of affinity, (3) provide insights into the behavioral consequences of consumer affinity in terms of consumer decision making, and (4) propose a nomological network and generate a series of research propositions to conceptually guide further research on the construct.",0
The Network Value of Products,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Traditionally, the value of a product has been assessed according to the direct revenues the product creates. However, products do not exist in isolation but rather influence one another's sales. Such influence is especially evident in e-commerce environments, in which products are often presented as a collection of web pages linked by recommendation hyperlinks, creating a large-scale product network. The authors present a systematic approach to estimate products? true value to a firm in such a product network. Their approach, which is in the spirit of the PageRank algorithm, uses available data from large-scale e-commerce sites and separates a product's value into its own intrinsic value, the value it receives from the network, and the value it contributes to the network. The authors demonstrate their approach using data collected from the product network of books on Amazon.com. Specifically, they show that the value of low sellers may be underestimated, whereas the value of best sellers may be overestimated. The authors explore the sources of this discrepancy and discuss the implications for managing products in the growing environment of product networks.",0
To Innovate or Imitate? Entry Strategy and the Role of Market Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,A firm planning market entry can attempt to develop a product that is either similar to the incumbent's existing offering (imitation) or entirely novel (innovation). The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes.,1
In Search of Negative Customer Feedback: The Effect of Expecting to Evaluate on Satisfaction Evaluations,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Customers' evaluations of quality and satisfaction are critical inputs in the development of marketing strategies. Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research.",1
The Effect of Stating Expectations on Customer Satisfaction and Shopping Experience,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Customers' expectations are key determinants of their consumption experiences, satisfaction, and loyalty. The authors examine alternative theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group, stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast, and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher postpurchase evaluations. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research.",1
The Robustness of the Effects of Consumers' Participation in Market Research: The Case of Service Quality Evaluations,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The authors propose that participation in market research can determine consumers' experiences with and evaluations of marketing services/products. Building on and extending a prior finding that expectation to evaluate a service (or product) leads to more negative evaluations, this research investigates the robustness, process, and consequences of asking consumers to form evaluations of services/products. The results of several field studies (conducted in Israel, Korea, and the United States) show that (1) the effect of expecting to evaluate on the service provider's performance evaluation is enduring and lasts beyond the immediate aftermath of the service encounter; (2) the effect of study participation on the perception of marketers reflects true perceptual change rather than ?made-up? perceptions?it requires supporting evidence and is eliminated if cognitive load interferes in the production of that evidence; and (3) the robust bias produced by expecting to evaluate cannot be eliminated by causing participants to consider the task effect on their evaluations or the impact of their feedback on the evaluated marketers. The authors discuss the broader implications of this research for understanding the impact of participation in market research on consumers' experiences and inputs.",0
"Market Entry and Priority of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Software Industry: An Empirical Analysis of Cultural Distance, Geographic Distance, and Market Size",Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This article investigates the influence of cultural distance, geographic distance, and three market size variables in the target country preference of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the software industry. In addition, the authors examine the shift of SMEs? priorities in country selection by analyzing how these factors affect the selection of the first, second, and third target countries. The empirical findings suggest that approximately 70% of country choices can be explained by software market size and geographic distance alone. The findings also show that SMEs? entry priorities shift quickly from countries within a short geographic distance to countries with high purchasing power and at a greater geographic distance. The authors discuss relationships of these macrolevel factors and compare them with prior qualitative and conceptual studies in this field. They also note implications for managers.",0
Justification Effects on Consumer Choice of Hedonic and Utilitarian Goods,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"People want to have fun, and they are more likely to have fun if the situation allows them to justify it. This research studies how people's need for justifying hedonic consumption drives two choice patterns that are observed in typical purchase contexts. First, relative preferences between hedonic and utilitarian alternatives can reverse, depending on how the immediate purchase situation presents itself. A hedonic alternative tends to be rated more highly than a comparable utilitarian alternative when each is presented singly, but the utilitarian alternative tends to be chosen over the hedonic alternative when the two are presented jointly. Second, people have preferences for expending different combinations of time (effort) and money for acquiring hedonic versus utilitarian items. They are willing to pay more in time for hedonic goods and more in money for utilitarian goods. The author explores the topic through a combination of four experiments and field studies.",1
Upgrades and New Purchases,Journal of Marketing,2006,"In many industries, firms introduce successive generations of new and enhanced product models to remain competitive. Product enhancements target first-time purchasers and consumers who already own an existing product and are considering upgrading to a new and enhanced product. Upgrade decisions differ from new purchase decisions because they are hindered by the psychological costs associated with the purchase price spent on the existing product. This research examines how the enhanced product can be positioned relative to the existing product to mitigate the psychological costs and facilitate upgrade purchases. A series of studies demonstrate that consumers with existing products are more likely to upgrade when the enhanced product is generally dissimilar to the existing product. Upgraders have stronger preferences than first-time purchasers for enhanced products with new features rather than for improvements on existing features, and they prefer enhancements that focus on a few key features rather than a general enhancement of all features.",0
Global Consumer Culture Positioning: Testing Perceptions of Soft-Sell and Hard-Sell Advertising Appeals between U.S. and Japanese Consumers,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"This study tests the effectiveness of global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) in terms of perceptions of soft-sell (indirect and image-based) and hard-sell (direct and information-based) appeals across markets. The authors draw the theoretical base for the study from previous research, along with a series of recent conceptualizations on culture and branding based on global consumer culture theory. If the same appeal is homogeneously and favorably perceived in different markets, such an appeal should be a good candidate for use as part of a GCCP strategy. From prior research, the authors predict that soft-sell appeals are more similarly perceived across markets than hard-sell appeals. They conduct a quasi-experimental study in the United States and Japan with a general consumer sample. After choosing six advertisements using rigorous content analysis, they examine the perceptions of soft-sell and hard-sell appeals, including attitude toward the ad, believability, irritation, and purchase intention. The results indicate somewhat more homogeneous acceptance of soft-sell appeals but, surprisingly, also show relatively homogeneous acceptance of hard-sell appeals across markets. These findings are suggestive of both types of appeals having the potential to be used as part of a GCCP across the United States and Japan and perhaps other markets.",0
Green Claims and Message Frames: How Green New Products Change Brand Attitude,Journal of Marketing,2014,"In response to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable (?green?) new products. Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the introduction of green new products changes attitude toward the brand. In examining this relationship, they draw from social identity and framing theories to investigate drivers of green new product introductions as well as the moderating effects of message framing, source credibility, and product type. Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on new product introductions from 75 brands across a four-year time period (2009?2012), the authors find that green new product introductions can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category's positioning influence the introduction of green new products. They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green new products change brand attitude. The authors use these findings to provide guidance for managers as they attempt to effectively link their green innovation efforts to improve consumer attitudes toward their brands.",0
"The Performance Implications of Fit among Business Strategy, Marketing Organization Structure, and Strategic Behavior",Journal of Marketing,2005,"Adopting a contingency perspective, the authors present and test a fit-as-moderation model that posits that overall firm performance is influenced by how well the marketing organization's structural characteristics (i.e., formalization, centralization, and specialization) and strategic behavioral emphases (i.e., customer, competitor, innovation, and cost control) complement alternative business strategies (i.e., prospector, analyzer, low-cost defender, and differentiated defender). Responses from 228 senior marketing managers provide support for the model and demonstrate that each strategy type requires different combinations of marketing organization structures and strategic behaviors for success.",0
Predicting and Managing Consumers' Package Size Impressions,Journal of Marketing,2013,"With rising public concerns about waste and overconsumption, predicting and effectively managing consumers' package size impressions have become critical for both marketers and public health advocates. The AddChange heuristic model of size impression assumes that people add (rather than multiply) the percentage changes in the height, width, and length of objects to compute their volume. This simple deterministic model does not require any data to accurately predict consumers' perceptions of product downsizing and supersizing when one, two, or all three dimensions change proportionately. It also explains why consumers perceive size reductions accurately when only one dimension of the package is reduced but completely fail to notice up to a 24% downsizing when the product is elongated in the manner specified by the model, even when they pay close attention or weigh the product by hand. The model can be used to determine the dimensions of packages that create accurate size perceptions or that increase consumers' acceptance of downsizing.",0
Frugality Is Hard to Afford,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Intertemporal savings strategies, such as bulk buying or accelerating purchase timing to take advantage of a good deal, provide long-term savings in exchange for an increase in immediate spending. Although households with limited financial resources stand to benefit the most from these strategies, they are less likely to make use of them. The authors provide causal evidence that liquidity constraints impede low-income households? ability to use these strategies, above and beyond the impact of other constraints. Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households? ability to use intertemporal savings strategies. The findings provide guidance to marketing managers and researchers regarding targeted promotional design and measurement of deal-proneness. For policy makers, they suggest a new path for decreasing the higher prices low-income households have been documented to pay for everyday goods. Policies have traditionally focused on increasing financial literacy or access to supermarkets. Our work suggests that providing greater liquidity can help low-income households make better use of savings opportunities already available to them.",1
Conditional Projection: How Own Evaluations Influence Beliefs about Others Whose Choices Are Known,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The authors study how a person's evaluation of choice options influences his or her estimates of other people's evaluations when their choices are known. The study shows that people rely on the relationship between their own evaluations and their final decision to make sense of others, projecting their evaluations of the corresponding options. A person's liking of the option he or she chose between two alternatives influences the person's estimates of others' liking of the option they chose, regardless of whether it matches his or her own choice. Likewise, a person's evaluation of the rejected option affects his or her estimate of others' evaluations of the option they rejected. Across four studies, the authors provide evidence of conditional projection in political and consumer decisions, using across-people differences in ratings of choice options, within-person changes in ratings, and manipulated differences in participants' ratings. The authors also demonstrate that existing accounts of projection do not directly predict these findings and rule out other alternative explanations.",1
Holistic Package Design and Consumer Brand Impressions,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article develops empirically based guidelines to assist managers in selecting or modifying package designs for achieving desired consumer responses. Seven studies identify the key types of package designs, including the factors that differentiate those package designs, and determine how these holistic designs are related to consumer brand impressions. The selection of package designs can be simplified with the use of five holistic types: massive, contrasting, natural, delicate, and nondescript designs. Sincere brands should have natural package designs, exciting brands should have contrasting designs, competent brands should have delicate designs, sophisticated brands should have natural or delicate designs, and rugged brands should have contrasting or massive designs. The authors discuss the potential trade-offs among the impressions created by holistic design types and illustrate their findings with numerous real packages.",0
Why Do Firms Invest in Consumer Advertising with Limited Sales Response? A Shareholder Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Marketing managers increasingly recognize the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. This study focuses on the shareholder value effects of pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) and direct-to-physician (DTP) marketing efforts. Although DTCA has moderate effects on brand sales and market share, companies invest vast amounts of money in it. Relying on Kalman filtering, the authors develop a methodology to assess the effects from DTCA and DTP on three components of shareholder value: stock return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Investors value DTCA positively because it leads to higher stock returns and lower systematic risk. Furthermore, DTCA increases idiosyncratic risk, which does not affect investors who maintain well-diversified portfolios. In contrast, DTP marketing has modest positive effects on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. The outcomes indicate that evaluations of marketing expenditures should include a consideration of the effects of marketing on multiple stakeholders, not just the sales effects on consumers.",0
Early Marketing Matters: A Time-Varying Parameter Approach to Persistence Modeling,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Are persistent marketing effects most likely to appear right after the introduction of a product? The authors give an affirmative answer to this question by developing a model that explicitly reports how persistent and transient marketing effects evolve over time. The proposed model provides managers with a valuable tool to evaluate their allocation of marketing expenditures over time. An application of the model to many pharmaceutical products, estimated through (exact initial) Kalman filtering, indicates that both persistent and transient effects occur predominantly immediately after a brand's introduction. Subsequently, the size of the effects declines. The authors theoretically and empirically compare their methodology with methodology based on unit root testing and demonstrate that the need for unit root tests creates difficulties in applying conventional persistence modeling. The authors recommend that marketing models should either accommodate persistent effects that change over time or be applied to mature brands or limited time windows only.",1
Successful Operating Strategies in the Performance of U.S.-China Joint Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Evaluations of the performance of international joint ventures (IJVs) in China have produced mixed conclusions. This study sought to uncover performance criteria used by various groups of managers and to identify critical factors in IJV performance in China. Using in-depth case studies, matched data were collected from personal interviews with managers from Chinese and U.S. parent companies, joint venture operating managers from both partners, and government officials from both countries. The performance criteria used by joint venture participants appear to be converging, with profitability emerging as the dominant element. This exploratory study uncovered four important strategic factors in the performance of large, established U.S.-China manufacturing joint ventures. These are controlling decision making, establishing a sales network, retaining interpartner learning, and influencing government officials. The results suggest that the importance of decision-making control is moderated by size of the venture and nationality. Whether the IJV is a part of the government's National Plan also appears to be an important contingency. Managerial implications and directions for future research are provided.",0
An Integrated Model of Discrete Choice and Response Time,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Computer and Web-based interviewing tools have made response times ubiquitous in marketing research. Practitioners use these data as an indicator of data quality, and academics use them as an indicator of latent processes related to memory, attributes, and decision making. The authors investigate a Poisson race model with choice and response times as dependent variables. The model facilitates inference about respondents' preferences for choice alternatives, their diligence in providing responses, and the accessibility of attitudes and the speed of thinking. Thus, the model distinguishes between respondents who are quick to think and those who are quick to react but do so without much thought. Empirically, the authors find support for the endogenous nature of response times and demonstrate that models that treat response times as exogenous variables may result in misleading inferences.",1
The Abercrombie & Fitch Effect: The Impact of Physical Dominance on Male Customers' Status-Signaling Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Consumer lay theory suggests that women will spend more money than men in the presence of a physically dominant male employee, whereas theories of intrasexual competition from evolutionary psychology predict the opposite outcome. A retail field study demonstrates that male customers spend more money and purchase more expensive products than their female counterparts in the presence (vs. absence) of a physically dominant male employee. This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated feelings of intrasexual (male-to-male) competitiveness drive them to spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and to prefer and draw larger brand logos. Because pictorial exposure is sufficient for the effect to occur, these findings are not limited to in-store interactions with dominant male employees but have broad implications for marketing and advertising.",1
"Consumer Racism and Its Effects on Domestic Cross-Ethnic Product Purchase: An Empirical Test in the United States, Canada, and France",Journal of Marketing,2007,"This study provides empirical evidence of the effects of consumer racism on domestic cross-ethnic product purchase in three countries. The model predicts that consumer racism will affect ethnic majorities? judgments of and willingness to buy products from each country's dominant ethnic minority. After a consumer racism measurement instrument is developed and validated, experiments and survey results show that varying levels of consumer racism affect consumer judgments of and willingness to buy domestic products that are perceived as being made by ethnic minorities in the three countries in which the tests took place. Moreover, the results indicate that minority-owned business performance is significantly and negatively affected in areas in which consumer racism is more prevalent. Moderators of consumer racism effects are the perceived level of interaction between consumers and the minority-owned company, a certain product-ethnicity image, and consumers? perceived importance of the outcome associated with consuming minority-owned companies? products and/or services.",0
The Effect of Collectivism on the Importance of Relationship Quality and Service Quality for Behavioral Intentions: A Cross-National and Cross-Contextual Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"The authors explore when and how collectivism influences the importance of service quality and relationship quality for behavioral intentions. Using goal and action identification theories, they argue that collectivist tendencies become salient depending on a buyer's particular goal in a given service context and that when collectivist characteristics are salient, they can influence the importance of service or relationship quality. In the first study, the authors demonstrate the moderation effect of collectivism in a high-social-interaction context, in which they argue that collectivist tendencies are salient, using data collected in countries characterized as high and low in collectivism, and find that collectivism increases the importance of relationship and service quality (contrary to the hypothesized negative effect) for behavioral intentions. In the second study, the authors find that collectivism does not moderate the aforementioned relationships in contexts in which social interaction is expected to be low. The cross-national and cross-contextual findings provide multinational retailers guidance in designing the customer retail experience on the basis of the collectivist tendencies of consumers in various markets.",0
Geographical Information Systems?Based Marketing Decisions: Effects of Alternative Visualizations on Decision Quality,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Marketing planners often use geographical information systems (GISs) to help identify suitable retail locations, regionally distribute advertising campaigns, and target direct marketing activities. Geographical information systems thematic maps facilitate the visual assessment of map regions. A broad set of alternative symbolizations, such as circles, bars, or shading, can be used to visually represent quantitative geospatial data on such maps. However, there is little knowledge on which kind of symbolization is the most adequate in which problem situation. In a large-scale experimental study, the authors show that the type of symbolization strongly influences decision performance. The findings indicate that graduated circles are appropriate symbolizations for geographical information systems thematic maps, and their successful utilization seems to be virtually independent of personal characteristics, such as spatial ability and map experience. This makes circle symbolizations particularly suitable for effective decision making and cross-functional communication.",0
The Interplay between Global and Local Brands: A Closer Look at Perceived Brand Globalness and Local Iconness,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"By studying consumer samples in an emerging market, Turkey, and two mature markets, Singapore and Denmark, the author tests the chain of relationships that drive consumers? likelihood of purchasing the global brand in the presence of a local brand in a linear structural relations framework. The results indicate that perceived brand globalness is positively related to local iconness in an emerging market, but the relationship is negative in advanced markets. Developing local iconness helps build the perception of prestige in all three markets. Furthermore, local iconness is positively related to local brand quality perceptions in the culturally grounded categories of food in an emerging market, whereas in nonfood categories, local iconness has no connection to quality. In terms of cross-effects, as expected, the perceived quality of the local brand is negatively associated with global brand purchase likelihood in all markets and categories studied. In contrast, local brand prestige dampens global brand purchase likelihood for older consumers in an emerging market. The article concludes with implications for global and local brand managers.",0
Global Brand Purchase Likelihood: A Critical Synthesis and an Integrated Conceptual Framework,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors build a model of global brand attitude and purchase likelihood with a nomological net comprised of constructs derived from three theoretical streams in consumer behavior: consumer culture theory, signaling theory, and the associative network memory model. By integrating these diverse theories, the authors provide a conceptual framework, explaining the processes leading to consumers? attitudes toward and likelihood of purchasing global brands. Global brand authenticity, cultural capital, and perceived brand globalness are constructs based mainly on consumer culture theory, and global brand credibility is borrowed from signaling theory. Global brand quality, social responsibility, prestige, and relative price are included as brand associations, deriving mainly from the associative network memory model. These constructs have direct and indirect effects on global brand attitude and global brand purchase likelihood, reflecting the three-dimensional belief?attitude?behavior model in consumer behavior. The authors also introduce self-construal and cosmopolitanism as two pertinent moderators of some of the model paths.",0
A Resource-Based Model of Market Learning in the Subsidiary: The Capabilities of Exploration and Exploitation,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"The literature reflects remarkably little effort to develop a framework for understanding market learning at subsidiaries of multinational corporations. This article develops a model that incorporates exploratory and exploitative learning as two capabilities that need to be effectively nurtured and managed in subsidiaries. The authors integrate the organizational-learning and resource-based view of the firm; present field interviews with managers; and propose that resources derived from the parent, the subsidiary, and the parent?subsidiary relationships are related to the creation of new knowledge and the use of existing knowledge in subsidiaries. The authors develop research propositions that capture the differential impacts of each learning capability on subsidiary performance. It is suggested that the turbulence of subsidiary markets moderates the strength of the relationships between market-learning capabilities and performance.",0
Competing Perspectives in International Marketing Strategy: Contingency and Process Models,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Empirical studies investigating the relationship between marketing standardization and performance have generated mixed results. This study investigates the causal ordering between marketing strategy and marketing structure as determinants of subsidiary performance. The authors propose a multiple contingencies approach that tests both the contingency (e.g., Chandler 1962) and the process (e.g., Bower 1970) frameworks in the subsidiary context. Findings based on a two-phase longitudinal study provide initial support for the framework that suggests that marketing structure follows marketing strategy. In response to increased target market similarity, companies in the study opted for more standardized marketing strategies. Furthermore, centralization of structure mediated the relationship between marketing strategy and subsidiary performance. The performance impact of centralization, however, was cross-lagged and negative. Results suggest adapting marketing strategies to local markets as a way of enhancing performance.",0
The Role of Market Orientation in Advertising Spending during Economic Collapse: The Case of Turkey in 2001,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors investigate the role of market orientation in advertising spending during economic contraction. They use the 2001 economic collapse in Turkey as the empirical context in which to test hypotheses regarding why some firms increase their advertising spending in a contraction period while the majority of firms cut back. Analyzing market orientation at the level of its intelligence and responsiveness facets, they find the responsiveness facet to be positively associated with increases in advertising spending but observe the intelligence facet to be negatively associated with advertising spending. Importantly, positive shifts in advertising spending during the economic contraction predict better subsequent business performance. The opposing roles of the intelligence and responsiveness facets disappear in a subsequent economic expansion period. These findings have managerial and theoretical implications. Firms that nurture the responsiveness facet of market orientation during economic contractions go against the tide to increase their advertising spending and experience the performance benefits that such countercyclical actions can amass.",1
How Language Shapes Word of Mouth's Impact,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Word of mouth affects consumer behavior, but how does the language used in word of mouth shape that impact? Might certain types of consumers be more likely to use certain types of language, affecting whose words have more influence? Five studies, including textual analysis of more than 1,000 online reviews, demonstrate that compared to more implicit endorsements (e.g., ?I liked it,? ?I enjoyed it?), explicit endorsements (e.g., ?I recommend it?) are more persuasive and increase purchase intent. This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices. These findings highlight the important role that language, and endorsement styles in particular, plays in shaping the effects of word of mouth.",1
(I'm) Happy to Help (You): The Impact of Personal Pronoun Use in Customer?Firm Interactions,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"In responding to customer questions or complaints, should marketing agents linguistically ?put the customer first? by using certain personal pronouns? Customer orientation theory, managerial literature, and surveys of managers, customer service representatives, and consumers suggest that firm agents should emphasize how ?we? (the firm) serve ?you? (the customer), while de-emphasizing ?I? (the agent) in these customer?firm interactions. The authors find evidence of this language pattern in use at over 40 firms. However, they theorize and demonstrate that these personal pronoun emphases are often suboptimal. Five studies using lab experiments and field data reveal that firm agents who refer to themselves using ?I? rather than ?we? pronouns increase customers? perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. In turn, these positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior. Furthermore, the authors find that customer-referencing ?you? pronouns have little impact on these outcomes and can sometimes have negative consequences. These findings enhance understanding of how, when, and why language use affects social perception and behavior and provide valuable insights for marketers.",1
Who Receives Credit or Blame? The Effects of Made-to-Order Production on Responses to Unethical and Ethical Company Production Practices,Journal of Marketing,2019,"While prior research has found that consumer-influenced production improves purchase intentions, the author proposes that it can counterintuitively backfire. This work demonstrates that when consumers have some control over production (e.g., ordering products on demand, customization, preordering), they have lower purchase intentions for products made with unethical processes (e.g., pollution, underpaid labor) than if they had no role in production (i.e., buying what is already in inventory). This effect reverses, however, with positive ethical production (e.g., recycled materials). Because consumers have direct responsibility for whether a product is made, feelings of anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of the production process. This work also proposes a novel threefold conceptualization of responsibility that can be used as managerial levers: direct responsibility, diffusion of responsibility, and broad responsibility. Field studies using Facebook?s advertising platform demonstrate positioning strategies for fair-trade brands and advocacy groups.",0
Positioning Brands against Large Competitors to Increase Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors explore the effects of having a large dominant competitor and show conditions under which focusing on a competitive threat, rather than hiding it, can actually help a brand. Through lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harm them. The results show that support for small brands goes up when faced with a competitive threat from large brands versus when they are in competition with brands that are similar to them or when consumers view them outside a competitive context. This support translates into purchase intentions, real purchases, and more favorable online reviews in a study of more than 10,000 Yelp posts. The authors argue that this ?framing-the-game effect? is mediated by consumers' motivation to express their views and have an impact in the marketplace through their purchase choices.",1
Who Is Wary of User Design? The Role of Power-Distance Beliefs in Preference for User-Designed Products,Journal of Marketing,2019,"This article evaluates when a user-design approach is and is not effective in strengthening brand preference. It specifically delves into the role of power-distance beliefs in influencing preferences for user-designed products and brands. The authors demonstrate that low-power-distance consumers prefer user-designed products to company-designed products, whereas this effect is attenuated or reversed for high-power-distance consumers. The authors find process evidence that both feelings of empowerment and values of expertise differentially mediate brand preferences depending on power-distance beliefs, thus extending prior research findings. Field experiments conducted in the United States and cross-culturally (Austria and Guatemala) with Facebook?s advertising platform provide convergent evidence using country and political orientation as managerially accessible proxies. This research sheds light on when and why firms should be wary of user-design approaches, based on how power-distance beliefs drive consumers? preferences.",0
Interfirm Relational Drivers of Customer Value,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article integrates social network and exchange theory to develop a model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the decision-making capability of relational contacts). The results suggest that the value generated from interfirm relationships derives not only from the quality of customer ties (e.g., trust, commitment, norms), as is typically modeled, but also from the number and decision-making capability of interfirm contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446 business-to-business exchanges.",0
A Comparative Longitudinal Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives of Interorganizational Relationship Performance,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Four theoretical perspectives currently dominate attempts to understand the drivers of successful interorganizational relationship performance: (1) commitment?trust, (2) dependence, (3) transaction cost economics, and (4) relational norms. Each perspective specifies a different set and distinct causal ordering of focal constructs as the most critical for understanding performance. Using four years of longitudinal data (N = 396), the authors compare the relative efficacy of these four perspectives for driving exchange performance and provide empirical insights into the causal ordering among key interorganizational constructs. The results demonstrate the parallel and equally important roles of commitment?trust and relationship-specific investments as immediate precursors to and key drivers of exchange performance. Building on the insights gleaned from tests of the four frameworks, the authors parsimoniously integrate these perspectives within a single model of interfirm relationship performance consistent with a resource-based view of an exchange. Managers may be able to increase performance by shifting resources from ?relationship building? to specific investments targeted toward increasing the efficacy or effectiveness of the relationship itself to improve the relationship's ability to create value. Moderation analysis indicates that managers may find it productive to allocate more relationship marketing efforts and investments to exchanges in markets with higher levels of uncertainty.",0
Factors Influencing the Effectiveness of Relationship Marketing: A Meta-Analysis,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Relationship marketing (RM) has emerged as one of the dominant mantras in business strategy circles, though RM investigations often yield mixed results. To help managers and researchers improve the effectiveness of their efforts, the authors synthesize RM empirical research in a meta-analytic framework. Although the fundamental premise that RM positively affects performance is well supported, many of the authors? findings have significant implications for research and practice. Relationship investment has a large, direct effect on seller objective performance, which implies that additional meditated pathways may explain the impact of RM on performance. Objective performance is influenced most by relationship quality (a composite measure of relationship strength) and least by commitment. The results also suggest that RM is more effective when relationships are more critical to customers (e.g., service offerings, channel exchanges, business markets) and when relationships are built with an individual person rather than a selling firm (which partially explains the mixed effects between RM and performance reported in previous studies).",0
Relationship Velocity: Toward a Theory of Relationship Dynamics,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The dynamic components of relational constructs should play an important role in driving performance. To take an initial step toward a theory of relationship dynamics, the authors introduce the construct of commitment velocity?or the rate and direction of change in commitment?and articulate its important role in understanding relationships. In two studies, the authors demonstrate that commitment velocity has a strong impact on performance, beyond the impact of the level of commitment. In Study 1, modeling six years of longitudinal data in a latent growth curve analysis, the authors empirically demonstrate the significance of commitment velocity as a predictor of performance. In Study 2, the authors use matched multiple-source data to investigate the drivers of commitment velocity. Both customer trust and dynamic capabilities for creating value through exchange relationships (i.e., communication capabilities for exploring and investment capabilities for exploiting opportunities) affect commitment velocity. However, trust and communication capabilities become less impactful as a relationship ages, while investment capabilities grow more important. The authors offer three post hoc tenets that represent initial components of a theory of relationship dynamics that integrates two streams of relationship marketing research into a unified perspective.",0
The Role of Customer Gratitude in Relationship Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Most theories of relationship marketing emphasize the role of trust and commitment in affecting performance outcomes; however, a recent meta-analysis indicates that other mediating mechanisms are at work. Data from two studies?a laboratory experiment and a dyadic longitudinal field survey?demonstrate that gratitude also mediates the influence of a seller's relationship marketing investments on performance outcomes. Specifically, relationship marketing investments generate short-term feelings of gratitude that drive long-lasting performance benefits based on gratitude-related reciprocal behaviors. The authors identify a set of managerially relevant factors and test their power to alter customer perceptions of relationship marketing investments to increase customer gratitude, which can make relationship marketing programs more effective. Overall, the research empirically demonstrates that gratitude plays an important role in understanding how relationship marketing investments increase purchase intentions, sales growth, and share of wallet.",0
Customer Loyalty to Whom? Managing the Benefits and Risks of Salesperson-Owned Loyalty,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"In a study of 362 buyer?salesperson dyads using triadic data (from buyer, salesperson, and sales manager), the authors examine both a customer's overall loyalty to the selling firm and the customer's loyalty vested specifically in his or her salesperson. They find that only salesperson-owned loyalty, a newly identified construct, directly affects the more tangible seller financial outcomes of sales growth and selling effectiveness, whereas both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm increase the customer's willingness to pay a price premium. A longitudinal study verifies that the positive effect of salesperson-owned loyalty on sales growth persists over time. However, because salesperson-owned loyalty simultaneously increases the seller's risk of losing business if the salesperson defects to a competitor, managers need to manage effectively the benefit?risk trade-off. Increasing relationship-enhancing activities and value received by the customer builds both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm. The loyalty-building impact of relationship-enhancing activities is moderated by selling-firm consistency and by the selling firm's and salesperson's loyalty-capturing strategies.",1
The Firm Value and Marketing Intensity Decision in Conditions of Financial Constraint: A Comparative Study of the United States and Latin America,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Marketing managers generally have to make marketing decisions under financial constraints (i.e., the firm?s inability to generate cash flow for investments and marketing), with limited assurance of the outcomes. Little investigation has been made into the effect of financial constraints on marketing intensity and the subsequent effect on firm value and performance, particularly when it is a volatile environment (e.g., Latin America) that creates the financial constraints. Using a conceptual framework grounded in agency theory, the authors develop a model and test it using a panel data set from the United States and five Latin American countries. The results indicate that financial constraints have a negative effect on marketing intensity and ultimately negatively affect firm value and performance. Furthermore, this study confirms the effect of three moderators?market sensitivity, country governance quality, and country economic development distance?on the relationship between financial constraint and marketing intensity and helps explain differences across the United States and Latin America.",0
Sales Force Downsizing and Firm-Idiosyncratic Risk: The Contingent Role of Investors? Screening and Firm?s Signaling Processes,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Although sales force downsizing represents a challenging marketing resource change that can signal uncertainty about future firm performance, little is known about its impact on financial-market performance. Drawing from information economics, the authors address this knowledge gap by developing a comprehensive framework to (1) examine the impact of the size of a firm?s sales force downsizing on firm-idiosyncratic risk, (2) uncover investors? screening processes that influence this relationship, and (3) identify firms? mitigating signaling processes that can alleviate investor uncertainty linked to downsizing. The authors draw from several secondary sources to assemble a longitudinal data set of 314 U.S. public firms over 12 years and model their framework using a robust econometric approach. Findings show that larger sales force reductions are associated with greater firm-idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, this increase in risk is amplified when firms face high levels of future competitive threats and lack transparency in financial reporting. However, chief executive officers can mitigate these deleterious moderating effects by signaling a commitment to growth (i.e., increasing advertising expenditures) and formally communicating an external strategic focus to Wall Street.",0
Salesperson Solution Involvement and Sales Performance: The Contingent Role of Supplier Firm and Customer?Supplier Relationship Characteristics,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Salespeople play a crucial role in their firms? efforts to provide customer solutions. However, little research has examined how salesperson involvement in customer solutions can be conceptualized, whether it pays off, and what boundary conditions might heighten its performance effects. This study addresses these gaps and offers a conceptualization of salesperson solution involvement by focusing on the set of salesperson-related activities that enact the four relational processes inherent in customer solutions. The authors collect a unique data set that includes a wide range of firms, industries, and countries, as well as the perspectives of both salespeople and customers, across five studies. Results validate the stability of the conceptualization across contexts. They also reveal that salesperson solution involvement is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective, time-lagged measures of sales performance. Finally, results show that the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement are amplified under higher levels of firm's product portfolio scope, sales unit cross-functional cooperation, and customer?supplier relationship tie strength. Surprisingly, customer adaptiveness is not found to moderate the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement.",0
Optimal Marketing Strategies for a Customer Data Intermediary,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Advances in data collection and storage technologies have given rise to the customer data intermediary (CDI), a firm that collects customer data to offer customer-specific marketing services to marketers. With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI?a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers?using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services.",1
Bandwagon Pressures and Interfirm Alliances in the Global Pharmaceutical Industry,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"This study examines the applicability of a bandwagon explanation for interfirm alliances in the global pharmaceutical industry. A sample of alliances undertaken by 43 firms, with headquarters in the United States, Europe, and Japan, in the period 1975 to 1989, was analyzed. Bandwagon pressures, measured by the proportion of other firms in one's peer group undertaking alliances and their average number of alliances, was found to influence both the probability that a firm will undertake at least one alliance and the number of alliances it undertakes.",0
The Impact of Control on International Joint Venture Performance: A Contingency Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"The authors hypothesize that the exercise of control increases the performance of international joint ventures only when transaction costs are high and when there are large differences between partners and no prior business relationships. Using survey responses and secondary data, the authors find partial support for a contingent control?performance relationship.",0
"Old Country Passions: An International Examination of Country Image, Animosity, and Affinity among Ethnic Consumers",Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Ethnic consumers are an important market segment in both traditionally multicultural countries and newer destinations of growing immigration waves. Such consumers may carry with them ?old country passions? that may influence their attitudes toward the products of countries perceived as friendly or hostile in relation to the consumers? original home countries. This study is the first to examine together four place-related constructs?namely, country and people images, product images, affinity, and animosity?and their potential effects on purchase intentions for products from countries that may be perceived as friends or foes from the perspective of the ethnic consumers? homeland, while also juxtaposing these measures against views toward a neutral ?benchmark? country for comparison. The results show that country/people and product images, affinity, and animosity work differently depending on the target country; both affective and cognitive factors influence product and people evaluations; and attitudes vary in their predictive ability on purchase intentions. The article concludes with a discussion implications from the findings and directions for further research.",0
Building Customer Loyalty in Intercultural Service Encounters: The Role of Service Employees? Cultural Intelligence,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Intercultural service encounters, in which customers and service employees from different cultures interact, are becoming more common in the market. Despite the importance of such encounters for international marketers, limited research attention has been directed to this area. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study examines how frontline employees? cultural intelligence (CQ) influences customer loyalty outcomes of service quality perceptions. Specifically, the authors propose that the three components of CQ?cognitive, emotional/motivational, and physical?have differential moderating effects on the perceived service quality (PSQ)?customer loyalty link and that these effects vary across two national markets. Data collected with a multirespondent (i.e., frontline service employees and customers) cross-cultural research design indicate that cognitive CQ negatively mitigates the impact of PSQ on customer loyalty in an emerging-market context while emotional/motivational CQ has a positive moderating effect in a mature-market setting. When service employees have high physical CQ, the positive role of PSQ in creating and maintaining customer loyalty is strengthened in both markets. The authors discuss these implications for theory and practice.",0
"The Dynamic Interplay between Recorded Music and Live Concerts: The Role of Piracy, Unbundling, and Artist Characteristics",Journal of Marketing,2017,"The business model for musicians relies on selling recorded music and selling concert tickets. Traditionally, demand for one format (e.g., concerts) would stimulate demand for the other format (e.g., recorded music) and vice versa, leading to an upward demand spiral. However, the market for recorded music is under pressure due to piracy and the unbundling of albums, which also entail threats for the traditional demand spiral. Despite the fundamental importance of recorded music and live concerts for the multibillion-dollar music industry, no prior research has studied their dynamic interplay. This study fills this void by developing new theory on how piracy, unbundling, artist fame, and music quality affect dynamic cross-format elasticities between record demand and concert demand. The theory is tested with a unique data set covering weekly concert and recorded music revenues for close to 400 artists across more than six years in the world's third-largest music market, Germany. The cross-format elasticity of record on concert revenue is much stronger than the reverse elasticity of concert on record revenue. The results show the key role of piracy, unbundling, and artist characteristics on these cross-format elasticities, which have implications for the business model of the music industry.",0
"When, How, and with what Success? The Joint Effect of Entry Timing and Entry Mode on Survival of Japanese Subsidiaries in China",Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This study examines the question whether joint ventures or wholly owned subsidiaries are more likely to survive in the context of Japanese subsidiaries in China. The author suggests that the answer to this question depends on the time the subsidiary was established. Specifically, it is argued that joint ventures founded during the early stage of institutional reforms are more likely to survive than wholly owned subsidiaries set up at that time, and vice versa for subsidiaries established in the late phase of institutional reforms. The rationale for these propositions is that at the beginning of market-oriented reforms, contributions provided by local partners make shared ownership an optimal entry mode strategy, whereas a relatively stable regulatory framework in the late stage of institutional reforms enables the firm to realize benefits associated with sole ownership more efficiently.

Choosing What I Want versus Rejecting What I Do Not Want: An Application of Decision Framing to Product Option Choice Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors examine the effects of using a subtractive versus an additive option-framing method on consumers' option choice decisions in three studies. The former option-framing method presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The latter presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Combined, the studies support the managerial attractiveness of the subtractive versus the additive option-framing method. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. This effect holds across different option price levels (Study 1) and product categories of varying price (Study 2). Moreover, this effect is magnified when subjects are asked to anticipate regret from their option choice decisions (Study 2). However, option framing has a different effect on the purchase likelihood of the product category itself, depending on the subject's initial interest in buying within the category. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low (Study 3). In addition, the three studies reveal several other findings about the attractiveness of subtractive versus additive option framing from the standpoint of consumers and managers. These findings, in turn, offer interesting public policy and future research implications.",1
Brand Attachment and Brand Attitude Strength: Conceptual and Empirical Differentiation of Two Critical Brand Equity Drivers,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Research has not verified the theoretical or practical value of the brand attachment construct in relation to alternative constructs, particularly brand attitude strength. The authors make conceptual, measurement, and managerial contributions to this research issue. Conceptually, they define brand attachment, articulate its defining properties, and differentiate it from brand attitude strength. From a measurement perspective, they develop and validate a parsimonious measure of brand attachment, test the assumptions that underlie it, and demonstrate that it indicates the concept of attachment. They also demonstrate the convergent and discriminant validity of this measure in relation to brand attitude strength. Managerially, they demonstrate that brand attachment offers value over brand attitude strength in predicting (1) consumers? intentions to perform difficult behaviors (those they regard as using consumer resources), (2) actual purchase behaviors, (3) brand purchase share (the share of a brand among directly competing brands), and (4) need share (the extent to which consumers rely on a brand to address relevant needs, including those brands in substitutable product categories).",0
"Social Dollars in Online Communities: The Effect of Product, User, and Network Characteristics",Journal of Marketing,2018,"Online communities have experienced burgeoning popularity over the last decade and have become a key platform for users to share information and interests, and to engage in social interactions. Drawing on the social contagion literature, the authors examine the effect of online social connections on users? product purchases in an online community. They assess how product, user, and network characteristics influence the social contagion effect in users? spending behavior. The authors use a unique large-scale data set from a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game community?consisting of users? detailed gaming activities, their social connections, and their in-game purchases of functional and hedonic products?to examine the impact of gamers? social networks on their purchase behavior. The analysis, based on a double-hurdle model that captures gamers? decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of ?social dollars,? whereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases. Interestingly, the results indicate that social influence varies across different types of products. Specifically, the effect of a focal user's network ties on his or her spending on hedonic products is greater than the effect of network ties on the focal user's spending on functional products. Furthermore, the authors find that user experience negatively moderates social contagion for functional products, whereas it positively moderates contagion for hedonic products. In addition, dense networks enhance contagion over functional product purchases, whereas they mitigate the social influence effect over hedonic product purchases. The authors perform a series of tests and robustness checks to rule out the effect of confounding factors. They supplement their econometric analyses with dynamic matching techniques and estimate average treatment effects. The results of the study have implications for both theory and practice and help provide insights on how managers can monetize social networks and use social information to increase user engagement in online communities.",0
"I Think I Can, I Think I Can: Brand Use, Self-Efficacy, and Performance",Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"When consumers struggle with a difficult task, using a brand can help them perform better. The authors report four studies showing that brand use can enhance feelings of self-efficacy, which can lead to better task performance. Students scored higher on difficult Graduate Records Examination questions when they took the test using a Massachusetts Institute of Technology pen (Study 1) and showed better athletic performance when they drank water from a Gatorade cup during strenuous athletic exercise (Studies 2 and 3). These increases in task performance were mediated by feelings of self-efficacy (Studies 3 and 4). Furthermore, the results show that not everyone experiences the beneficial effect of brand use; it depends on the person's implicit self-theory. Across studies, users adopting entity theories (?entity theorists?) showed increased self-efficacy and better task performance, whereas users adopting incremental theories (?incremental theorists?) were unaffected by brand use.",1
Capital Market Returns to New Product Development Success: Informational Effects on Product Market Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors aim to answer the following question: If the capital market reacts with abnormal stock returns to new product development success events, do these returns influence subsequent marketing decisions? Drawing on informational market feedback and managerial learning theories, the authors posit that when firms are uncertain about how responsive the product market will be to their marketing activities, signals received from the capital market help them update their beliefs about the product market?s responsiveness. In the pharmaceutical context, the authors decompose the abnormal returns at a new drug approval event into components that the firm can and cannot predict (i.e., predicted and unpredicted abnormal returns) and find that the postapproval advertising budget is larger when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher. Furthermore, this tendency is more pronounced for spending on detailing than for direct-to-consumer advertising. Consistent with these higher budgets, the authors find that postlaunch advertising is more effective when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher, particularly for detailing spending (vs. direct-to-consumer advertising). Overall, this study suggests that information flows from the capital market?s initial perceptions at new product introduction play an important role in subsequent marketing decisions in the product market.",1
Simulated Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the Random Coefficient Logit Model Using Aggregate Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors propose a simulated maximum likelihood estimation method for the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data, accounting for heterogeneity and endogeneity. The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's ?control function? approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated. However, the authors find in simulations that demand estimates are fairly robust to violations of these assumptions.",1
"An Integrated Model for Bidding Behavior in Internet Auctions: Whether, Who, When, and how Much",Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors develop a general parametric modeling framework for bidding behavior in Internet auctions. Toward this end, they incorporate four key components of the bidding process under their framework: whether people bid on an auction, (if so) who bids, when they bid, and how much they bid over the entire sequence of bids in an auction. This integrated framework is based on a single, latent, time-varying construct of consumer willingness to bid, which bidders have and update for a particular auction item over the course of the auction duration. Using a database of notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea, the authors demonstrate that this general (yet parsimonious) model captures the key behavioral aspects of bidding behavior. Furthermore, the authors provide a valuable tool for managers at auction sites to conduct their customer relationship management efforts, which require them to evaluate the ?goodness? of the listed auction items (whether people bid) and the goodness of the potential bidders (who bids, when they bid, and how much they bid).",1
Eliciting Preference for Complex Products: A Web-Based Upgrading Method,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The authors propose a new incentive-aligned upgrading method for eliciting attribute preferences in complex products, which combines the merits of a self-explicated approach and conjoint analysis. The upgrading method first endows a participant with a product profile and then allows him or her to upgrade it, one attribute at a time, to a more desirable product configuration. During the process, the participant states his or her willingness to pay for each potential upgrade he or she is interested in, and a BDM (Becker?DeGroot?Marschak) procedure ensures that it is in the best interest of the participant to state truthfully his or her willingness to pay. Each participant receives the upgraded product at the end of the study. The authors empirically implement this procedure in a Web-based study with digital cameras. This procedure significantly improves predictive performance over the benchmark (self-explicated) approach.",1
Rejectable Choice Sets: How Seemingly Irrelevant No-Choice Options Affect Consumer Decision Processes,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"To date, research on no-choice options has primarily examined the conditions that foster choice deferral, thus focusing on the frequency with which consumers select the no-choice option. In this article, the authors argue that even if the no-choice option is not selected, its mere presence in the choice set may alter consumers' choices. More specifically, they investigate how decision processes and preferences change when consumers have a no-choice option versus when they are forced to choose from a given choice set. They propose that the inclusion of a no-choice option in a choice set affects preferences by leading consumers to determine not only which alternative is best, but which, if any, are acceptable (i.e., meet the consumer's minimum needs). Accordingly, the authors demonstrate that the inclusion of a no-choice option in the choice set (1) leads to more alternative- (rather than attribute-) based information processing, (2) increases the importance of attributes that are more meaningful when alternatives are evaluated one by one (i.e., enriched attributes), and (3) increases the importance of attributes with levels that are closer to the consumer's minimum needs (thresholds). They demonstrate that such changes influence consumers' preference structures and ultimate choices. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological, and managerial implications of these findings.",1
Working It: Managing Professional Brands in Prestigious Posts,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The authors address the challenges individuals face when managing their professional brands while working in ?prestigious posts? (high-profile jobs in established organizations) and striving to maintain career mobility. Using a case study approach and drawing on sociological field theories, the authors identify two types of tensions (resource-based and identity-based) that are triggered by prestigious posts and four practices conducive to mitigating tensions and maintaining mobility. Beyond extending prior theory on person brands to include consideration of career mobility, this work has implications for better understanding the complexities of affiliations between professionals and the brands they work for. It suggests that individuals who are managing their professional brands while holding prestigious posts need to strike a balance between benefiting from the affiliation in the eyes of external stakeholders and at the same time maintaining their professional independence to maintain career mobility.",0
How Do Specialized Personal Incentives Enhance Sales Performance? The Benefits of Steady Sales Growth,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The authors study specialized personal incentives (SPIs), which are cash rewards granted to salespeople for meeting interim performance goals within the regular sales quota period (monthly, quarterly, etc.). Because firms often institute multiple SPIs, the authors are able to investigate whether different sales achievement trajectories have differential impacts on salespeople's period-end sales performance. The authors find that a steadily growing sales trajectory in a sales period is more strongly associated with period-end success than a sales trajectory that is relatively flat early but has a sharp spike later in the period. Furthermore, although salespeople who had high performance in the prior month (i.e., high-performance state) may be able to draw on superior selling strategies (compared with other salespeople), they too experience a boost in sales performance in the current month by earning SPIs. Notably, the authors also find that although earning SPIs benefits all salespeople, there is a U-shaped relationship between a salesperson's performance state and his or her month-end sales performance. For any specific number of SPIs earned, the probability of meeting and exceeding month-end quotas is boosted more for salespeople with low- and high-performance states than for salespeople with a medium-performance state.",0
Aesthetic Incongruity Resolution,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Four studies demonstrate how consumers resolve the aesthetic incongruity that arises between a newly acquired product and the existing consumption environment. The novel insight on which this research is based is that the aesthetic incongruity involving products high in design salience is more likely than aesthetic incongruity involving products low in design salience to be resolved by accommodating the product within the consumption environment, often through additional purchases. Furthermore, the relative presence of frustration versus regret is shown to mediate the relationship between design salience and the decision to buy more.",1
Paywalls: Monetizing Online Content,Journal of Marketing,2018,"In recent years, many news providers have begun monetizing online content through paywalls. While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation. The authors document the sizes of the two externalities for the New York Times paywall and compare them with the direct subscription revenue generated. They comment on implications for newspapers and online content providers that are seeking mechanisms to monetize digital content.",0
A Typology of Service Firms in International Markets: An Empirical Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"Globalization of markets and competition has created unlimited opportunities for marketers of services internationally. Service providers, with a wide range of products ranging from professional services to services embedded with tangible goods, have responded to these opportunities. In view of the limited empirical knowledge of service marketers internationally, this article reports on a study of actual experience in serving international customers. In particular, it proposes a classification framework of services as a means of differentiating various marketing practices. The empirical results confirm, for the first time, the usefulness of this classification framework in generating new insights into both strategic and operational activities of international service marketers. Implications for future research and management are also offered.",0
The Impact of Cultural Values on Marketing Ethical Norms: A Study in India and the United States,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"This research investigates the relationship between the cultural values and the marketing ethics in two diverse countries: India and the United States. The results show that these countries are indeed culturally different, though the gaps have narrowed considerably since Hofstede's (1991) study. Furthermore, the results indicate significant differences in the interpretation of the marketing ethical norms between these two countries. The study concludes with an analysis of how different dimensions of culture influence the different facets of marketing ethical norms for both countries. Such a framework should provide valuable insights that international marketers can use to identify differences in the perception of ethical norms across nationalities and, thus, to design more effective and efficient international marketing and management strategies.",0
Efficient Large-Scale Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"In today's digital market, the number of websites available for advertising has ballooned into the millions. Consequently, firms often turn to ad agencies and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to decide how to allocate their Internet display advertising budgets. Nevertheless, most extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally, this method can accommodate several practical considerations including consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media coverage to matched content websites.",1
Marketing Motives in International Countertrade: An Empirical Examination,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"International countertrade is an unconventional marketing strategy used widely to promote global business transactions. A mail survey involving 108 countertrade practitioners from 23 countries suggests that marketing motives influence the importance of countertrade, frequency of countertrade use, firm-specific longitudinal change in countertrade sales volume, and orientation towards international countertrade.",0
"The Long-Term Effects of Price Promotions on Category Incidence, Brand Choice, and Purchase Quantity",Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"To what extent do price promotions have a long-term effect on the components of brand sales, namely, category incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity? The authors answer this question by using persistence modeling on weekly sales data of a perishable and a storable product derived from a scanner panel. Their analysis reveals, first, that permanent promotion effects are virtually absent for each sales component. Next, the authors develop and apply an impulse response approach to estimate the promotional adjustment period and the total dynamic effects of a price promotion. Specifically, they calculate the long-term equivalent of Gupta's (1988) 14/84/2 breakdown of promotional effects. Because of positive adjustment effects for incidence but negative adjustment effects for choice, the authors find a reversal of the importance of category incidence and brand choice: 66/11/23 for the storable product and 58/39/3 for the perishable product. The authors discuss the implications of the findings and suggest some areas for further research.",1
"New Products, Sales Promotions, and Firm Value: The Case of the Automobile Industry",Journal of Marketing,2004,"Year after year, managers strive to improve financial performance and firm value through marketing actions such as new product introductions and promotional incentives. This study investigates the short- and long-term impact of such marketing actions on financial metrics, including top-line, bottom-line, and stock market performance. The authors apply multivariate time-series models to the automobile industry, in which both new product introductions and promotional incentives are considered important performance drivers. Notably, whereas both marketing actions increase top-line firm performance, their long-term effects strongly differ for the bottom line. First, new product introductions increase long-term financial performance and firm value, but promotions do not. Second, investor reaction to new product introduction grows over time, indicating that useful information unfolds in the first two months after product launch. Third, product entry in a new market yields the highest top-line, bottom-line, and stock market benefits. Managers may use these results to justify new product efforts and to weigh short- and long-term consequences of promotional incentives.",0
Moving from Free to Fee: How Online Firms Market to Change Their Business Model Successfully,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Moving from free to ?free and fee? for any product or service represents a challenge to managers, especially when consumers have plenty of free alternatives. For one online content provider, this article examines (1) the sources of long-term revenue loss (through attracting fewer free subscribers) and (2) how the firm's marketing actions affect its revenue gains (through attracting paid subscribers). The authors quantify revenue loss from several sources, including the direct effects of charging for part of the online content and the reduced effectiveness of search-engine referrals and e-mails. The analysis suggests several managerial implications. Managers should focus their price promotions on stimulating new monthly subscriptions, rather than the current promotional focus on stimulating new yearly contracts. In contrast, e-mail and search-engine referrals appear to be effective at generating yearly subscriptions. Meanwhile, free-to-fee conversion e-mail blasts are a double-edged sword; they increase subscription revenue at the expense of advertising revenue. Finally, further analysis shows that the move was preceded by the buildup of momentum in new free subscriptions, which appears to be beneficial for the move's success. The decomposition and comparison of the sources of revenue loss versus gains reveals several trade-offs facing companies moving from free to free and fee.",0
A Strategy Process Perspective on Export Withdrawal,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This article presents a strategy process study of export withdrawal. An in-depth comparative study of four export withdrawals results in a complex, six-staged strategy process model. The cases illustrate how organizations behave inertially, cope with opposing perspectives, evaluate, and ultimately withdraw. Clear evidence is provided about how and why commitment to an export venture begins to escalate with some managers, whereas others increasingly detach themselves from it. The authors argue that a profound insight into the strategic and organizational dynamics of an international withdrawal fosters a better understanding of the internationalization process of the firm.",0
Decomposing Influence Strategies: Argument Structure and Dependence as Determinants of the Effectiveness of Influence Strategies in Gaining Channel Member Compliance,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Although there is considerable research examining the effects of influence strategies on relational outcomes, research has been silent on the effectiveness of influence strategies in achieving the primary objective: channel member compliance. The authors develop a theoretical model that predicts that noncoercive influence strategies (Rationality, Recommendations, Information Exchange, and Requests) with an argument structure that contains more thorough content result in relatively greater levels of compliance. The model further predicts that coercive influence strategies (Promises and Threats) result in compliance only when target dependence levels are high. The authors develop a new influence strategy, Rationality, which represents a noncoercive strategy with a full argument structure. In general, empirical findings support the theoretical model. However, in contrast to expectations, the use of Recommendations had a negative effect on compliance. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant interaction between trust and Recommendations on compliance, thus providing an explanation for this unexpected result. When trust is low, Recommendation strategies are counterproductive. The authors discuss implications of the findings and directions for further research.",0
A Strategic Framework for Customer Relationship Management,Journal of Marketing,2005,"In this article, the authors develop a conceptual framework for customer relationship management (CRM) that helps broaden the understanding of CRM and its role in enhancing customer value and, as a result, shareholder value. The authors explore definitional aspects of CRM, and they identify three alternative perspectives of CRM. The authors emphasize the need for a cross-functional, process-oriented approach that positions CRM at a strategic level. They identify five key cross-functional CRM processes: a strategy development process, a value creation process, a multichannel integration process, an information management process, and a performance assessment process. They develop a new conceptual framework based on these processes and explore the role and function of each element in the framework. The synthesis of the diverse concepts within the literature on CRM and relationship marketing into a single, process-based framework should provide deeper insight into achieving success with CRM strategy and implementation.",0
Effects of Indirectly and Directly Competing Reference Group Messages and Persuasion Knowledge: Implications for Educational Placements,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Educational placements increasingly appear to replace public service announcements as a means of communication, but their efficacy seems questionable because they contain mixed messages. Two experiments, conducted with 2850 adolescents, test versions of a real television program with an antismoking educational placement against a control program. Typical antismoking programs contain three indirectly competing messages: Smokers are attractive and prevalent but also worthy of disapproval. Experiment 1 tests several program versions with these three messages and reveals that the disapproval message dominates and elicits negative smoker thoughts and beliefs, despite the otherwise potent smoker attractiveness message. Experiment 2 indicates corresponding effects for intent but shows that adding a directly competitive smoker approval message nullifies this effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects among smokers. That is, among smokers, an educational placement is counterattitudinal, so when the epilogue discloses the placement and evokes persuasion knowledge, smokers generate more positive smoker beliefs and intentions. These findings contribute to research regarding competing referent messages, disclosures, and persuasion knowledge.",1
What to Convey in Antismoking Advertisements for Adolescents: The use of Protection Motivation Theory to Identify Effective Message Themes,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Antismoking advertising is increasingly used, but its message content is controversial. In an initial study in which adolescents coded 194 advertisements, the authors identified seven common message themes. Using protection motivation theory, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the message theme effects on cognitions and intentions and test them in an experiment involving 1667 adolescents. Three of the seven message themes increased adolescents? nonsmoking intentions compared with a control; all did so by enhancing adolescents? perceptions that smoking poses severe social disapproval risks. Other message themes increased health risk severity perceptions but were undermined by low perceived vulnerability.",0
To have and to Hold: The Influence of Haptic Information on Product Judgments,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Haptic information, or information attained through touch by the hands, is important for the evaluation of products that vary in terms of material properties related to texture, hardness, temperature, and weight. The authors develop and propose a conceptual framework to illustrate that salience of haptic information differs significantly across products, consumers, and situations. The authors use two experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products. In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information. The authors synthesize the results of these studies and discuss implications for the effect of haptic information for Internet and other nonstore retailing as well as for traditional retailers.",0
Caring for the Commons: Using Psychological Ownership to Enhance Stewardship Behavior for Public Goods,Journal of Marketing,2020,"How can consumers be encouraged to take better care of public goods? Across four studies, including two experiments in the field and three documenting actual behaviors, the authors demonstrate that increasing consumers? individual psychological ownership facilitates stewardship of public goods. This effect occurs because feelings of ownership increase consumers? perceived responsibility, which then leads to active behavior to care for the good. Evidence from a variety of contexts, including a public lake with kayakers, a state park with skiers, and a public walking path, suggests that increasing psychological ownership enhances both effortful stewardship, such as picking up trash from a lake, and financial stewardship, such as donating money. This work further demonstrates that the relationship between psychological ownership and resulting stewardship behavior is attenuated when there are cues, such as an attendance sign, which diffuse responsibility among many people. This work offers implications for consumers, practitioners, and policy makers with simple interventions that can encourage consumers to be better stewards of public goods.",0
It Just Feels Good: Customers? Affective Response to Touch and Its Influence on Persuasion,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Prior research has assumed that touch has a persuasive effect only if it provides attribute or structural information about a product. Under this view, the role of touch as a persuasive tool is limited. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the persuasive influence of touch as an affective tool in the absence of useful product-related information. The authors find that for people who are motivated to touch because it is fun or interesting, a communication that incorporates touch leads to increased affective response and increased persuasion, particularly when the touch provides neutral or positive sensory feedback. People who are not motivated to touch for fun will also be persuaded by a communication that incorporates touch when they are able to make sense of how the touch is related to the message. The authors explore the effectiveness of different types of touch in generating an affective response, and they replicate the effects on attitudes and behavior in a real-world setting. This research suggests that the marketing implications of touch are more substantial than previously believed. The authors present research implications for direct marketing, product packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and print advertising.",0
Learning about Foreign Markets: Are Entrant Firms Exposed to a ?Shock Effect??,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This study addresses how managers? perceived familiarity with local markets develops during a period of entry or expansion. The authors derive different predictions of how foreign-market familiarity changes during periods of entry from the internationalization process literature. They then subject the predictions to an empirical examination, using a data set that covers foreign business operations as reported by managers of international firms from small, open economies (Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand). In addition to addressing these predictions, the empirical study gives insight into the incidence and character of ?shock effects? in foreign-market entries. The effects are evident in managers? inclination to underestimate differences between the home and host countries in terms of business environments. The data support the supposition that, in general, managers of entrant firms experience these shock effects. For example, the authors find the lowest level of market familiarity among managers of entrant firms that are in the eighth year after entry or initiation of foreign-market expansion. The company data indicate that, in general, managers of entrant firms experience shock effects in relation to entry into adjacent but not into distant countries. Thus, the hypothesis of the psychic-distance paradox that the authors put forward is supported. Entrant firms also experience shock effects with respect to the acquisition of tacit rather than explicit knowledge; furthermore, the data suggest that shock effects befall producers of customized products but not producers of standardized products.",0
Good and Guilt-Free: The Role of Self-Accountability in Influencing Preferences for Products with Ethical Attributes,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding self-accountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals.",0
The Commodification of the American West: Marketers? Production of Cultural Meanings at the Trade Show,Journal of Marketing,2000,"The author employs critical ethnographic methods to examine empirically marketers? processes of producing cultural meanings at a western stock show and rodeo. Western cultural meanings and values of freedom, naturalism, competition, and family values are produced by marketers in attracting a nonranch audience; juxtaposing business, education, and entertainment; making ample references to historical tradition; and using business activity as the basis for claims of authenticity. Marketing implications center on tapping into rich sources of cultural meaning by (1) attending to the cultural dimensions of economic activity, (2) taking industry as the unit of analysis through an examination of representations of production in market discourses and practices, (3) expanding history from a research method to a source of market meaning, and (4) considering the marketplace as a lived tradition.",0
Network Overlap and Content Sharing on Social Media Platforms,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Improving content sharing on social media platforms helps firms enhance the efficacy of their marketing campaigns. The authors study the impact of network overlap?the overlap in network connections between two users?on content sharing in directed social media platforms. The authors propose a hazards model that flexibly captures the impact of three measures of network overlap (i.e., common followees, common followers, and common mutual followers) on content sharing. Using data on content sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many others have already shared it. Collectively, these results have a bearing for marketers to more effectively target users for spreading content on social media platforms.",1
The Faces of Success: Beauty and Ugliness Premiums in e-Commerce Platforms,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Given the positive bias toward attractive people in society, online sellers are justifiably apprehensive about perceptions of their profile pictures. Although the existing literature emphasizes the ?beauty premium? and the ?ugliness penalty,? the current studies of seller profile pictures on customer-to-customer e-commerce platforms find a U-shaped relationship between facial attractiveness and product sales (i.e., both beauty and ugliness premiums and, thus, a ?plainness penalty?). By analyzing two large data sets, the authors find that both attractive and unattractive people sell significantly more than plain-looking people. Two online experiments reveal that attractive sellers enjoy greater source credibility due to perceived sociability and competence, whereas unattractive sellers are considered more believable on the basis of their perceived competence. While a beauty premium is apparent for appearance-relevant products, an ugliness premium is more pronounced for expertise-relevant products and for female consumers evaluating male sellers. These findings highlight the influence of facial appearance as a key vehicle for impression formation in online platforms and its complex effects in e-commerce and marketing.",0
Narrowband Influencers and Global Icons: Universality and Media Compatibility in the Communication Patterns of Political Leaders Worldwide,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"This article analyzes how political leaders communicate with their target audiences and examines whether they adopt a country-specific communication persona, or react to the global media-intensive environment by offering more universal communication. Politicians communicate through presentational (e.g., social media) and representational (e.g., press) outlets, and the compatibility between these outlets represents the leader?s effectiveness in transmitting the desired messages to the audience. The authors of this study suggest a theoretical framework that classifies public figures? communication along two dimensions: universality (particular?universal) and media compatibility (low?high). The authors used language processing tools to study the sentiment, topic mixture, and use of pronouns by 61 global world leaders in more than 300,000 messages from the leaders? Twitter accounts and press articles. The results show a high level of universality across political leaders in sentiment, topic mixture, and pronoun usage. The media compatibility is high, with Twitter being slightly more positive. Most leaders fall within the categories of Cosmopolitan Antagonist (high universality, low media compatibility) and Global Icon (high universality, high media compatibility). Overall, the sentiment of their communications is positive. Popular topics include diplomacy, economy, corruption, and the Arab world. No significant relationship was found between the sentiment or communication topics and country characteristics.",0
When to Take or Forgo New Product Exclusivity: Balancing Protection from Competition against Word-of-Mouth Spillover,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Manufacturers or resellers introducing a new product often must decide whether and for how long to be its exclusive seller. Standard models of competition and conventional wisdom suggest that exclusivity boosts profits. However, using both agent-based simulations and game-theoretic modeling, the authors find that positive word of mouth (WOM) from customers of rival firms can make exclusivity unprofitable. This reversal of conventional wisdom occurs because WOM creates a positive externality, and a firm holding exclusivity cannot benefit from the WOM spillover generated by customers of other firms. The benefits of forgoing exclusivity are magnified by (1) the presence of locked-in customers who consider buying from only a single firm, (2) the extent to which opinion leaders are among a firm's own locked-in customers rather than those of competitors, and (3) customers? low price sensitivity. In addition, firms sometimes benefit from forgoing exclusivity even without WOM from rivals? customers, but only when the combination of large-scale lock-in, high price sensitivity, and strong WOM among the firm's customers exists.",0
Lateral Exchange Markets: How Social Platforms Operate in a Networked Economy,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Lateral exchange markets (LEMs) are sites of technologically intermediated exchange between actors occupying equivalent network positions. To develop an enriched understanding of these markets, the authors develop a more broad-based and differentiated understanding of peer-to-peer, sharing, and access-based markets. They focus on two key axes: the extent of (1) consociality and (2) platform intermediation. Drawing on these attributes, the authors theoretically deduce four ideal types?Forums, Enablers, Matchmakers, and Hubs. Each type provides value in a different way: Forums connect actors, Enablers equip actors, Matchmakers pair actors, and Hubs centralize exchange. Twenty organizational cases reveal insights into the failure, adaptation, and success of LEMs. Lateral exchange markets shift responsibility for personal and exchange security to relevant personal actors, to institutions, or to the governing algorithms of technology platforms. Extending the general proposition that sociality increasingly infuses market logics, the findings suggest a new frontier in which social resources and software platform algorithms interact as operand resources whose negative consequences (e.g., opportunism) require careful management through assurances and institutional arrangements matched to the type of LEM operation.",0
Are Product Returns a Necessary Evil? Antecedents and Consequences,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The firm?customer exchange process consists of three key parts: (1) firm-initiated marketing communications, (2) customer buying behavior, and (3) customer product return behavior. To date, the literature in marketing has largely focused on how marketing communications affect customer buying behavior and, to some extent, how past buying behavior affects a firm's decisions to initiate future marketing communications. However, the literature on product returns is sparse, especially in relation to analyzing individual customer product return behavior. Although the magnitude of the value of product returns is known to be high ($100 billion per year), how it affects customer buying behavior is not known because of a lack of data availability and understanding of the role of product returns in the firm?customer exchange process. Given that product returns are considered a hassle for a firm's supply chain management and a drain on overall profitability, it is important to study product return behavior. Thus, the authors empirically demonstrate the role of product returns in the exchange process by determining the exchange process factors that help explain product return behavior and the consequences of product returns on future customer and firm behavior. In addition, the authors demonstrate that product returns are inevitable but by no means evil.",0
"Perceived Risk, Product Returns, and Optimal Resource Allocation: Evidence from a Field Experiment",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Relatively few retailers include metrics such as product returns in their customer selection and optimal resource allocation algorithms when measuring and maximizing customer value. Even when they do include this metric, increases in product return behavior are usually considered merely an economic cost that must be managed by decreasing the marketing resource allocations toward the customers making the returns. However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm?customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months. They find that the firm is able to increase both its short-and long-term profits when accounting for the perceived risk related to product returns in addition to managing product return costs. Furthermore, the authors find that by including this risk, rather than simply implementing traditional customer lifetime value?based models generically, the firm can target more profitable customers.",1
Marketing Communication Strategies and Consumer Financial Decision Making: The Role of National Culture,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Consumers frequently make important financial decisions that have short- and long-term impacts on their welfare. The authors expect that these financial decisions are a function of consumers' past experiences and interactions with a financial services firm as well as consumers' long-term priorities (e.g., national culture). They determine how three cultural dimensions (long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity) and marketing communication type (promotion focused vs. prevention focused) affect three key consumer financial decisions: (1) savings rate, (2) use of credit, and (3) spending pattern. To do so, they empirically test both the direct effect of national culture on consumer financial decision making and its moderating effect on the link between a firm's marketing efforts and consumer financial decision making. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors develop and empirically test their hypotheses using a customer database from a multinational financial services firm based in the United Arab Emirates, with customers originating from 34 countries. They find that national culture directly affects consumer financial decision making and moderates the impact of marketing efforts by the financial services firm, which suggests that financial services firms should account for national culture when managing customers.",0
A Control Function Approach to Endogeneity in Consumer Choice Models,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Endogeneity arises for numerous reasons in models of consumer choice. It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors? approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households? choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.",1
Shaping Customer Satisfaction through Self-Awareness Cues,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Six studies show that subtle contextual cues that increase customers? self-awareness can be used to influence their satisfaction with service providers (while holding the objective service delivery constant). Self-awareness cues tend to increase customers? satisfaction when the outcome of a service interaction is unfavorable, but they tend to decrease customers? satisfaction when the outcome of the interaction is favorable. This is because higher self-awareness increases customers? tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the provider. Self-awareness can even influence satisfaction with service interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store. The results further show that attempts to shape customers? satisfaction by means of self-awareness are more likely to be effective when there is substantial customer responsibility for the outcome; when customers? responsibility is limited, such attempts may backfire.",1
Relaxation Increases Monetary Valuations,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research documents an intriguing empirical phenomenon whereby states of relaxation increase the monetary valuation of products. The authors demonstrate this phenomenon in six experiments involving two methods of inducing relaxation, a large number of products of different types, and various methods of assessing monetary valuation. In all six experiments, participants who were put into a relaxed affective state reported higher monetary valuations than participants who were put into an equally pleasant but less relaxed state. This effect seems to be caused by differences in relaxed and nonrelaxed people's mental construals of the value of the products. Specifically, compared with less relaxed people, relaxed people seem to represent the value of products at a higher level of abstraction, which increases their perceptions of these products' value. The phenomenon appears to reflect an inflation of value by relaxed people rather than a deflation of value by less relaxed people.",1
Search and Alignment in Judgment Revision: Implications for Brand Positioning,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The authors propose a model of judgment revision, which posits that counterattitudinal challenges to a brand initially trigger a memory search for proattitudinal information about the brand. The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge in order to assess the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it ?damages? the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, judgments are revised in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e.g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e.g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information at the time of the challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information.",1
Customer Responses to Switching Costs: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of the Moderating Influence of Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Relationship marketing effectiveness varies across different markets, but prior research has provided limited evidence on how cultural variations relate to the effects of relationship variables such as switching costs. The authors develop and test a theoretical framework that explains how culture moderates the relationship between perceived switching costs and key consequences. The findings of a meta-analysis, based on 451 effect sizes collected in 25 countries, show that similar components that refer to a match between the value essence of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the motivators that steer particular consequences explain how individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity moderate the impact of switching costs on word of mouth of customers and loyalty types. Furthermore, the economic development of a country explains when switching costs either reduce or increase switching of customers. The findings of this study support international companies in making decisions about the generation of switching costs in particular markets and the formation of international relationship marketing and referral programs.",0
Consequences of Sales Management's Behavior- and Compensation-Based Control Strategies in Developing Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"The authors examine the consequences of sales management's behavior- and compensation-based control on important salesperson and organizational consequences from the sales manager's perspective. The few existing studies on this topic have been conducted in developed countries. The authors examine sales management control in three less developed countries: Greece, India, and Malaysia. The conceptual model considers the relationships among behavior-based control, compensation control, satisfaction with sales territory design, salesperson behavior and outcome performance, and sales unit effectiveness. Contrary to the prevailing conceptual logic, the findings from less developed countries provide no support that a combination of high levels of both behavior- and compensation-based control have a negative, conflicting impact on salesperson and organization consequences. The findings have several important implications for decisions about international sales operations.",0
"Attention Capture and Transfer in Advertising: Brand, Pictorial, and Text-Size Effects",Journal of Marketing,2004,"The three key ad elements (brand, pictorial, and text) each have unique superiority effects on attention to advertisements, which are on par with many commonly held ideas in marketing practice. This is the main conclusion of an analysis of 1363 print advertisements tested with infrared eye-tracking methodology on more than 3600 consumers. The pictorial is superior in capturing attention, independent of its size. The text element best captures attention in direct proportion to its surface size. The brand element most effectively transfers attention to the other elements. Only increments in the text element's surface size produce a net gain in attention to the advertisement as a whole. The authors discuss how their findings can be used to render more effective decisions in advertising.",0
The Stopping Power of Advertising: Measures and Effects of Visual Complexity,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Advertising needs to capture consumers? attention in likable ways, and the visual complexity of advertising plays a central role in this regard. Yet ideas about visual complexity effects conflict, and objective measures of complexity are rare. The authors distinguish two types of visual complexity, differentiate them from the difficulty of comprehending advertising, and propose objective measures for each. Advertisements are visually complex when they contain dense perceptual features (?feature complexity?) and/or when they have an elaborate creative design (?design complexity?). An analysis of 249 advertisements that were tested with eye-tracking shows that, as the authors hypothesize, feature complexity hurts attention to the brand and attitude toward the ad, whereas design complexity helps attention to both the pictorial and the advertisement as a whole, its comprehensibility, and attitude toward the ad. This is important because design complexity is under direct control of the advertiser. The proposed measures can be readily adopted to assess the visual complexity of advertising, and the findings can be used to improve the stopping power of advertisements.",0
"Consumer Neuroscience: Applications, Challenges, and Possible Solutions",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The first decade of consumer neuroscience research has produced groundbreaking work in identifying the basic neural processes underlying human judgment and decision making, with the majority of such studies published in neuroscience journals and influencing models of brain function. Yet for the field of consumer neuroscience to thrive in the next decade, the current emphasis on basic science research must be extended into marketing theory and practice. The authors suggest five concrete ways that neuroscientific methods can be fruitfully applied to marketing. They then outline three fundamental challenges facing consumer neuroscientists and offer potential solutions for addressing them. The authors conclude by describing how consumer neuroscience can become an important complement to research and practice in marketing.",1
Individual Differences in Marketing Placebo Effects: Evidence from Brain Imaging and Behavioral Experiments,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"A wealth of research has explored whether marketing-based expectancies such as price and brand quality beliefs influence the consumption experience and subsequent behavior, but almost no research has examined individual differences in ?marketing placebo effects.? In this article, the authors suggest three moderators of the effect of marketing-based expectancies on the behavioral and neural measures of the consumption experience, based on previous findings from neuroscientific literature investigating traditional clinical pain placebo effects. They use a novel automated structural brain imaging approach to determine individual differences and combine this approach with traditional behavioral experiments. The findings show that consumers high in reward seeking, low in somatosensory awareness, and high in need for cognition are more responsive to marketing placebo effects.",1
"Does the Customer Matter Most? Exploring Strategic Frontline Employees? Influence of Customers, the Internal Business Team, and External Business Partners",Journal of Marketing,2016,"Marketing relationships have evolved from simple dyadic transactions between the firm and its customers into scenarios in which the firm's frontline employees are required to manage a portfolio of stakeholder relationships. The authors begin by characterizing the ?strategic? frontline employee (SFLE) as a focal marketing employee who, in the execution of his or her work, must influence a variety of stakeholder target groups, including (1) customers, (2) the internal business team, and (3) external business partners. The authors leverage data from SFLEs at two firms to explore the similarities and differences in SFLE influence tactic effectiveness across the three stakeholder groups. They find that the effectiveness of influence tactics in driving performance differs across stakeholder target types and, somewhat surprisingly, that the SFLE's influence of both the internal business team and external business partners has a greater effect on his or her performance than does influence directed at customers. The authors close with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice.",0
Deciding without Resources: Resource Depletion and Choice in Context,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Although choices can occur after careful deliberation, many everyday choices are usually effortless and are guided by intuitive thinking. This research examines the implications of the interplay between these two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to a single underlying resource used for self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context. Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation activities but rather extends to choice in general.",1
Making Products Feel Special: When Metacognitive Difficulty Enhances Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"More than 200 studies suggest that metacognitive difficulty reduces the liking of an object. In contrast to those findings, the authors demonstrate that the effects of metacognitive experiences on evaluation are sensitive to the consumption domain. In the domain of everyday goods, metacognitive difficulty reduces the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unfamiliar. However, in the context of special-occasion products, for which consumers value exclusivity, metacognitive difficulty increases the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unique or uncommon. The authors reconcile their findings with prior research by positing that the effect of metacognitive experiences on evaluation depends on the naive theory people associate with product consumption. Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect and test for the role of lay theories in the interpretation of metacognitive experiences. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical and marketing implications.",1
How Images of Other Consumers Influence Subsequent Taste Perceptions,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Images of food are seemingly everywhere, and yet the influence that such images have on important consumer outcomes is not well understood. The authors propose that the effect that image exposure has on taste perceptions largely depends on the interaction between the type of food (healthy vs. unhealthy) and whether the image shows the food alone (food image) or the food being consumed by a person (consummatory image). Specifically, the authors show that exposure to consummatory images of unhealthy (vs. healthy) foods increases taste perceptions relative to food images. To explain this effect, the authors argue that seeing an image of someone else indulging in an unhealthy food serves as social proof of the appropriateness and acceptability of indulgent consumption. As such, images of consumers eating act as a justification agent for real consumers, thereby reducing the conflict associated with the subsequent indulgent consumption experience and, in effect, increasing taste perceptions. The authors test this effect across five studies and eliminate rival explanations pertaining to emotional contagion, goal contagion, and source attractiveness.",0
Factors Affecting the Adoption of Market Orientation: The Case of Thailand,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Recently, there has been a renewed interest in market orientation or the implementation of the marketing concept by marketing professionals. This study addresses the issue from the foreign manager's perspective?specifically, the conceptual model of factors affecting the manager's decision to adopt the orientation is proposed and empirically tested. Findings show that the foreign manager's intention to adopt the orientation is positively affected by attitude toward market orientation and attitude toward innovation in management orientation. Attitude toward market orientation is, in turn, affected by the manager's beliefs regarding the relative advantage of market orientation, market turbulence, competitive intensity, and attitude toward innovation in management orientation. Attitude toward innovation in management orientation is, on the other hand, positively affected by the manager's innovativeness and negatively affected by opinion leadership. Theoretical contributions, managerial implications, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed.",0
Merely Being with you Increases My Attention to Luxury Products: Using EEG to Understand Consumers? Emotional Experience with Luxury Branded Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Electrophysiological and hemodynamic studies provide substantial evidence of dissimilar brain responses when people view emotional compared with neutral pictures. This study investigates consumer brain responses underpinning passive viewing of luxury (high emotional value) versus basic (low emotional value) branded products when participants are alone or with another person. Conforming to social facilitation theory and using electroencephalogram methods, the authors recorded event-related potentials while female participants passively viewed pictures of luxury and basic branded products. They examined event-related-potential amplitudes in three time windows, corresponding to the P2 and P3 components and the late positive potential (LPP). Dissimilar brain responses occurred in the Together but not the Alone condition for the P2 and P3 components over visual cortex sites. The LPP amplitude was higher for luxury than for basic branded products, but only in the Together condition, suggesting that the presence of another person magnifies the emotional effect of brand type. Taken together, the results suggest that LPP amplitude during passive viewing of relevant marketing images reflects increased attention allocation and motivational significance, both enhanced by the presence of another person, to stimuli with higher emotional value.",1
Signaling Strategies in Competitive Interaction: Building Reputations and Hiding the Truth,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors develop a conceptual framework of how managers interpret competitors' signals over time in various market contexts. From the framework, the authors generate hypotheses about the relative effectiveness of signaling strategies used by firms in different market contexts. The authors conducted two empirical studies involving a repeated entry-pricing game to test the hypotheses. The results of Study 1 show that the entrant's perceptions of the aggressiveness of the incumbent depend on the focus and strength of the incumbent's signals. The results of Study 2 show that the strength of the entrant's responses to the incumbent's signals depends on the incumbent's use of bluffs and the cost of information about the factors driving the incumbent's signals. The implications of these findings for how firms should signal to achieve such strategic objectives as revealing or concealing information, developing a desired reputation, and influencing competitors' responses over time are discussed. The authors conclude by discussing the limitations of the article and its implications for further research.",1
"The Impact of Acquisitions on Innovation: Poison Pill, Placebo, or Tonic?",Journal of Marketing,2005,"Do acquisitions increase, decrease, or have no effect on innovation? The empirical research on this question suggests that acquisitions may hurt innovation; that is, they may be a ?poison pill? for innovation. The authors present an alternative view. For firms that first engage in internal knowledge development, the knowledge-based view the authors present suggests that acquisitions can help innovation; that is, they can be a tonic for innovation. Analysis of cross-sectional, time-series data on a sample of pharmaceutical firms during 1988?97 provides evidence to support the thesis.",0
Perspectives and Preparedness regarding ISO-9000 International Quality Standards,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"With increasing globalization of trade, and growing reliance on quality as a competitive weapon, the ISO-9000 international quality standards have become a major force to be reckoned with for U.S. companies doing business directly or indirectly with the European Community or any of the 50 countries that have adopted the standards. While much attention has been focused on the efforts of large companies in achieving ISO-9000 registration, little is known about the awareness, attitudes, concerns, and preparedness of small and medium-sized manufacturers in regard to ISO-9000. Based on a large-scale survey, this article provides insights into the stages and correlates of preparedness for ISO-9000, and also into major perceived barriers to achieving certification among small and medium-sized manufacturers. Important implications for management and public policy are discussed.",0
The Influence of Internet?Marketing Integration on Marketing Competencies and Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Internet technology is often considered to be fundamentally changing the business paradigm and increasingly integrated into the marketing function. The authors offer a conceptual model linking market orientation, marketing competencies, and export performance and investigate the role of the Internet technology in these relationships. On the basis of an analysis of survey data from 381 manufacturing firms involved in exporting, the authors find that firms' integration of Internet technology into marketing activities generally leverages the influence of market orientation on the firms' marketing competencies (compared with competitors), which in turn have a positive impact on their export performance. The authors identify competitive intensity, firm size, and degree of export dependence as additional moderating variables.",0
Rebuilding the Boat While Staying Afloat: The Modeling Challenge for Behavioral Economics,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The author comments on the article by Ho, Lim, and Camerer (2006), which showcases the potential of the new behavioral economics approach to marketing with six theoretical ?case studies.? Each case study describes a new model of consumer behavior or competitive marketing interactions. The author raises two general questions about such models. The first question is whether behavioral economics is, in reality, a new form of theoretical psychology, competing with existing psychological models and theories and subject to the same vulnerability to evidence as applies to psychological theory. The author argues that behavioral economists are ambivalent about this point, sometimes claiming psychological realism or plausibility as a necessary modeling requirement and other times introducing assumptions for modeling convenience. The second question is whether the impact of behavioral economics on marketing will be experienced more strongly through the development of new quantitative models or through the exploration of qualitative lessons stimulated by behavioral violations of rationality. It is argued that behavioral economics not only contributes new modeling instruments but, through its documentation of rationality violations or ?anomalies,? can provide a rich source of intuitions and insights into consumer psychology as well.",1
Ideological Challenges to Changing Strategic Orientation in Commodity Agriculture,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Why do some firms not change their strategic orientation despite economic incentives to do so? Most current literature on changing strategic orientations has focused on an antecedents and outcomes approach to business orientations. Intimated, but rarely addressed, are the notions that (1) strategic orientations may be thought of as ideologies and (2) such ideologies are likely to contend with each other. Taking such a perspective may be helpful in discussing why it is challenging to transition to more sustainable strategic orientations even in the presence of financial incentives to do so. In assessing the transition to organic production and marketing in a commodity agriculture context, the authors find that contending ideologies restrict its adoption. In addition, they suggest that strategic orientations are not adopted or contested solely within firms but also among them. The authors find that ideological contestation among firms in this context takes the form of a marketplace drama between a chemical, productionist orientation and an organic orientation in which protagonists mobilize several forms of legitimacy.",0
Marketing Communication Drivers of Adoption Timing of a New E-Service among Existing Customers,Journal of Marketing,2007,"This study investigates the effects of direct marketing communications and mass marketing communications on the adoption timing of a new e-service among existing customers. The mass marketing communications pertain to both specific new service advertising and brand advertising from both the focal supplier and the competitors. Using a split-hazard approach, the authors determine the effects of the considered marketing communications on adoption timing, accounting for a significant part of the customer base that never adopts the new e-service. They analyze individual adoption behavior with a sample of 6000 customers of a Dutch telecommunications operator over 25 months. The empirical results show that service advertising shortens the time to adoption, even when it is initiated by competitors. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of the interaction effects between relationship characteristics and marketing efforts suggests that certain mass marketing efforts have a greater effect on loyal customers.",0
Consumers? Response to Commercials: When the Energy Level in the Commercial Conflicts with the Media Context,Journal of Marketing,2015,"This research examines how media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness induced by a movie) find it more difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e.g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a meta-analysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50% more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials.",0
Individual Differences in Brand Schematicity,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Brand schematicity refers to a generalized consumer predisposition to process information using brand schema. This research uses schema theory to build the theoretical groundwork for brand schematicity and reports seven studies conducted to measure, validate, and establish the nature of the construct. Studies 1 and 2 pertain to a scale developed to measure brand schematicity, Study 3 measures the construct using response times, and Study 4 situates the construct in a nomological network of associated constructs. Studies 5 and 6 test the predictive validity of the brand schematicity construct, and Study 7 uses memory clustering to provide evidence of the schematic nature of the construct that represents an inherent difference in the way consumers organize and utilize brand information. These investigations establish the validity of brand schematicity and its associated scale, as well as reveal that brand schematicity influences the role of brand concept consistency in brand extension evaluations, suggesting the possible moderating role of the construct in a wide variety of brand-related relationships.",1
Brand Dilution: When Do New Brands Hurt Existing Brands?,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Potential for trademark dilution occurs when a new brand introduces itself with an identical or substantially similar mark to that of an existing brand. Currently, there is neither a clear standard for legal proof of dilution nor widely accepted measures for managerial use. Using a shared-brand-network model, the authors use three different but conceptually related measurement methodologies (response latency, aided recall, and simulated choice) across five experiments to examine ?blurring? dilution effects. The results suggest that when junior brands operate in similar categories and position on similar attributes, there is no immediate threat of blurring dilution. However, if the junior brand chooses to position on dissimilar attributes in a similar category, dilution of attribute associations is likely. When the junior brand operates in dissimilar categories, there is a threat of blurring dilution for both category and attribute associations. The final two studies demonstrate that dilution of junior brands (i.e., operating in dissimilar categories positioned on dissimilar attributes) can suppress consideration and choice probabilities for the senior brand and that this effect may extend over a period of time.",0
Consumers and Artificial Intelligence: An Experiential Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations? investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.",0
Gender Identity Salience and Perceived Vulnerability to Breast Cancer,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Breast cancer communications that make women's gender identity salient can trigger defense mechanisms and thereby interfere with key objectives of breast cancer campaigns. In a series of experiments, the authors demonstrate that increased gender identity salience lowered women's perceived vulnerability to breast cancer (Experiments 1a, 3a, and 3b), reduced their donations to ovarian cancer research (Experiment 1b), made breast cancer advertisements more difficult to process (Experiment 2a), and decreased ad memory (Experiment 2b). These results are contrary to the predictions of several prominent theoretical perspectives and a convenience sample of practitioners. The reduction in perceived vulnerability to breast cancer following gender identity primes can be eliminated by self-affirmation (Experiment 3a) and fear voicing (Experiment 3b), corroborating the hypothesis that these effects are driven by unconscious defense mechanisms.",1
Social Context and Advertising Memory,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article examines the influence of the presence of others on advertising memory. The authors take an intrapsychic perspective on social desirability and propose that the presence of others??in the absence of direct interaction??leads to the automatic activation of a concern with the impression others are forming. They find that words applicable to social desirability are accessed faster when respondents are in the presence of another person than when they are alone. Across three experiments, semantic (but not perceptual) memory for words and advertisements applicable to social desirability is greater than that for neutral cues after respondents are exposed to these in the actual or imagined presence of others than when they are alone. Respondents' chronic impression management tendencies (self-monitoring) moderate the effects, suggesting that the effects are, at least in part, determined by motivational factors. This novel theoretical framework provides direct implications for advertisers and marketing researchers who rely on recall memory as one of the most common measures of advertising effectiveness.",1
?Yes/No/Not Right Now?: Yes/No Response Formats Can Increase Response Rates Even in Non-Forced-Choice Settings,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Although yes/no response formats have been used to increase enrollment rates in several different types of programs, their effectiveness has generally been tested in forced-choice settings. The effects on postchoice engagement have not been measured. Across two field experiments in an e-mail context in which choice is not forced, the authors demonstrate a substantial advantage in click-through rates for a yes/no response format over traditional opt-in response formats. The increase in click-through rate does, under certain conditions, also persist through downstream program enrollment and participation. Finally, though noting that the yes/no format advantage is probably multidetermined, the authors discuss several potential psychological mechanisms, which are particularly relevant in non-forced-choice settings. The authors also discuss how the yes/no response format might operate in other settings, such as the implementation of mandated choice for organ donation.",1
An Empirical Analysis of Firms' Product Line Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Despite the importance of product line management as a competitive tool, empirical research addressing the determinants of firm product line decisions is sparse. In this article, the authors propose and empirically estimate a descriptive model of firm product line decisions in the personal computer industry over the period 1981-92. The model incorporates the firm's initial choice of the direction of a product line change (i.e., the product line can be expanded, contracted, or maintained) and the conditional choice related to the magnitude of any product line change (i.e., how many products to introduce or withdraw). The authors show that there are important substantive insights to be gained by analyzing the product line decision in this fashion. In the personal computer industry, for example, firms expand their product lines when industry barriers are low or market opportunities are perceived to exist. High market share firms aggressively expand their product lines, as do firms with relatively high prices or short product lines. In general, the results highlight the various internal and external factors that influence firms' management of their product lines.",1
Should Anthropomorphized Brands Engage Customers? The Impact of Social Crowding on Brand Preferences,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Anthropomorphizing a brand (i.e., imbuing a brand with humanlike features) serves as an important brand positioning strategy for marketing managers. This research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy?positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not. Managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context. However, given that consumers often experience brands in a social context, this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences. Specifically, the authors show that consumers? inferences of an anthropomorphized brand's intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal, thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand. The authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding (goal-related vs. goal-unrelated). In particular, a goal-related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions, which, in turn, leads to greater preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies. In contrast, the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal-unrelated crowded settings.",0
When Humanizing Brands Goes Wrong: The Detrimental Effect of Brand Anthropomorphization amid Product Wrongdoings,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The brand relationship literature shows that the humanizing of brands and products generates more favorable consumer attitudes and thus enhances brand performance. However, the authors propose negative downstream consequences of brand humanization; that is, the anthropomorphization of a brand can negatively affect consumers? brand evaluations when the brand faces negative publicity caused by product wrongdoings. They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity. Finally, the authors explore three firm response strategies (i.e., denial, apology, and compensation) that can affect the evaluations of anthropomorphized brands for consumers with different implicit theory perspectives. They find that entity theorists have more difficulty in combating the adverse effects of brand anthropomorphization than incremental theorists. Furthermore, they demonstrate that compensation (vs. denial or apology) is the only effective response among entity theorists.",0
"Positive Affect, Intertemporal Choice, and Levels of Thinking: Increasing Consumers' Willingness to Wait",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Six studies examine the influence of positive affect on self-control in intertemporal choice (consumers' willingness to wait for desired rewards) and the cognitive processes underlying this effect. Two studies measure participants' levels of thinking in two different ways, showing that positive affect can promote forward-looking, high-level thinking. Two studies using a delay-of-gratification paradigm demonstrate this forward-looking thinking and show it to be a mindful process. Participants in positive (vs. neutral) affect were more likely to choose a larger mail-in rebate over a smaller instant rebate when the reward differences were moderate (but not when they were small). Two studies demonstrate the impact of positive affect on intertemporal preference in another way, showing that participants in positive affect do not discount the value of delayed outcomes as much as people in neutral affect do (decreased present bias). Together, the results indicate that positive affect promotes cognitive flexibility and fosters a higher level of thinking and a more future-oriented time perspective, without obscuring practical considerations and other needed detail, including context and opportunity costs, when evaluating intertemporal options.",1
Product Diversification and Market Value of Large International Firms: A Macroenvironmental Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Drawing on a strategic fit perspective in international marketing, this study explores how macroenvironmental factors?cultural dimensions and globalization forces?affect the relationship between product diversification and market value of large international firms. The author hypothesizes that (1) the four dimensions of culture (individualism?collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity?femininity) significantly affect product diversification and (2) economic and social globalization positively moderate the relationship between product diversification and market value of large international firms. The author empirically examines the hypothesized relationships using a sample of 485 firm-year observations from 17 countries for the period between 2006 and 2009. Using the hierarchical linear modeling technique, the author demonstrates that firms in countries with cultures characterized by high uncertainty avoidance and low power distance have a higher degree of product diversification, and product diversification in turn has a significant positive impact on firm market value. Furthermore, the author demonstrates that economic and social globalization, as indicated by actual flows, personal contacts, and information flows, positively moderates the relationship between product diversification and market value of large international firms.",0
The Market Valuation of Outsourcing New Product Development,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Firms are increasingly outsourcing new product development (NPD), yet little is known about the financial performance implications of this decision. An empirical test shows that there is considerable variation in the performance implications of NPD outsourcing. The authors develop a contingency framework to explain when taking a minority equity participation in the outsourcing provider versus selecting a provider to whom the outsourcing firm has outsourced NPD in the past (i.e., prior tie selection) may increase the outsourcing firm's performance. They find that the superior governance mechanism depends on two forms of uncertainty: technological uncertainty and cultural uncertainty.",1
Ratios in Proportion: What Should the Shape of the Package Be?,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Consumers? reactions to rectangles have implications for package and product design. In two lab studies and an analysis of field data, the authors find that the ratio of the sides of a rectangular product or package can influence purchase intentions and preferences and is related to marketplace demand. In more exploratory inquiries, the authors also find that the impact of this ratio on consumers depends on the relative seriousness of the context in which the product is used. Furthermore, ratio can also affect product perceptions, and consumers appear to prefer a range of contiguous ratios for different contexts rather than a particular ratio.",0
Is Happiness Shared Doubled and Sadness Shared Halved? Social Influence on Enjoyment of Hedonic Experiences,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Because many hedonic stimuli (e.g., movies, vacations, food) are often consumed in the company of other people, it is important to know how social influence affects the enjoyment of shared experiences. Extrapolation from informational and normative influences suggests that enjoyment is enhanced when others offer positive opinions and diminished when they offer negative opinions about shared stimuli. In this article, the authors propose an alternative model. Building on the need to belong and the need for accuracy, the authors predict that enjoyment from sharing stimuli depends on consumers' perceived interpersonal agreements about the shared stimuli, such that congruence of opinions enhances and incongruence of opinions diminishes the enjoyment of the shared experience. The results from three experiments support the authors' predictions and indicate that under some circumstances, social influence can operate in opposite directions on judgments of shared stimuli and on the enjoyment of sharing them.",1
"The Unhealthy = Tasty Intuition and Its Effects on Taste Inferences, Enjoyment, and Choice of Food Products",Journal of Marketing,2006,"Across four experiments, the authors find that when information pertaining to the assessment of the healthiness of food items is provided, the less healthy the item is portrayed to be, (1) the better is its inferred taste, (2) the more it is enjoyed during actual consumption, and (3) the greater is the preference for it in choice tasks when a hedonic goal is more (versus less) salient. The authors obtain these effects both among consumers who report that they believe that healthiness and tastiness are negatively correlated and, to a lesser degree, among those who do not report such a belief. The authors also provide evidence that the association between the concepts of ?unhealthy? and ?tasty? operates at an implicit level. The authors discuss possibilities for controlling the effect of the unhealthy = tasty intuition (and its potential for causing negative health consequences), including controlling the volume of unhealthy but tasty food eaten, changing unhealthy foods to make them less unhealthy but still tasty, and providing consumers with better information about what constitutes ?healthy.?",0
"Marketing Healthful Eating to Children: The Effectiveness of Incentives, Pledges, and Competitions",Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research examines how school administrators can motivate children to make more healthful food choices using incentives, pledges, and competitions as interventions. A six-month field study was conducted across 55 elementary and middle schools, and the authors analyzed the data using a two-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model. All three interventions increased the choice of fruits and vegetables (the proportion of children choosing additional servings increased 3 to 24 percentage points) ten weeks after the interventions ended. However, younger (Grades 1 and 2) and older (Grades 3?8) children responded differently to the interventions. Although both younger and older children responded more favorably to the competition intervention than to the pledge or incentive interventions, the effects of the competition and incentive interventions were more pronounced among the younger children. A second field study, also with schoolchildren, examined the role of pledge reminders on adherence to the pledge. The presence of a visible reminder of a pledge resulted in significantly better outcomes than no reminder of a pledge.",0
The Effect of Sales Promotions on the Size and Composition of the Shopping Basket: Regulatory Compatibility from Framing and Temporal Restrictions,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Most literature on sales promotions focuses on responses to the promoted brand. Across two experimental studies and one field study, the authors examine how sales promotions may affect the size and composition of the overall shopping basket. The authors show that the framing of the savings message on sales promotions (e.g., ?Save $x? versus ?Get $x Off?), the expiration date restriction cue (immediate versus future expiration), and the familiarity of brands (well-known versus less familiar) are independent primes of regulatory focus. Furthermore, such cues, when compatible with one another or with a prior regulatory focus, lead to more unrelated purchases in the store. The authors discuss the findings in the context of theory on regulatory relevance and mind-sets, and they posit managerial implications for the design of sales promotions and store positioning.",1
Time-Varying Effects of Chronic Hedonic Goals on Impulsive Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Marketers and academics have long been interested in understanding what drives impulsive behavior and have focused on what causes a person to indulge. The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals, particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals, leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn, this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic goals. The results have public policy implications for behaviors such as binge drinking and unrestrained eating.",1
Interaction Orientation and Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Marketing managers are being required to demonstrate the profitability of their marketing actions down to the level of their individual customers and on an ongoing basis. At the same time, customers expect firms to increasingly customize their products and services to meet their demands. Firms still need to produce superior products, sell smarter, and understand the markets as a whole, but the ability of firms to orient themselves to interact successfully with their individual customers will differentiate them in the future. Advances in technology have resulted in increasing opportunities for interactions between firms and customers, between customers, and between firms. An interaction orientation reflects a firm's ability to interact with its individual customers and to take advantage of information obtained from them through successive interactions to achieve profitable customer relationships. First, the authors identify the components of interaction orientation: (1) customer concept, (2) interaction response capacity, (3) customer empowerment, and (4) customer value management. Second, they relate interaction orientation to both customer-level and aggregate-level performance measures. Third, they identify the antecedents of interaction orientation. Fourth, they examine the moderating effects of customer-initiated contacts and competitive intensity on the interaction orientation?performance linkage. The results are based on a survey of top marketing managers. The commonly held view that customer-based relational performance is related to customer-based profit performance is not supported. However, both customer-based relational performance and customer-based profit performance affect aggregate business-level performance positively. Interaction orientation is a phenomenon observed in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer firms. The extent of customer-initiated contacts moderates the interaction orientation?performance relationship.",0
Effects of Liberalization on Incumbent Firms? Marketing-Mix Responses and Performance: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Many markets are liberalizing by opening up their economies to foreign competition, with the expectation that this will increase economic growth. While foreign competitors with superior technology and management practices pose serious threats to incumbent firms, they also provide them an opportunity to gain new marketing knowledge. How do incumbent firms respond to liberalization? Can incumbent firms? marketing-mix responses affect their performance following liberalization? Addressing these questions, the authors examine incumbent firms? marketing-mix responses to liberalization and the impact of these responses on performance, using the quasi-experiment of liberalization reforms in India. Estimation results from a panel of 3,927 firms in the period 1989?2000 suggest that while all incumbent firms intensified their product and promotions in response to liberalization, only incumbent firms with greater domestic market knowledge intensified their advertising and distribution responses. Furthermore, incumbent firms? marketing-mix responses significantly affect their performance outcomes. The research?s findings extend theory and provide practical guidelines on how incumbent firms can design marketing-mix responses to liberalization to improve performance.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of Merit Pay Fairness for Industrial Salespeople,Journal of Marketing,2003,"How do salespeople make judgments of merit pay fairness? By what mechanisms do fairness judgments influence the performance and commitment of salespeople? Using equity and social exchange theories, the authors examine these questions for industrial salespeople who work in a Fortune 500 firm and provide four key findings. First, of the three dimensions of fairness judgments, they find the interactional fairness dimension to be relatively more important than procedural or distributive fairness in influencing job outcomes of salespeople. Second, supervisory behaviors have significant influence in shaping salespeople's fairness judgments, particularly judgments of distributive and interactional fairness. Third, the results underscore the contrasting mediating role of trust in supervisor and job satisfaction. Although trust in the supervisor is important in reducing salespeople's opportunistic behaviors, the authors find job satisfaction to be important in enhancing their loyalty to the organization. Fourth, salespeople's job performance is influenced directly by extrinsic factors such as fairness of current rewards and potential for rewards. In addition, the authors outline implications for theory and practice.",0
Offerings as Digitalized Interactive Platforms: A Conceptual Framework and Implications,Journal of Marketing,2018,"In an age of digitalized interactions, offerings are no longer ?finished? in the traditional sense; creation of value continues by engaging actors (often consumers and their associated social networks) interacting with organizing actors (often firms and their associated organizational ecosystem) in a joint space of interactive system-environments. One can think of the Apple Watch NikePlus (AWNP) offering in which the consumer co-creates valuable experienced outcomes with a mix of applications, touchpoints, and uses, while AWNP and its organizing actors co-create environments with consumers. Actors increasingly find themselves in such a joint enactment of interactional value creation, through offerings as evolving digitalized networked arrangements of artifacts, persons, processes, and interfaces, which the authors refer to as a Digitalized Interactive Platform (DIP). This implies a broader view of value creation?one in which value is created through interactions, versus one where value is simply the exchange of a fixed offering between a firm and its customers. Offerings as DIPs have significant implications for the theory and practice of marketing.",0
Demand for ?Healthy? Products: False Claims and FTC Regulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Firms sometimes make selective or deceptive claims, which can have negative consequences for consumers, especially if consumers are not fully informed and the claims are hard to verify. This study aims to measure the decline in demand that a firm making such claims faces when caught. In addition, it seeks to understand which type of consumer these claims primarily affect. Using a panel data set of consumer purchases and firm advertising, the authors measure this impact by exploiting the fact that four popular products settled charges raised by the Federal Trade Commission. They further control for and document firm responses in terms of price and advertisement changes around the date of the settlement. Findings indicate a significant decline in demand following the termination of the claims, resulting in a 12%?67% monthly loss in revenue across the four products, which amounts to a $.40 million?$3.82 million loss in monthly revenue. They also find that these claims primarily affect consumers who are newcomers.",1
"Marketing Initiatives, Expected Cash Flows, and Shareholders? Wealth",Journal of Marketing,2008,"It is widely accepted that marketing initiatives help firms acquire and retain customers. However, the link between the cash flows generated by customers? purchases and shareholders? wealth is not fully understood, and the literature is increasingly advocating the need for greater ?marketing accountability.? In this interdisciplinary research, the authors adapt the theory of firm valuation from finance and show that a marketing action can affect the shareholders? wealth by (1) determining the firm's net present value (the ?stock price effect?) and (2) potentially reducing the firm's cash needs (the ?released working capital effect?). In demonstrating these results, the authors advance marketing theory by answering calls made in the literature to link marketing actions to the investors? cash flows, the firm's working capital needs, and the owners? wealth. The approach also shows that by reducing the firm's cash needs, marketing can increase the firm's productivity (operating efficiency). This imputes a critically important role for marketing. By increasing productivity, marketing can increase the firm's competitive posture and, thus, its long-term viability.",0
The Fruits of Legitimacy: Why Some New Ventures Gain more from Innovation than Others,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article examines rewards to product introduction by new ventures. The authors argue that the new ventures that gain the most from innovation are those that adopt strategies that give them legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders. New ventures can gain legitimacy by creating associations with established entities; such associations can be internal or external to the firm. The authors test these ideas by examining the stock market gains of all products introduced between 1982 and 2002 by all public firms in the U.S. biotechnology industry. The results show that new ventures that acquire legitimacy externally by forming alliances with established firms gain more from their new products than new ventures that do not form such alliances. Among new ventures that do not form alliances, those that acquire legitimacy internally by creating a history of product launches or by hiring reputed executives or scientists gain more from their new products than those that do not. In relative terms, it pays more to have introduced a new drug before than to have a reputed executive on the firm's board; in turn, adding a reputed executive pays more than adding a reputed scientist to the firm's board. Finally, although new ventures can gain from either external or internal legitimacy, pursuit of external legitimacy by firms that already have internal legitimacy leads to lower rewards to innovation.",0
How is Manifest Branding Strategy Related to the Intangible Value of a Corporation?,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Firms exhibit or ?manifest? three types of branding strategies: corporate branding, house of brands, or mixed branding. These strategies differ in their essential structure and in their potential costs and benefits to the firm. Prior research has failed to understand how these branding strategies are related to the intangible value of the firm. The authors investigate this relationship using five-year data for a sample of 113 U.S. firms. They find that corporate branding strategy is associated with higher values of Tobin's q, and mixed branding strategy is associated with lower values of Tobin's q, after controlling for the effects of several important and relevant factors. The relationships of the control variables are consistent with prior expectations. In addition, most of the firms would have been able to improve their Tobin's q had they adopted a branding strategy different from the one their brand portfolios revealed. The authors also discuss implications and future research directions.",0
The Impact of the Internet on Information Search for Automobiles,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Using data from surveys of automobile buyers collected in 1990 and 2000 in a natural experiment setting, the authors study the determinants of use of the Internet as a source of information on automobiles, its impact on the use of other sources, and its impact on total search effort. The results indicate that the Internet draws attention in approximately the same proportion from other sources. The results also show that those who use the Internet to search for automobiles are younger and more educated and search more in general. However, the analysis also indicates that they would have searched even more if the Internet had not been present.",1
Environmental Influences and Decision-Making Uncertainty in Export Channels: Effects on Satisfaction and Performance,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Exporting is a popular entry strategy into foreign markets, but many firms that could export do not. One barrier to effective exporting may be uncertainty about the foreign environment. This article examines the perceptions of export executives regarding the foreign environment and decision-making uncertainty and their effects on satisfaction and economic performance in the export channel. A mail survey was received from 118 firms involved with exporting agricultural commodities. The results suggest that firms perceive environmental uncertainty and decision-making uncertainty to be greater in export channels than in domestic channels and that these types of uncertainty affect satisfaction and performance. Specifically, environmental dynamism and decision-making uncertainty negatively influenced satisfaction and performance in the export channel, while environmental complexity positively influenced performance. Managerial implications are discussed.",0
Understanding Value-Added Resellers? Assortments of Multicomponent Systems,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Interconnect standards increase choices. For example, in cardiac pacemakers, the IS-1 standard enables the ?pulse generator? from 6 manufacturers to be combined with the ?lead set? from the other 5 to create up to 30 additional mixed-brand pacemakers. However, observed assortment additions are much smaller, which is puzzling because manufacturers in extant models have welcomed such additions to reduce price competition and increase variety. Instead, conflict with the value-added resellers that create and carry these additions is commonplace. The authors extend the literature with an analytical model showing that value-added resellers limit the number and composition of additions to gain better upstream terms. This conflict is exacerbated when ?keystone? components are relatively more decisive in influencing customer choices, so their exclusion from an addition represents a larger loss. The empirical study of the multibillion-dollar auto paint refinish market finds assortment additions consistent with the authors? predictions. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of channel support programs in ameliorating these conflicts.",0
Multicomponent Systems Pricing: Rational Inattention and Downward Rigidities,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors examine the relative magnitude of price reductions for product systems and their constituent components (e.g., cameras, computers, monitors, lenses) and hypothesize that these price reductions systematically vary across different types of systems. The authors offer rational inattention as an explanation and document patterns of downward rigidity in online prices of computers and cameras that are consistent with this view. Their basic argument is that under certain circumstances, it is rational for consumers to ignore small price changes. This results in some price rigidity because firms would see no demand effect for small reductions. The authors suggest that this inattention systematically varies across different types of multicomponent systems, leading to specific hypotheses about sellers? pricing behavior. They first check the validity of their theoretical arguments using data from two surveys of consumers and managers. They then examine 669,557 daily price listings for 1052 high-end cameras and computers from 102 online vendors and find evidence consistent with their predictions. Using publicly available web traffic data, the authors also find that their predicted pricing behavior is aligned with better traffic response for the firm.",0
Cost Complexity of Pricing Decisions for Exporters in Developing and Emerging Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"As previously protected and emerging markets continue to open up for international trade, export firms often have a difficult time developing marketing strategies, particularly pricing strategies. However, few studies focus on the pricing practices of export firms, which makes it difficult to understand whether the same pricing strategies apply across markets, particularly in emerging markets. Using a framework of price complexity, the authors examine and compare the cost variables that are factored into price (price complexity) by export firms in the United States and Korea. The authors also investigate and compare some important noncost factors that influence pricing decisions for exporters in both their domestic and international markets. The results show that firms from the United States, a developed market, tend to factor more cost variables into price than do firms from an emerging market such as Korea. On the basis of the results of the study, the authors discuss implications for exporters and future research directions.",0
Marketing under Uncertainty: The Logic of an Effectual Approach,Journal of Marketing,2009,"How do people approach marketing in the face of uncertainty, when the product, the market, and the traditional details involved in market research are unknowable ex ante? The authors use protocol analysis to evaluate how 27 expert entrepreneurs approach such a problem compared with 37 managers with little entrepreneurial expertise (all 64 participants are asked to think aloud as they make marketing decisions in exactly the same unpredictable situation). The hypotheses are drawn from literature in cognitive science on (1) expertise in general and (2) entrepreneurial expertise in particular. The results show significant differences in heuristics used by the two groups. While those without entrepreneurial expertise rely primarily on predictive techniques, expert entrepreneurs tend to invert these. In particular, they use an effectual or nonpredictive logic to tackle uncertain market elements and to coconstruct novel markets with committed stakeholders.",0
Antismoking Messages for the International Teenage Segment: The Effectiveness of Message Valence and Intensity across Different Cultures,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"Based on an experiment among more than 2000 students in nine culturally diverse countries, this article investigates how the cultural characteristic of uncertainty avoidance moderates the impact of valence and intensity on the effectiveness of antismoking messages. The results show that adolescents with high uncertainty avoidance respond more favorably to loss-framed advertisements than to benefit-framed advertisements, whereas the opposite holds for those with low uncertainty avoidance.",0
Moral Identity and Judgments of Charitable Behaviors,Journal of Marketing,2007,"In several studies, the authors examine the potential to leverage a consumer's moral identity to enhance brand and company identification and promote goodwill through community relations. Studies 1a and 1b show that even when opportunity costs are equivalent (subjectively or economically), consumers who also have a highly self-important moral identity perceive the act of giving time versus money as more moral and self-expressive. The authors extend these findings to self-reported preferences and establish boundary conditions in two additional studies. Consumers with higher organizational status prefer to give money versus time, but this preference is weaker for those with a highly self-important moral identity (Study 2), and the preference for giving time versus money is more likely to emerge when the moral self is primed and the time given has a moral purpose (Study 3).",0
Consumer-Based Brand Equity and Firm Risk,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Investors and managers evaluate potential investments in terms of risk and return. Research has focused on linking marketing activities and resource deployments with returns but has largely neglected marketing's role in determining risk. Yet the theoretical literature asserts that investments in market-based assets, such as brands, should lead to reductions in firm risk. Adopting risk measures that are well established in the finance literature, the authors use credit ratings to capture debt-holder risk and the standard deviation of stock returns to measure equity-holder risk, which they then decompose into systematic and unsystematic equity risk. The authors examine the impact of consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) on firm risk using data covering 252 firms from EquiTrend, COMPUSTAT, and the Center for Research in Security Prices over the 2000?2006 period. They find that a firm's CBBE is associated with firm risk and explains variance in the risk measures beyond that explained by existing finance models (i.e., it has ?risk relevance?). They also find that CBBE has a stronger role in predicting firm-specific unsystematic risk than systematic risk but that it also has a particularly strong role in protecting equity holders from downside systematic risk. The results have clear economic significance and suggest that managers should make brand management part of the firm's risk management strategy and protect or even increase CBBE investments during periods of economic uncertainty.",0
Reexamining the Market Share?Customer Satisfaction Relationship,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Market share and customer satisfaction are often used to assess marketing performance. Despite the widespread assumption of a positive relationship between these two variables, the limited extant empirical literature on the subject indicates either a negative or a nonsignificant relationship. The authors reexamine this relationship over a longer time period than has previously been possible in a representative sample of U.S. consumer markets and find a consistently significant negative market share?customer satisfaction relationship. This is because customer satisfaction is generally not predictive of firms' future market share, but market share is a strong negative predictor of firms' future customer satisfaction. In follow-up analyses, the authors find that a firm's customer satisfaction can predict its future market share when it is benchmarked against that of its nearest rival and customer switching costs are low. In examining why the market share?future customer satisfaction relationship is generally negative, they find strong support for preference heterogeneity as a key mediator in this relationship. They also show that marketing more brands moderates the negative effect of preference heterogeneity on future customer satisfaction. Thus, larger brand portfolios offer a strategy solution for the general market share?satisfaction trade-off.",0
Featuring Mistakes: The Persuasive Impact of Purchase Mistakes in Online Reviews,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Companies often feature positive consumer reviews on their websites and in their promotional materials in an attempt to increase sales. However, little is known about which particular positive reviews companies should leverage to optimize sales. Across four lab studies involving both hypothetical and real choices as well as field data from a retailer?s website (Sephora), the authors find that consumers are more likely to purchase a product if it is recommended by a reviewer who has (vs. has not) made a prior purchase mistake. The authors define a purchase mistake as a self-identified suboptimal decision whereby people purchase a product that subsequently fails to meet a threshold level of expected performance. This persuasive advantage emerges because consumers perceive reviewers who admit a purchase mistake as having more expertise than even reviewers whose purchase experience has not been marred by mistakes. As a result, in marketers? attempts to increase the persuasive influence of reviews featured in their promotional materials, they may inadvertently decrease it by omitting the very information that would lead consumers to be more likely to purchase recommended products.",0
Executive Insights: Perspectives for International Marketers on the Japanese Market,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"?Marketing is a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products and value with others? (Kotler 1991). This definition is based on notions of: needs, wants, demands, products, utility, value, satisfaction, exchange, transactions, relationships, markets, marketing, and marketers. The need for marketers to focus on consumer behavior flows from this widely held definition.Yet, with this focus on consumers, little strategic note has been taken of the influence of key markets on other markets. For example, the United States?in particular, California?was a major influence on style and consumer tastes in the 1970s. The world witnessed the emergence of Silicon Valley and listened to Californian sounds, which were subsequently recycled through advertising and movies. The essential purpose of this article, therefore, is to highlight the importance of the Japanese market upon others and to offer a prognosis of the impact it will have.",0
Changes in Japan's Post-Bubble Business Environment: Implications for Foreign-Affiliated Companies,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"Long noted as highly competitive, the Japanese market has become even more cutthroat in the ?post-bubble? era, the period following the Japanese economic collapse. Only the fittest are likely to survive the correction taking place as Japan grapples with a severe recession that is threatening to extend worldwide. The research question pursued is how these ?moment-in-time? market changes affect foreign-affiliated companies in Japan. The study examines whether lessons that may be learned from those foreign companies that have successfully negotiated the minefield of Japan's business culture can be applied to other world markets. It then aims to induce, from their responses, some implications for international marketing strategy. It is based on a study of the post-bubble changes in the Japanese market from 1990 to 1998. Using a Grounded Theory approach, the research process involves 58 personal interviews with executives of 52 successful foreign firms operating in Japan. A framework distilled from a previous article by the author is used to compare and contrast the pre- and post-bubble situations.",0
The Customer Relationship Management Process: Its Measurement and Impact on Performance,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"An understanding of how to manage relationships with customers effectively has become an important topic for both academicians and practitioners in recent years. However, the existing academic literature and the practical applications of customer relationship management (CRM) strategies do not provide a clear indication of what specifically constitutes CRM processes. In this study, the authors (1) conceptualize a construct of the CRM process and its dimensions, (2) operationalize and validate the construct, and (3) empirically investigate the organizational performance consequences of implementing CRM processes. Their research questions are addressed in two cross-sectional studies across four different industries and three countries. The first key outcome is a theoretically sound CRM process measure that outlines three key stages: initiation, maintenance, and termination. The second key result is that the implementation of CRM processes has a moderately positive association with both perceptual and objective company performance.",1
Balancing Acquisition and Retention Resources to Maximize Customer Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2005,"In this research, the authors present a modeling framework for balancing resources between customer acquisition efforts and customer retention efforts. The key question that the framework addresses is, ?What is the customer profitability maximizing balance?? In addition, they answer questions about how much marketing spending to allocate to customer acquisition and retention and how to distribute those allocations across communication channels.",0
Crafting a JMR Manuscript,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The author provides a guide for effectively communicating and organizing ideas in an academic marketing paper in a manner that allows reviewers to best see their merit. He argues that it is often not the central idea of a piece that falters, but rather the mechanical and stylistic expression of that idea. He posits a straightforward methodology for eschewing ambiguity and appropriately highlighting salient research against a backdrop that is clean and well constructed.",1
On the Profitability of Long-Life Customers in a Noncontractual Setting: An Empirical Investigation and Implications for Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Relationship marketing emphasizes the need for maintaining long-term customer relationships. It is beneficial, in general, to serve customers over a longer time, especially in a contractual relationship. However, it is not clear whether some of the findings observed in a contractual setting hold good in noncontractual scenarios: relationships between a seller and a buyer that are not governed by a contract or membership. The authors offer four different propositions in this study and subsequently test each one in a noncontractual context. The four propositions relate to whether (1) there exists a strong positive customer lifetime?profitability relationship, (2) profits increase over time, (3) the costs of serving long-life customers are less, and (4) long-life customers pay higher prices. The authors develop arguments both for and against each of the propositions. The data for this study, obtained from a large catalog retailer, cover a three-year window and are recorded on a daily basis. The empirical findings observed in this study challenge all the expectations derived from the literature. Long-life customers are not necessarily profitable customers. The authors develop plausible explanations for findings that go against the available evidence in the literature and identify three indicators through discriminant analysis that can help managers focus their efforts on more profitable customers. The authors draw several marketing implications and acknowledge the limitations of the study.",0
The Impact of Customer Relationship Characteristics on Profitable Lifetime Duration,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors develop a framework that incorporates projected profitability of customers in the computation of lifetime duration. Furthermore, the authors identify factors under a manager's control that explain the variation in the profitable lifetime duration. They also compare other frameworks with the traditional methods such as the recency, frequency, and monetary value framework and past customer value and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Finally, the authors develop several key implications that can be of value to decision makers in managing customer relationships.",0
Fatal (Fiscal) Attraction: Spendthrifts and Tightwads in Marriage,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Although much research has found that ?birds of a feather flock together,? the authors suggest that opposites tend to attract when it comes to certain spending tendencies; that is, tightwads, who generally spend less than they would ideally like to spend, and spendthrifts, who generally spend more than they would ideally like to spend, tend to marry each other, consistent with the notion that people are attracted to mates who possess characteristics dissimilar to those they deplore in themselves. Despite this complementary attraction, tightwad?spendthrift differences within a marriage predict conflict over finances, which in turn predicts diminished marital well-being. These relationships persist when controlling for important financial outcomes (household-level savings and credit card debt). These findings underscore the importance of studying the relationships among money, consumption, and happiness at an interpersonal level.",1
Executive Insights: Knowledge?The Source of Sustainable Competitive Advantage,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Today's fast-paced business environment is characterized by chaotic markets with constantly evolving global customers, competitors, and suppliers. Product life cycles are becoming ever shorter, demanding more rapid and complex product development processes that are uniquely tuned into ever-changing customer demands. Global customers demand consistency in service and quality at globally competitive prices.Tomorrow's winners will be determined by those few firms that create the ability to develop constant and continuous innovation and transformation. This ability will be successfully manifested by those enterprises that understand, properly harness, and exploit global learning and the use of the organization's intellectual capital.",0
Penny for Your Preferences: Leveraging Self-Expression to Encourage Small Prosocial Gifts,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Prior approaches that leverage identity to motivate prosocial behavior are often limited to the set of people who already strongly identify with an organization (e.g., prior donors) or by the costs and challenges associated with developing stronger organization-linked identities among a broader audience (e.g., encouraging more people to care). In contrast, this research demonstrates that small prosocial gifts, such as tips or small donations, can be encouraged by framing the act of giving as an opportunity to express identity-relevant preferences?even if such preferences are not explicitly related to prosociality or the organization in need. Rather than simply asking people to give, the ?dueling preferences? approach investigated in this research frames the act of giving as a choice between two options (e.g., cats vs. dogs, chocolate vs. vanilla ice cream). Dueling preferences increases prosocial giving by providing potential givers with a greater opportunity for self-expression?an intrinsically desirable opportunity. Seven experiments conducted in the laboratory, online, and in the field support this theorized process while casting doubt on relevant alternatives. This research contributes to work on self-expression and identity and sheds light on how organizations can encourage prosocial behavior.",0
Does Advertising Spending Influence Media Coverage of the Advertiser?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002?2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States. These findings raise concerns about the independence of editorial content and coverage of magazines.",0
"Cross-Sectional versus Longitudinal Survey Research: Concepts, Findings, and Guidelines",Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Marketing academics and practitioners frequently employ cross-sectional surveys. In recent years, editors, reviewers, and authors have expressed increasing concern about the validity of this approach. These validity concerns center on reducing common method variance bias and enhancing causal inferences. Longitudinal data collection is commonly offered as a solution to these problems. In this article, the authors conceptually examine the role of longitudinal surveys in addressing these validity concerns. Then, they provide an illustrative comparison of the validity of cross-sectional versus longitudinal surveys using two data sets and a Monte Carlo simulation. The conceptualization and findings suggest that under certain conditions, the results from cross-sectional data exhibit validity comparable to the results obtained from longitudinal data. This article concludes by offering a set of guidelines to assist researchers in deciding whether to employ a longitudinal survey approach.",1
The Acquisition and Utilization of Information in New Product Alliances: A Strength-of-Ties Perspective,Journal of Marketing,2001,"In this article, the authors examine the acquisition and utilization of information in new product alliances. Drawing from research in social network theory with a focus on the strength-of-ties literature, the authors suggest that horizontal alliances have lower levels of relational embeddedness and higher levels of knowledge redundancy than vertical alliances. The authors then suggest that though embeddedness enhances both the acquisition and utilization of information in alliances, redundancy diminishes information acquisition but enhances information utilization. The authors test these ideas using a sample of 106 U.S. firms that recently have participated in new product alliances. Although the results are broadly supportive of the predictions, they are also surprising because they question key underlying assumptions of the strength-of-ties literature. For example, closely tied individual actors are typically assumed to share both high levels of embeddedness and high levels of redundancy, but the present research finds that this assumption does not hold for organizational actors. The authors discuss the implications of these findings specifically for new product alliances and for research on tie strength among organizations in general.",0
Interfirm Cooperation and Customer Orientation,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"This article examines the implications of interfirm cooperation for a firm's level of customer orientation. Drawing on research in marketing, organizational theory, and economics, the authors suggest that firms engaged in cooperative alliances with competitors will become less customer oriented over time. Using longitudinal survey data, the authors find that firms in alliances dominated by competitors experience a significant decrease in their level of customer orientation. In contrast, the authors do not observe this type of decrease for firms in alliances dominated by channel members. Moreover, the authors find that both behavioral and structural mechanisms influence the relationship between alliance type and customer orientation. Behaviorally, firms in competitor-dominated alliances with weak relational ties with their collaborators exhibit a greater decrease in customer orientation compared with firms with strong ties with their collaborators. Structurally, firms that collaborate with competitors in alliances with a third-party monitor, such as a government agency, experience a smaller decrease in customer orientation than firms in alliances without such a monitor.",1
A Cultural Models Approach to Service Recovery,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Service recovery research remains conflicted in its understanding of consumers' recovery expectations and of why similar goods or service failures may lead to different recovery expectations. The authors argue that this conflict results from the assumption that consumer recovery expectations are monolithic and largely homogeneous, driven mainly by behavioral, relational, or contextual stimuli. Instead, recovery scenarios involving high-involvement (i.e., self-relevant) goods and service failures may activate closely held, identity-related cultural models that, though ultimately applied to regain balance (a foundational schema), differ according to their sociocultural heritage and create a range of unique consumer recovery preferences. The authors empirically identify three embodied cultural models?relational, oppositional, and utilitarian?that consumers apply to goods or service failures. Furthermore, the authors discuss implications for service recovery research and services marketing practice and introduce adaptive service recovery diagnostics that enable providers to identify and respond to consumers' varying recovery preferences.",0
Dynamic Effects of Social Influence and Direct Marketing on the Adoption of High-Technology Products,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Many firms capitalize on their customers? social networks to improve the success rate of their new products. In this article, the authors analyze the dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing on the adoption of a new high-technology product. Social influence is likely to play a role because the decision to adopt a high-involvement product requires extensive information gathering from various sources. The authors use call detail records to construct ego networks for a large sample of customers of a Dutch mobile telecommunications operator. Using a fractional polynomial hazard approach to model adoption timing and multiple social influence variables, they provide a fine-grained analysis of social influence. They show that the effect of social influence from cumulative adoptions in a customer's network decreases from the product introduction onward, whereas the influence of recent adoptions remains constant. The effect of direct marketing is also positive and decreases from the product introduction onward. This study provides new insights into the adoption of high-technology products by analyzing dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing simultaneously.",0
Choice of Cause in Cause-Related Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Spurred by the consumer demand for companies to be socially responsible, cause-related marketing (CM), in which fund raising for a cause is tied to purchase of a firm's products, has become popular in recent years. The authors demonstrate the conditions in which CM campaigns that allow consumers to choose the cause that receives the donation lead to greater consumer support than those in which the company determines the cause. They show that choice in this context is helpful as long as it increases consumers? perception of personal role in helping the cause. Specifically, allowing consumers to select the cause in a CM campaign is more likely to enhance perceived personal role and, thus, purchase intentions (1) for those consumers who are high (vs. low) in collectivism and (2) when the company and causes have low (vs. high) perceptual fit. Finally, the authors show that under certain conditions, choice may have a negative impact on perceived personal role and consumer support of CM campaigns.",0
Is the First to Market the First to Fail? Empirical Evidence for Industrial Goods Businesses,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"When entering a new market, the first entrant typically faces the greatest market and technological uncertainties. Memorable phrases reflect the associated survival risk, such as ?the first to market is the first to fail? and ?the pioneer is the one with the arrows in its back.? Although research estimates the market pioneer's survival rate, the typical pioneer survival rate has not been compared with that of early followers. The authors' study compares survival rates for 167 first-entrant market pioneers versus 267 early followers. For these industrial goods businesses, 66% of the pioneers versus 48% of the early followers survived at least ten years. The main conclusion is that the pioneer's temporary monopoly over the early followers plus its first-mover advantages typically offset the survival risks associated with market and technological uncertainties. These results are consistent with previous research in the sense that first-mover advantages that increase a pioneer's market share also help protect the pioneer from outright failure.",1
Resource Deployment Stability and Performance in International Research-and-Development Alliances: A Self-Determination Theory Explanation,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"This study theorizes that resource deployment stability is an influential characteristic in international research-and-development (R&D) alliances. The authors develop and test a model of antecedents and performance outcomes of this form of parental persistence. The model is novel in its use of self-determination theory to investigate self-motivational forces that drive a venturing firm's social integration through resource deployment. The results reveal that resource deployment stability is positively linked to performance satisfaction and schedule adherence. Conflict management is positively linked to resource deployment stability, while behavioral control exerts a positive influence on performance satisfaction, though it is not related to resource deployment stability. Cultural similarity is positively linked to resource deployment stability in older (vs. younger) alliances. However, it is negatively related to schedule adherence in older (vs. younger) alliances. The authors discuss the implications of these results for both theory development and international R&D alliance management.",0
The Enhancing Versus Backfiring Effects of Positive Emotion in Consumer Reviews,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Researchers, marketers, and consumers often believe that amplifying emotional content is impactful for the spread of information and purchasing decisions. However, there is little systematic investigation of when emotionality backfires. This research demonstrates when and why positive emotion can have enhancing versus backfiring effects. The authors find that reviewers who express greater positive emotion are indeed more positive toward their products, regardless of product type. In addition, expressed emotion for hedonic products has a positive impact when read by others, but this emotion backfires for utilitarian products, leading others to be less positive. The authors construct a conceptual model of these effects and show that violated expectations leading to decreased trust underlie this divergence between reviewers and readers. The effects occur in well-controlled experiments as well as computational linguistic analysis of 100,000 Amazon reviews across 500 products. Indeed, emotional reviews of utilitarian products are less likely to become popular and be displayed on the product?s front page on Amazon. This work also introduces a novel tool for quantifying natural language in marketing: the Evaluative Lexicon.",1
Relationship Bonding and Trust as a Foundation for Commitment in U.S.?Mexican Strategic Alliances: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2002,This article develops a model to understand the influence of relationship bonding on trust and commitment between partners in international strategic alliances. Theoretical foundations are drawn from resource dependency and social exchange theories as frameworks for the analysis of interdependency. The model is tested in the context of U.S.?Mexican strategic alliances. The results of this study show that trust and commitment assist in building interdependency between both partners and perceived structural dependency is a prerequisite to maintain and develop social dynamics in the relationship. Trust is built mainly on economic and strategic cooperation for U.S. managers whereas Mexican managers perceive social and affective dimensions as its driving forces. Both U.S. and Mexican managers perceive commitment to the relationship as supported on high levels of trust. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the management of the relationship and building interdependency from a cultural perspective.,0
Designing Loyalty-Building Programs for Packaged Goods Brands,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The authors investigate the effects of loyalty programs on loyalty to packaged goods brands. Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations.",1
"When Will a Brand Scandal Spill Over, and how Should Competitors Respond?",Journal of Marketing Research,2006,Three experiments identify conditions under which a brand scandal spills over and negatively affects attitudes and beliefs about the product category and about competing brands. The research also examines factors that may enhance or reduce the likelihood of spillover effects and strategies for responding to scandal spillover.,1
Customer Strategy: Observations from the Trenches,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This short article traces the evolution of customer relationship management from the perspective of an author who has written, researched, and worked in the field since the beginning of the relationship revolution in the early 1990s. Additional topics for research are suggested, especially in the area of understanding how companies can increase enterprise value by managing the rate of increase in customer equity.",0
The Impact of Dynamic Presentation Format on Consumer Preferences for Hedonic Products and Services,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Manufacturers and online retailers are readily availing themselves of new technologies to present their merchandise using a variety of formats, including static (still image) and dynamic (video) portrayal. Building on vividness theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that presenting products and services using a dynamic visual format enhances consumer preference for hedonic options and willingness to pay for those options. The dynamic presentation format increases involvement with the product/service experience in a manner presumably similar to that of the actual product experience. The result is an increased preference for and valuation of hedonic options. This holds true for experiential and search products in single and joint evaluations and carries over to subsequent choices. Across all studies, the results demonstrate that a dynamic (relative to static) presentation format enhances choice of the hedonically superior (vs. utilitarian-superior) option by more than 79%.",0
Integration of Discrepant Sales Forecasts: The Influence of Plausibility Inferences Based on an Evoked Range,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors hypothesize that when managers integrate two projections to form a sales estimate, they evoke and use a sales range to judge inappropriately the plausibility of each projection. This judged plausibility, as well as the ?margin of error? (based on the market research company's typical accuracy), is used to assign weights to each projection. Five experiments find strong evidence for this process and demonstrate a resulting bias.",1
Specific Investments in Marketing Relationships: Expropriation and Bonding Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Specific investments, which are tailored to a particular company or value-chain partner, are important components of firms' marketing strategies. At the same time, extant theory suggests that such investments pose considerable risk, because they put the receiver in a position to opportunistically exploit the investor. In this article, the authors examine this ?expropriation? scenario but also consider whether specific investments, because of their specialized nature, may actually ?bond? the receiver and reduce opportunism under certain conditions. These conditions involve a focal relationship's time horizon (i.e., its extendedness) and particular norms. The key theoretical argument is that the effect of specific investments on opportunism will shift in a nonmonotonic fashion over the range of these relationship conditions. The authors test their research hypotheses empirically through parallel analyses on each side of 198 matched buyer?supplier dyads. The empirical tests provide general support for the predictions but also reveal differences between buyers and suppliers regarding the focal effects. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for marketing theory and practice.",1
Mapping Time: How the Spatial Representation of Time Influences Intertemporal Choices,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Cognitive linguistic studies have found that people perceive time to be intertwined with space. Western consumers, in particular, visualize time on a horizontal spatial axis, with past events on the left and future events on the right. Underexplored, however, is whether and how space-time associations influence future time-related judgments and decisions. For instance, can spatial location cues affect intertemporal decisions? Integrating cognitive linguistics, time psychology, and intertemporal choice, the authors demonstrate across five studies that when choices are displayed horizontally (vs. vertically), consumers more steeply discount future outcomes. Furthermore, this effect is serially mediated by attention to time and anticipated duration estimates. Specifically, the authors propose and demonstrate that horizontal (vs. vertical) temporal displays enhance the amount of attention devoted to considering the time delay and lead consumers to overestimate how long it will take to receive benefits. This research has important implications for consumers who want to forgo immediate gratification and for firms that need to manage consumers? time perceptions.",1
Incorporating Consumer Product Categorizations into Shelf Layout Design,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Using one field and two online lab experiments, this article shows that congruency between shelf layout and a consumer?s internal product categorization increases the perceived variety of the assortment and reduces the perceived complexity of the shelf layout. These assortment perceptions, in turn, heighten purchase intention and satisfaction toward the chosen item. Results are robust across internal categorization measurements (planogram design vs. sorting tasks), congruency measures (distance- vs. matching-based), and products (biscuits vs. yogurt snacks). In the field study, familiarity?operationalized as either consumption frequency or subjective product knowledge?increased the overall effect of categorization congruency and strengthened its pathway through perceived variety (vs. the one through complexity). The authors show how their research can be exploited to improve shelf layouts by optimizing the external categorization. They demonstrate the value of a unifying Bayesian framework for research on behavioral decision making that uses the same set of posterior parameter draws for parameter inference, moderated mediation analysis, and optimization under uncertainty.",1
Incorporating Context Effects into a Choice Model,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines.",1
The Effect of Links and Excerpts on Internet News Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Internet news and search sites often excerpt content from and link to competing news outlets. On the one hand, providing outbound links can make the linking site more attractive, even to the point of stealing traffic from the linked sites. Regulatory policy, such as the European Union?s Copyright Directive Article 15 taxing links, is predicated in part on this idea. On the other hand, receiving inbound links can increase a linked site?s audience by informing readers about its news content that day. To explore these opposing perspectives, the authors develop a dynamic learning model and fit it to browsing and link data from celebrity news sites. They then simulate how banning links affects consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least. On average, linking benefits both the linking and linked sites. The authors estimate that exposure to a link increases the likelihood of visiting the linked site by .14%. This increase is approximately three times the commonly reported click-through rate for paid display advertisements.",1
Pleasant Ambient Scents: A Meta-Analysis of Customer Responses and Situational Contingencies,Journal of Marketing,2019,"To prevail in the fierce competition of in-store experiences, some firms have focused on providing pleasant ambient scents. However, equivocal results on scent effects make generalizations and managerial guidance uncertain. While efforts to consolidate research findings have been conducted, a comprehensive quantitative integration is notably lacking. In this meta-analysis, the authors integrate 671 available effects from ambient scent experiments and show that exposure to pleasant ambient scents on average produces a substantial increase in the level of customer responses (3%?15%). The effects of ambient scent depend on situational contingencies and are, for example, positively related to congruency, unidimensional aroma structure, ascribed familiarity of a scent, service exchange, proportion of female participants in the sample, and imagined (vs. fictitious) offering. Thus, the authors estimate expenditures would increase by 3% and 23% for an average and a most favorable condition, respectively. The authors also examine effect patterns, identifying, for example, ambient scent as more cognitive than affective and nonlinear effects of perceived concentration. Using the insights, they develop a research agenda and provide clear strategic guidance to leverage ambient scent effects.",0
A Meta-Analysis of When and How Advertising Creativity Works,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Although creativity is often considered a key success factor in advertising, the marketing literature lacks a systematic empirical account of when and how advertising creativity works. The authors use a meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on advertising creativity and test different theoretical explanations for its effects. The analysis covers 93 data sets taken from 67 papers that provide 878 effect sizes. The results show robust positive effects but also highlight the importance of considering both originality and appropriateness when investing in advertising creativity. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are stronger for high- (vs. low-) involvement products, and that the effects on ad (but not brand) reactions are marginally stronger for unfamiliar brands. An empirical test of theoretical mechanisms shows that affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly explain these effects, and that originality mainly leads to affect transfer, whereas appropriateness leads to signaling. The authors also call for further research connecting advertising creativity with sales and studying its effects in digital contexts.",0
Compound Relationships between Firms,Journal of Marketing,2007,"In this article, the authors introduce the idea of a compound relationship; that is, for many pairs of firms, the overall relationship between the two firms is composed of multiple simple relationships: supplier to customer, and vice versa; competitor to competitor; and partners. This multiplicity of relationships can lead to both opportunities and challenges for each of the two firms in the dyad. The authors define the nature of compound relationships and delineate why it is important for the firm to treat them as such rather than focusing only on the simple relationships. They distinguish compound relationships from social networks and simple dyadic relationships and relate the construct to exchange theory, ?coopetition,? and the interorganizational relationship literature in marketing. They then use the political economy framework to develop a set of conceptual propositions that apply to many aspects of compound relationships. They end with some speculations regarding the appropriate management of compound relationships and propose opportunities for further research.",0
Price Transparency and Retail Prices: Evidence from Fuel Price Signs in the Italian Highway System,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Price transparency initiatives are typically undertaken by third parties to ensure that consumers can compare the prices of competing offers in markets in which obtaining such information is costly. Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations? margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented. Analysis of customer transaction data confirms this finding, showing that less than 10% of consumers use the posted price information effectively.",1
Subsidiary use of Foreign Marketing Knowledge,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"A source of potentially valuable knowledge in multinational enterprises is foreign marketing knowledge?that is, knowledge from one country unit that may offer value and competitive advantage to marketing managers in other country units. This article builds on marketing and management knowledge transfer research to further understand both the conditions under which one subsidiary uses external knowledge from another subsidiary and the outcomes of such use in the subsidiary's market. Using the theory of value creation and appropriation and field interviews with headquarter and subsidiary marketing managers, the authors develop a model and research propositions of the enabling, motivating, and perceiving conditions that affect foreign marketing knowledge use and subsequent effects on marketing program effectiveness and efficiency, organization identification, and intellectual capital in subsidiaries of multinational enterprises.",0
Determinants of Pay Levels and Structures in Sales Organizations,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Two key issues in business-to-business (B2B) sales force management are (1) how much a given sales job should be compensated (pay level) and (2) how much of the compensation should be fixed versus variable (pay structure). The authors examine the paychecks drawn by people in more than 14,000 selling jobs and more than 4000 sales management jobs in five B2B industry sectors in five European countries. They show that pay levels and structures reflect an apparent balancing of two conflicting pressures: the economic imperative (to reward better performers by heightening pay dispersion) and the compensation differential compression resulting from high tax regimes. In particular, B2B firms appear to use variable pay as a way to lessen the salary differential compression impact of high tax regimes on salesperson motivation. Furthermore, similar to chief executive officers, sales managers can have an important multiplier effect that justifies paying them at increasing rates as job challenge rises.",0
The Teasing Effect: An Underappreciated Benefit of Creating and Resolving an Uncertainty,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Seven studies covering diverse contexts show an underappreciated benefit of teasing in information acquisition: first creating and then resolving an uncertainty can generate a net positive experience, yet laypeople do not seek out this process. For example, trivia readers report better hedonic experiences if they are first teased with some missing information and then given that information than if they receive all the information at the same time; however, when given a choice, readers prefer to receive all information at the same time. The authors further show that teasing is hedonically beneficial because uncertainty engenders curiosity and thereby builds a potential for a positive experience, whereas uncertainty resolution satisfies the curiosity and thereby realizes that potential. This research yields practical implications by demonstrating that imbuing an ad with an uncertainty creation?resolution process improves the viewer's attitude toward and increases the viewer's willingness to try the advertised product.",1
Firm Innovativeness and Its Performance Outcomes: A Meta-Analytic Review and Theoretical Integration,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Drawing on the chain-of-effects model as a unifying framework, this meta-analysis indicates that firm innovativeness indirectly affects firm value through its effects on market position and financial position. In addition, the findings suggest that innovativeness has direct positive effects on financial position and firm value. Moreover, the meta-analysis provides evidence of reverse causality in the innovativeness?firm value relationship. Importantly, the results also reveal that the positive effects of firm innovativeness on market position and financial position are stronger for larger firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in high-tech industries, for innovativeness outputs and for radical innovations. Finally, the meta-analytic evidence also indicates that the relationship between innovativeness and firm value is stronger for smaller firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in low-tech industries, for innovativeness inputs, for innovativeness culture, and for radical innovations.",0
Inspired to Create: Awe Enhances Openness to Learning and the Desire for Experiential Creation,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Automated fabrication, home services, and premade goods pervade the modern consumer landscape. Against this backdrop, this research explores how the emotion of awe might motivate a consumer to partake instead in experiential creation (i.e., activities in which they actively produce an outcome) by enhancing their willingness to learn. Across eight experiments, experiencing awe (vs. happiness, excitement, pride, amusement, or neutrality) increases people?s likelihood of choosing an experiential creation gift (vs. one not involving experiential creation), willingness to pay for experiential creation products (vs. comparable ready-made products), likelihood of creating a bespoke snack (vs. taking a premade one), preference for experiential creation solutions (vs. solutions without experiential creation), likelihood of purchasing a product when it is framed as high (vs. low) in experiential creation, preference for high (vs. low) experiential creation meals, and likelihood of creating a knickknack (vs. taking a premade one). This greater desire for experiential creation is mediated by openness to learning and moderated by the need for closure. These findings, relevant for firms encouraging creation-oriented products and behaviors, offer fresh insights for engaging consumers.",1
Measuring Marketing Productivity: Current Knowledge and Future Directions,Journal of Marketing,2004,"For too long, marketers have not been held accountable for showing how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. As time has gone by, this lack of accountability has undermined marketers? credibility, threatened the standing of the marketing function within the firm, and even threatened marketing's existence as a distinct capability within the firm. This article proposes a broad framework for assessing marketing productivity, cataloging what is already known, and suggesting areas for further research. The authors conclude that it is possible to show how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. The effective dissemination of new methods of assessing marketing productivity to the business community will be a major step toward raising marketing's vitality in the firm and, more important, toward raising the performance of the firm itself. The authors also suggest many areas in which further research is essential to making methods of evaluating marketing productivity increasingly valid, reliable, and practical.",0
Optimizing Service Productivity,Journal of Marketing,2012,"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor?automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.",0
Return on Marketing: Using Customer Equity to Focus Marketing Strategy,Journal of Marketing,2004,"The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers? lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers? performance with that of competitors? drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.",0
"Getting Return on Quality: Revenue Expansion, Cost Reduction, or Both?",Journal of Marketing,2002,"Financial benefits from quality may be derived from revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both simultaneously. The literature on both market orientation and customer satisfaction provides considerable support for the effectiveness of the revenue expansion perspective, whereas the literature on both quality and operations provides equally impressive support for the effectiveness of the cost reduction perspective. There is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of attempting both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously, and some of what little empirical and theoretical literature is available suggests that emphasizing both simultaneously may not work. In a study of managers in firms seeking to obtain a financial return from quality improvements, the authors address the issue of which quality profitability emphasis (revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both) is most effective. The authors examine firm performance using managers' reports of firm performance and longitudinal secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. Although it is clear that no company can neglect either revenue expansion or cost reduction, the empirical results suggest that firms that adopt primarily a revenue expansion emphasis perform better than firms that try to emphasize cost reduction and better than firms that try to emphasize both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously. The results have implications with respect to how both theory and practice view organizational efforts to achieve financial returns from quality improvements.",0
From Generic to Branded: A Model of Spillover in Paid Search Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"In Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are generic (e.g., ?hotels?) or branded (e.g., ?Hilton Hotels?). Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove?Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric. The findings have implications for understanding search behavior on the Internet and the management of paid search advertising.",1
A Latent Instrumental Variables Approach to Modeling Keyword Conversion in Paid Search Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors present a modeling approach to assess the purchase conversion performance of individual keywords in paid search advertising. The model facilitates estimation of daily keyword conversion and click-through rates in a sparse data environment while accounting for the endogenous position of the text advertisement served in response to a search. Position endogeneity in paid search data can arise from both omitted variables and measurement error. The authors propose a latent instrumental variable approach to address this problem. They estimate their model on keyword-level paid search data containing daily information on impressions, clicks, and reservations for a major lodging chain. They find that higher positions increase both the click-through and conversion rates. When advertisements are served in higher positions, approximately one-third of new conversions is due to increased click-through while approximately two-thirds are due to increased conversion rates. The authors show that the keyword list generated on the basis of their estimated conversion rates outperforms the status quo list as well as lists generated by observed conversion and click-through rates.",1
A New Method to Aid Copy Testing of Paid Search Text Advertisements,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"The authors propose a new approach to evaluate the perceptions and performance of a large set of paid search ads. This approach consists of two parts. First, primary data on hundreds of ads are collected through paired comparisons of their relative ability to generate awareness, interest, desire, action, and click performance. The authors use the Elo algorithm, a statistical model calibrated on paired comparisons, to score the full set of ads on relative perceptions and click performance. The estimated scores validate the theoretical link between perceptions and performance. Second, the authors predict the perceptions and performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual content metrics. The predictive model allows for direct effects and interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a ?large p, small n? problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of equations. The authors demonstrate that this approach ably forecasts relative ad performance by leveraging perceptions inferred from content alone.",1
Designed to S(m)ell: When Scented Advertising Induces Proximity and Enhances Appeal,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Prior research on the use of scent in advertising has shown that scent can enhance the memorability of and engagement with an ad. However, can scenting an ad also change the way consumers perceive and react to the advertised product? This research provides new insights for this question and demonstrates an additional facet of scent: its ability to physically represent the essence of a target product and thus induce a sense of proximity. Through six studies, the authors show that scented ads enhance consumers? sense of proximity of the advertised product and consequently increase product appeal. In line with the proposed visceral nature of the effect, this effect holds even for unpleasant scents but is contingent on the scent?s ability to represent the advertised product. The effect is weakened when the product is physically close. The findings of this research have implications for when and why firms should use scented ads.",1
Making Customer Relationship Management Work: The Measurement and Profitable Management of Customer Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Customer relationship management (CRM) is perceived to be failing, and there is an urgent need for some practical ways to address this issue. The research presented in this article demonstrates that the implementation of CRM activities delivers greater profits. Using calculations of the lifetime value of customers in two longitudinal case studies, the research finds that customer management strategies change as more is discovered about the value of the customer. These changes lead to better firm performance. The contribution of this article is to show that CRM works and that a relatively straightforward analysis of the value of the customer can make a real difference.",0
Structural and Behavioral Predictors of Export Adoption: A Norwegian Study,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"A model is developed for predicting export adoption. The export adoption decision is viewed as a logical continuation of antecedent structural characteristics and behavior. Predictors and measurement problems are discussed. To illustrate the model, antecedent firm size, domestic market coverage, number of new products developed, and recent domestic market expansion are used to predict export adoption on a sample of previously non-exporting firms. The findings provide some support for the model.",0
Do Spoilers Really Spoil? Using Topic Modeling to Measure the Effect of Spoiler Reviews on Box Office Revenue,Journal of Marketing,2020,"A sizable portion of online movie reviews contain spoilers, defined as information that prematurely resolves plot uncertainty. In this research, the authors study the consequences of spoiler reviews using data on box office revenue and online word of mouth for movies released in the United States. To capture the degree of information in spoiler review text that reduces plot uncertainty, the authors propose a spoiler intensity metric and measure it using a correlated topic model. Using a dynamic panel model with movie fixed effects and instrumental variables, the authors find a significant and positive relationship between spoiler intensity and box office revenue with an elasticity of .06. The positive effect of spoiler intensity is greater for movies with a limited release, smaller advertising spending, and moderate user ratings, and is stronger in the earlier days after the movie?s release. Using an event study and online experiments, the authors provide further evidence that spoiler reviews can help consumers reduce their uncertainty about the quality of movies, consequently encouraging theater visits. Thus, movie studios may benefit from consumers? access to plot-intense reviews and should actively monitor the content of spoiler reviews to better forecast box office performance.",0
A Penny for Your Thoughts: Referral Reward Programs and Referral Likelihood,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Because referral reward programs reward existing customers and build the customer base, firms use them to encourage customers to make recommendations to others. The authors report on four experiments in which they find that rewards increase referral likelihood. More specifically, they find that rewards are particularly effective in increasing referral to weak ties and for weaker brands. It is also important who receives the reward. Overall, for weak ties and weaker brands, giving a reward to the provider of the recommendation is important. For strong ties and stronger brands, providing at least some of the reward to the receiver of the referral seems to be more effective. The authors discuss the implications of the results for the design of reward programs.",0
On the Method of Evolutionary Psychology and Its Applicability to Consumer Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"There is a growing interest among marketing scholars to examine the evolutionary bases of a wide range of consumer phenomena. While specific evolutionary hypotheses are typically tested using tools familiar to marketing researchers (e.g., experiments, surveys), the method of evolutionary psychology is rooted in its unique epistemology (the manner in which knowledge is generated and organized), which comprises three elements: (1) the distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations, (2) the building of nomolological networks of cumulative evidence (triangulation of convergent lines of evidence), and (3) an organizing tree of knowledge. The purpose of this article is to describe this process using marketing-relevant examples as a means of providing a framework of best practices to marketing scholars aiming to incorporate the evolutionary lens within their research programs.",1
The Sales Lead Black Hole: On Sales Reps' Follow-Up of Marketing Leads,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The sales lead black hole?the 70% of leads generated by marketing departments that sales representatives do not pursue?may result from competing demands on sales reps' time. Using the motivation?opportunity?ability framework, the authors consider factors that influence sales reps' pursuit (or lack thereof) of marketing and self-generated leads. The proportion of time that sales reps devote to marketing leads depends on organizational lead prequalification and managerial tracking processes (extrinsic motivation), as well as marketing lead volume (opportunity), and sales rep experience and performance (ability). Consistent with a person?situation framework, individual sales rep factors should also moderate the influence of organizational processes on lead follow-up. Data from 461 sales reps employed by four firms confirm that as sales reps' experience increases, their responses to managerial tracking of lead follow-up and marketing lead volume decrease; responses to the quality of the lead prequalification process increase. As sales reps' performance improves, their response to the volume of marketing leads increases, but their response to managerial tracking decreases. The interplay of individual sales reps' abilities and organizational marketing and sales processes explains differences in sales reps' follow-up of marketing leads.?",0
Assessing the Impact of Customer Concentration on Initial Public Offering and Balance Sheet?Based Outcomes,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Using the notion of customer concentration, the authors argue that firms should evenly spread their revenues across their customers, rather than focusing on a few major customer relationships. Prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources, thereby producing positive performance outcomes. However, building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory, the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm's bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value, which, in turn, hurts profits. Using a sample of 1,023 initial public offerings (IPOs) and robust econometric methods, they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts IPO outcomes, but significantly hurts balance sheet?based outcomes (e.g., profitability). The results suggest that a 10% increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35% (or about $7 million) in the subsequent year, or 9.4% cumulatively over the next four years (or about $20.32 million). Further, the authors find that the negative effects of customer concentration decrease with increase in organizational (marketing, technological, and operational) capabilities and increase with low customer credit quality.",0
Influencing Acquisition Performance in High-Technology Industries: The Role of Innovation and Relational Overlap,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Acquisition is an important activity that enables firms to adapt their resource configurations. Acquisition literature has focused only on the levels of innovation or relational resources, the primary dimensions of organizational resource bases. The authors argue that in addition to the levels, the degree of overlap between the acquiring and target firms, in terms of innovation and relational resources, should influence acquisitions. Furthermore, they argue for the importance of the quality of the target's resources along with factors influencing the acquirer's absorptive capacity (e.g., the chief executive officer's [CEO's] functional background and the acquiring firm's marketing intensity and acquisition experience) as contingencies. Using 319 biopharmaceutical acquisitions and a random-effect regression model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of relational and innovation overlap, the authors find that innovation overlap has a positive effect, whereas relational overlap has a negative effect, on acquisition outcomes. Furthermore, the acquirer CEO's throughput background and acquisition experience negatively moderate, whereas the target's innovation resource quality and the acquirer's marketing intensity positively moderate, the influence of innovation overlap. The target's relational resource quality and the acquirer CEO's throughput background positively moderate the influence of relational overlap.",1
Perceived Export Performance: A Contingent Measurement Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Despite considerable research on export performance, relatively little scholarly attention has been devoted to incorporating managers? perspectives into operationalizing this concept. This study proposes a new approach for measuring small and medium-sized enterprises? export performance in the presence of multiple, potentially conflicting, goals while accounting for different approaches to assessing export performance. Adopting a contingency approach, the authors develop two customized measures of perceived export performance: the individualized perceived export performance framework and the simplified model. They demonstrate the application of both measures with a sample of 78 exporting small and medium enterprises in New Zealand and compare the outcomes. The proposed frameworks are intended to measure export performance considering managers? specific priorities and by incorporating manager- and firm-specific differences in the types and importance of goals, indicators, and benchmarks. This article extends the understanding of export performance by proposing a more nuanced and holistic measurement approach that is tailored to individual firms and reflects firm-specific idiosyncrasies.",0
Advertising Spillovers: Evidence from Online Field Experiments and Implications for Returns on Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The author analyzes the impact of online ads on the advertiser's competitors, using data from randomized field experiments on a restaurant-search website. He finds that ads increase the chances of sales for nonadvertised restaurants significantly. The spillover benefits are concentrated on restaurants that serve the advertiser's cuisine and have a high rating on the restaurant-search website. The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader reminder.",1
An Experimental Investigation of the Effects of Retargeted Advertising: The Role of Frequency and Timing,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In collaboration with an online seller of home-improvement products, the authors conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment to study the effects of retargeted advertising, a form of internet advertising in which banner ads are displayed to users after they visit the advertiser?s website. They find that switching on experimental retargeting causes 14.6% more users to return to the website within four weeks. The impact of retargeting decreases as the time since the consumer first visited the website increases?indeed, 33% of the effect of the first week?s advertising occurs on the first day. Furthermore, the authors find evidence of the existence of complementarities in advertising over time: the effect of advertising in week 2 of the campaign is higher when the user was assigned to a nonzero level of advertising in week 1. The authors discuss mechanisms that can explain their findings and demonstrate a novel low-cost method that can be applied generally to conduct valid online advertising experiments.",1
Consumer Options: Theory and an Empirical Application to a Sports Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors introduce the concept of consumer options and empirically validate it in the context of event ticket pricing. They demonstrate that consumer options can protect consumers from the downside related to uncertain outcomes and enhance seller profits by enabling superior market segmentation and increasing consumer willingness to pay. The authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she can decide whether to exercise the option. The authors present a simple analytical model of consumer options in this setting. Then, they empirically demonstrate that profits under option pricing can exceed those from (1) advance selling and (2) pricing after uncertainty is resolved. The analysis and findings of this article lay a foundation for future work on consumer options in marketing.",1
Is that Deal Worth my Time? The Interactive Effect of Relative and Referent Thinking on Willingness to Seek a Bargain,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers? reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets.",0
All Things Considered? the Role of Choice Set Formation in Diversification,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The diversification effect, a tendency toward greater variety as multiple choices are made simultaneously, in advance of consumption, is a robust and important phenomenon. Researchers have typically explained the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by which people select items from among those available. This precludes the possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets themselves?that is, how people decide which options to consider when making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in multiple- versus single- item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose simultaneously choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent) choice set. These findings cannot be attributed to alternative patterns of covariation, including latent error correlations; to temporal stochastic inflation; or to unobserved heterogeneity.",1
The Role of Culture in International Relationship Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2014,"International relationships are increasingly critical to business performance. Yet despite a recent surge in international research on relationship marketing (RM), it is unclear whether or how RM should be adapted across cultures. The authors adopt Hofstede's dimensions of culture to conduct a comprehensive, multivariate, metaregression analysis of 47,864 relationships across 170 studies, 36 countries, and six continents. To guide theory, they propose four tenets that parsimoniously capture the essence of culture's effects on RM. Study 1 affirms these tenets and emphasizes the importance of taking a fine-grained perspective to understand the role of culture in RM because of the high degree of heterogeneity across different cultural dimensions and RM linkages. For example, the magnitude of individualism's effect is 71% greater on RM than other cultural dimensions, whereas masculinity has almost no effect; however, accounting only for individualism ignores significant moderating effects of power distance and uncertainty avoidance dimensions. To guide managers, Study 2 adopts a country-level approach and reveals that RM is much more effective outside the United States such that relationships are 55% more effective, on average, for increasing business performance in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.",0
Poisoning Relationships: Perceived Unfairness in Channels of Distribution,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Understanding how relationships are damaged is a critical component in building and preserving strong distribution channels. Using longitudinal data from a Fortune 500 firm and its channel members, this research shows that perceived unfairness truly acts as ?relationship poison? by directly damaging relationships, aggravating the negative effects of both conflict and opportunism, and undermining the benefits of using contracts to manage channel relationships. Surprisingly, at low levels of perceived unfairness, conflict and opportunism have small or even insignificant effects on channel member outcomes, which implies that research investigating the negative impact of conflict and opportunism on exchange outcomes may need reevaluation because these effects are contingent and may vary depending on the levels of perceived unfairness. In addition, the findings support the premise that using contracts to manage channel relationships represents a double-edged sword that suppresses the negative effects of conflict and opportunism while aggravating the negative effect of unfairness.",0
Strategic Considerations in European Retailing,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"The Single Market Initiative (SMI) has resulted in many changes in European retailing. This study explores the influences of the SMI on the European retail sector and discusses the strategic trends emerging from recent changes. The study is based on secondary sources of data as well as on personal interviews throughout Europe. The results indicate that although retailing in Europe remains fragmented, very competitive, and dominated by small and medium-sized firms, large, world-class retailers are emerging/entering the European retailing scene and intensifying competition.",0
International Relationship Marketing: Intellectual Foundations and Avenues for Further Research,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Relationship marketing is a central and important tenet in marketing thought, and considerable research effort in the discipline has been devoted to examining various facets of relationship marketing, resulting in a large body of knowledge. In this study, the authors specifically focus on the international dimension of the relationship marketing literature and use citation and cocitation data to identify and unfold its intellectual foundations. The goal is to provide new and meaningful avenues for further research using the knowledge structure on which international relationship marketing stands. The examination of the literature spans more than 40 years, divided into three time periods that permit detection of longitudinal trends as well as meaningful visual representations of the cocitation data. Overall, the authors survey 29 key publications and identify 3,509 articles that include 230,684 citations, examining the data for 1972?1993, 1994?2003, and 2004?2013 to unfold research possibilities. Drawing on the analysis of emergent multidimensional scaling results, the authors discuss potential international relationship marketing research incorporating social relations and networking, new ventures, internationalization, trust and commitment, tacit knowledge, and cultural values.",0
International Marketing Strategy in Emerging-Market Exporting Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Unlike their counterparts in developed markets, emerging-market firms are characterized by limited resources, including international experience and access to relevant information, which are essential for developing suitable international marketing strategy (IMS). Under such circumstances, strategies are expected to produce suboptimal results, especially when targeting competitive markets in advanced economies. Prior IMS research has largely focused on developed markets. In contrast, the authors examine IMS of exporters in Thailand, an emerging market. Despite major differences in environments and processes in emerging markets, they establish that Thai exporters that match their IMS to local market conditions realize superior performance, as predicated by strategy coalignment. The authors validate these results and discuss emerging-market firms? capacity to adapt their strategies and succeed in highly competitive advanced economies, despite relative inexperience, volatility, and information asymmetry at home. Exporting remains of critical importance to the economies of emerging markets, and the findings provide greater optimism for their firms? ability to address host-market conditions in their marketing strategies, as well as pointing to the competitive threat posed by these emerging-market neophytes.",0
"Intentional Cannibalization, Radical Innovation, and Performance: A Comparison of Chinese and Western Enterprises in China",Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Research contrasting the marketing strategies of foreign and domestic firms within local markets is scarce but is of critical importance to both types of firms. This research examines how intentional cannibalization (IC) functions in Western and Chinese enterprises operating in China and evaluates IC?s impact on radical innovation and subsequent performance while accounting for the moderating effects of cost leadership and differentiation strategies. The investigation uncovers important marketing strategy concerns for firms competing in emerging markets such as China. The results demonstrate that IC on its own correlates with radical innovation for Western firms, but not for Chinese firms. For Chinese firms, the link between IC and radical innovation becomes significant only in combination with a cost leadership strategy. For Western firms, the link between IC and radical innovation is strengthened when these firms pursue a differentiation strategy and, in contrast to Chinese firms, radical innovation mediates the effect between IC and performance. Thus, the way IC and radical innovation affect performance varies across Western and Chinese enterprises. These findings bolster and extend research regarding strategies of local and nonlocal firms in home markets.",0
Strategic Variables that Influence Entry Mode Choice in Service Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This work investigates how a firm's international strategy affects choice of entry mode in the service sector. The inherent complexity associated with studying a heterogeneous sector such as services requires researchers to investigate variables that go beyond those drawn from traditional empirical work on the manufacturing sector. The adoption of a broader theoretical perspective and the introduction of these new variables may well provide further evidence of the determinants of service firms? entry mode choices. On the basis of 174 entry decisions of service firms, this study's results support the necessity of including additional strategic variables that specifically address this complex phenomenon, a decision that is not always associated just with efficiency and value-based considerations but with strategic issues as well. In addition, some variables that are routinely used in studies of the manufacturing sector were not significant or exhibited different results in different groups of service activities.",0
Designing Conjoint Choice Experiments Using Managers' Prior Beliefs,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The authors provide more efficient designs for conjoint choice experiments based on prior information elicited from managers about the parameters and their associated uncertainty. The authors use a Bayesian design procedure that assumes a prior distribution of likely parameter values and optimizes the design over that distribution. The authors propose a way to elicit prior information from managers and show in Monte Carlo studies that the procedure provides more efficient designs than the current procedures. The authors provide an empirical application, in which they elicit prior information on the parameter values and the associated uncertainty from managers. Here, the Bayesian design provides 30%-50% lower standard errors of the estimates and an expected predictive validity that is approximately 20% higher.",1
Heterogeneous Conjoint Choice Designs,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Previous conjoint choice design construction procedures have produced a single homogeneous design that is administered to all study participants. In contrast, this article proposes to construct a limited set of different designs. The principle of heterogeneous designs is applicable to a variety of types of models. This article illustrates this principle for Bayesian designs, taking into account prior uncertainty about the parameter values, and for mixed logit designs that accommodate respondent heterogeneity. The authors develop and investigate a computational procedure that enables quick and easy implementation. Although the number of different designs in the optimal set is small, the authors use a Monte Carlo study to demonstrate that their heterogeneous design achieves substantial gains in efficiency compared with homogeneous designs.",1
Executive Insights: Globalization of the Auto Parts Industry,Journal of International Marketing,1997,Over the past 15 years the auto industry has shifted from a regional industry to a global industry. As a result of this shift the original equipment supplier base has been pulled in the same direction. The globalization process has paralleled the consolidation of the supplier base that has taken place. These two trends have brought new challenges and opportunities to the supplier community.,0
The Impact of a Complement-Based Assortment Organization on Purchases,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"This article examines whether and why organizing product categories according to the consumption goal they serve (i.e., complement-based assortment organization) may increase purchases compared with organizing product categories according to their attributes or physical characteristics (i.e., substitute-based assortment organization). Across two field experiments, a virtual reality experiment, and a lab experiment, the authors show that a complement-based assortment organization, compared with a substitute-based assortment organization, leads to increased numbers of purchases and increased expenditures. Ease of visualization of the consumption process mediates the results. The impact of the complement-based organization on purchases is more pronounced for less involved consumers and for consumers with a less specific shopping goal. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications.",1
Implementing Changes in Marketing Strategy: The Role of Perceived Outcome-and Process-Oriented Supervisory Actions,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This study investigates the role of supervisors in implementing changes in marketing strategy. The authors propose that perceptions of outcome-oriented supervisory actions influence salespeople's primary appraisals of a strategic change (i.e., whether the change will affect them) and that perceptions of process-oriented supervisory actions influence salespeople's secondary appraisals (i.e., whether they can cope with the impact of the change on them). The results from a study of 828 salespeople in 204 branches of a large distributor of industrial goods provide evidence that perceived outcome risk containment and outcome reward emphasis enhance primary appraisals, whereas perceived process risk containment and process reward emphasis enhance secondary appraisals. In turn, the authors find that salespeople's primary and secondary appraisals influence their change implementation behaviors, leading to successful change implementation. Notably, they also find that (outcome and process) risk containment has a greater influence on appraisals of salespeople with a higher performance orientation, but the effects of (outcome and process) reward emphases are invariant across salespeople's performance orientation. The findings suggest that successful implementation of strategic change may depend not merely or even primarily on giving rewards to salespeople for implementing change but also on limiting salespeople's risks and recognizing them for their change-related efforts.",1
The Effect of Reward Structures on the Performance of Cross-Functional Product Development Teams,Journal of Marketing,2001,"This study examines the effect of reward structures on the performance of cross-functional product development teams. Results suggest that when it is easy to evaluate individual performances, position-based differential rewards lead to greater satisfaction. For long and complex projects, process-based rewards have a negative effect and outcome-based rewards have a positive effect on performance. For risky projects and highly competitive or relatively stable industries, a nonlinear and monotonically decreasing relationship exists between outcome-based rewards and product quality.",0
Temporal Differentiation and the Market for Second Opinions,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The author studies the pricing of information with private value (e.g., management consulting, legal advice, medical diagnosis). Anecdotal evidence shows that in some of these markets, competing information sellers split the business to sell only first or second opinions to their customers. The author explains this pricing practice by showing that second-opinion markets are a result of temporal differentiation.",1
Copy Alert: A Method and Metric to Detect Visual Copycat Brands,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The authors propose a method and metric to quantify the consumer confusion between leading brands and copycat brands that results from the visual similarity of their packaging designs. The method has three components. First, image processing techniques establish the objective similarity of the packages of leading and copycat brands on the basis of their colors and textures. Second, a perceptual decision task (triangle test) assesses the accuracy and speed with which consumers can identify differences between brands from rapidly (300 milliseconds) flashed images of their packages. Third, a competing accumulator model describes the buildup of evidence on each of the alternative brands during consumers? perceptual decisions and predicts the accuracy and response time of brand identification. Jointly, these components establish the impact of copycat packaging's visual features on consumer confusion. The method is applied in a test of experimentally designed copycats and market copycats in 15 product categories. A three-tiered metric (?copy alert,? ?copy watch,? and ?copy safe?) establishes the extent to which copycat brands imitate the package designs of target brands and identifies which visual features are responsible.",1
Giving against the Odds: When Tempting Alternatives Increase Willingness to Donate,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors examine how a reference to an unrelated product in the choice context affects consumers? likelihood of donating to charity. Building on research on self-signaling, the authors predict that consumers are more likely to give when the donation appeal references a hedonic product than when a utilitarian product is referenced or when no comparison is provided. They posit that this phenomenon occurs because referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product. Finally, consistent with these experimental findings, a field experiment shows that referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal increases real donation rates in a nonlaboratory setting. The authors discuss the theoretical implications for both consumer decision making and the self-signaling motives behind prosocial choice.",1
The Readability of Marketing Journals: Are Award-Winning Articles Better Written?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This is a study of the readability of articles in four marketing journals: Journal of Marketing, Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of International Marketing, and Journal of Public Policy & Marketing. For each journal, the authors compare articles that have won an award with articles that have not. The authors find that award-winning articles are more readable, as measured by indexes focusing on sentence and word length, than nonwinning articles. The authors also identify and analyze other characteristics of more readable journal articles and discuss the importance of good writing.",0
How Brand Community Practices Create Value,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Using social practice theory, this article reveals the process of collective value creation within brand communities. Moving beyond a single case study, the authors examine previously published research in conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of value-creating practices. Practices have an ?anatomy? consisting of (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3) emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms.",0
Principles and Principals: Do Customer Stewardship and Agency Control Compete or Complement When Shaping Frontline Employee Behavior?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"This article introduces customer stewardship control (CSC) to the marketing field. This concept represents a frontline employee's felt ownership of and moral responsibility for customers? overall welfare. In two studies, the authors show that CSC is a more encompassing construct than customer orientation, which reflects a frontline employee's focus on meeting customers? needs. They provide evidence that the former is more potent in shaping in- and extra-role employee behaviors. Moreover, they highlight how CSC operates in conjunction with an organization's agency control system: Stewardship's positive influence on in- and extra-role behavior is weaker in the presence of high agency control. They offer actionable advice about how to solve the resulting managerial control dilemma. Finally, the authors show that CSC depends on drivers that reside at the individual level (employee relatedness), the team level (team competence), or both levels of aggregation (employee and team autonomy). These findings show how to effectively design a frontline employee's work environment to ensure optimal frontline performance.",0
When Does International Marketing Standardization Matter to Firm Performance?,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"The topic of standardization of international marketing programs represents an important issue faced by managers of global firms and has attracted significant research attention. Although previous research has established that standardization enhances performance outcomes, more recent theorizing suggests that this may not always be the case. However, empirical investigators have paid little systematic attention to moderating conditions. The major purpose of this article is to investigate the organizational factors that moderate the standardization?performance relationship and, thus, to explore the types of firm for which standardization is particularly beneficial. The authors examine survey data from 489 firms, and their results indicate that the standardization?performance link is significantly stronger for large firms with a homogeneous product offering, high levels of global market penetration, a cost leadership strategy, and strong coordination capabilities. The authors conclude that managers evaluating the adequacy of a standardization strategy should consider the list of contingencies advanced in this research.",0
"A Country-of-Origin Perspective on Climate Change Actions: Evidence from France, Morocco, and the United States",Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Country-of-origin (COO) research cites the influence of country-level actions on consumers? attitudes but does not specify how such actions might influence the COO image, particularly in a climate change context. However, various countries adopt different climate change actions, with notable potential implications for products associated with the nations? images; therefore, it is vital to understand the relationship between climate change actions and consumers? attitudes toward their country. This study, which solicits responses from 1,389 consumers in France, Morocco, and the United States, investigates whether and how climate change actions influence each COO image and consumers? attitudes toward it, which vary with consumers? level of climate change concern. Such climate change actions also exert distinct effects that are moderated by the cultural context. Therefore, this study extends the COO literature to a climate change context and provides relevant implications for policy makers and marketing managers aiming to improve their COO image.",0
Fitting International Segmentation for Emerging Markets: Conceptual Development and Empirical Illustration,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"The increasing attractiveness of emerging markets (EMs), alongside the progression of internationalization, raises the question whether setting up a unified marketing strategy for EMs and high-income countries is appropriate. In this study, the authors use institutionally induced heterogeneity, which refers to distinct consumer patterns evoked by contextual differences, to elaborate on the requirements of an international segmentation that includes EMs, such as microlevel analyses and the inclusion of institutional effects. The authors numerically illustrate the established requirements by applying a multilevel finite mixture modeling of global consumer multichannel (search and purchase) behavior. Doing so provides an initial large-scale analysis that compares consumers from EMs and high-income countries. The findings broadly support the suggested requirements, contributing to the international segmentation and EM literature. Practitioners can apply the insights of this investigation to establish an international marketing strategy. The key recommendation proposes that a case-by-case analysis of EMs is necessary and that solely considering EMs derives incorrect conclusions about international segmentation.",0
Converting Web Site Visitors into Buyers: How Web Site Investment Increases Consumer Trusting Beliefs and Online Purchase Intentions,Journal of Marketing,2006,The authors investigate the impact of Web site design investments on consumers? trusting beliefs and online purchase intentions. Such investments signal the component of trusting beliefs that is most strongly related to online purchase intentions: ability. These effects were strongest when consumers? goals were to search rather than to browse and when purchases involved risk.,0
Referral Programs and Customer Value,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Referral programs have become a popular way to acquire customers. Yet there is no evidence to date that customers acquired through such programs are more valuable than other customers. The authors address this gap and investigate the extent to which referred customers are more profitable and more loyal. Tracking approximately 10,000 customers of a leading German bank for almost three years, the authors find that referred customers (1) have a higher contribution margin, though this difference erodes over time; (2) have a higher retention rate, and this difference persists over time; and (3) are more valuable in both the short and the long run. The average value of a referred customer is at least 16% higher than that of a nonreferred customer with similar demographics and time of acquisition. However, the size of the value differential varies across customer segments; therefore, firms should use a selective approach for their referral programs.",0
Understanding the Impact of Relationship Disruptions,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Personal relationships between salespeople and customers are essential for the success of business-to-business relationships, and research has shown that a change of the salesperson can severely harm financial performance. However, such interpersonal relationship disruptions may also have positive effects by encouraging vitalizing reexplorations of the relationship. Using multilevel loyalty theory and relationship life cycle theory, the authors offer a comprehensive conceptualization of potentially countervailing consequences of relationship disruptions. In particular, disruptions may have different effects on resale revenue (from previously sold products) versus new sale revenue (from newly sold products), contingent on both the history and expected future development of the relationship. Therefore, this study examines moderators on the firm-level relationship prior to disruption and salesperson relationship management afterward. Longitudinal data from 2,040 customers of an international business-to-business firm reveal that a disruption can increase overall performance by more than 29%, depending on the firm-level relationship before disruption and the new salesperson?s relationship management. Managers can use these findings proactively to evaluate and manage the risks and opportunities involved in relationship disruptions.",0
Managing Customer and Organizational Complexity in Sales Organizations,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Salespeople face increasingly complex work environments, both externally with customers and internally with various departments in their own organizations. Because managing such customer and organizational complexity is crucial to performance, the authors conceptualize and develop measures of customer and organizational complexity and examine the effects on salesperson outcomes. In line with job demands-resources theory, salespeople leverage personal and supervisory resources to manage complexity. The test of the conceptual model uses matched salespeople?sales manager data gathered from a large business-to-business firm. The empirical findings reveal that personal resources (sales self-efficacy) help manage complexity in general but create greater role stress in the face of customer complexity. The effectiveness of supervisory resources (transactional leadership behavior) is contingent on the type of complexity and the personal resources available to a salesperson. These results indicate not only how salespeople manage different complexities but also how sales managers should adapt their leadership behaviors to enhance salesperson performance.",0
Cross-Selling Performance in Complex Selling Contexts: An Examination of Supervisory- and Compensation-Based Controls,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although cross-selling offers significant benefits for both vendors and customers, three-quarters of all cross-selling initiatives fail, typically for sales force?related reasons. Prior research examining the antecedents of salespeople's product adoption has not yet shown whether or under which conditions such adoption behavior leads to better salesperson cross-selling performance. The authors develop a model of the role of supervisory behavior, compensation-based controls, and their interactions in enhancing the effect of salespeople's adoption behavior on cross-selling performance in a complex selling context. To test the model, the authors use a matched, multilevel data set from company records and surveys of salespeople and sales managers working in a biotech firm. The analysis shows that transformational leadership enhances the effect of salespeople's product portfolio adoption on cross-selling performance, whereas transactional leadership diminishes the effect. Furthermore, the effect of leadership type depends on whether cross-selling incentives are provided: the positive performance effect of transformational leadership is crowded out when monetary incentives are provided, and the negative effect of transactional leadership becomes even more negative. These results have significant theoretical and managerial implications.",0
Measuring Consumer Preferences for Complex Products: A Compositional Approach BasedonPaired Comparisons,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Conjoint analysis has become a widely accepted tool for preference measurement in marketing research, though its applicability and performance strongly depend on the complexity of the product or service. Therefore, self-explicated approaches are still frequently used because of their simple design, which facilitates preference elicitation when large numbers of attributes need to be considered. However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using complex, high-involvement products. They find that PCPM yields better results than the benchmark approaches with respect to interview length, individual hit rates, and aggregate choice share predictions.",1
The Innovation Effect of User Design: Exploring Consumers? Innovation Perceptions of Firms Selling Products Designed by Users,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors study consumer perceptions of firms that sell products designed by users. In contrast with the traditional design mode, in which professional designers employed by firms handle the design task, common design by users involves the firm's user community in creating new product designs for the broader consumer market. In the course of four studies, the authors find that common design by users does not decrease but actually enhances consumers? perceptions of a firm's innovation ability. This ?innovation effect of user design? leads to positive outcomes with respect to purchase intentions, willingness to pay, and consumers? willingness to recommend the firm to others. The authors identify four defining characteristics of common design by users that underlie this innovation inference; namely, the number of consumers, the diversity of their background, the lack of company constraints, and the fact that consumer designers actually use the designed product all contribute in building positive perceptions. Finally, the authors identify consumer familiarity with user innovation and the design task's complexity as important moderators that create boundary conditions for the innovation effect of user design.",0
Complicating Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"A great deal of research in consumer decision making and social cognition has explored consumers? attempts to simplify choices by bolstering their tentative choice candidate and/or denigrating the other alternatives. The current research investigates a diametrically opposed process, whereby consumers complicate their decisions. The authors demonstrate that to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice conflict by overweighting small disadvantages of superior alternatives, converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing preference ordering, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Furthermore, the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework: the effort?compatibility principle. Specifically, the authors argue that consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate and the effort that they actually exert. When a decision seems more difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues. However, when the decision seems easier to resolve than anticipated (e.g., when consumers face an important yet easy choice), consumers artificially increase their effort.",1
Executive Insights: Real Differences between Local and International Brands: Strategic Implications for International Marketers,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"In the current context of globalization, firms have concentrated their efforts on the development of international brands. As a result, international brand portfolios have been restructured, and many successful local brands have been eliminated. This article's objective is to improve the understanding of local brand differences and competitive advantages relative to international brands. To achieve this, the authors reanalyzed the Young & Rubicam database Brand Asset Valuator and examined more than 744 brands across the four largest countries in Europe: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy. The authors discuss the managerial implications of the findings for international marketers as they develop their ideal international brand portfolios.",0
Not All Fun and Games: Viral Marketing for Utilitarian Products,Journal of Marketing,2014,"The success of products such as FarmVille has prompted many firms to engage in viral marketing on Facebook and other social media websites. Yet is the viral marketing approach adopted for games suitable for other, more utilitarian products? This study aims to answer questions that link product characteristics and contexts to viral marketing success: Should primarily utilitarian products rely on the same sharing mechanisms for their viral marketing campaigns as less utilitarian products? If not, why is this the case, and how should viral marketing for primarily utilitarian products differ? This empirical study analyzes the Facebook viral marketing campaigns of 751 products and reveals that the same sharing mechanism that made FarmVille so successful is the worst possible mechanism for promoting primarily utilitarian products. These findings are in line with theory from social psychology: because consumers do not visit Facebook to learn about utilitarian products, they rely on simple cues and heuristics to process viral marketing messages about these products. This study thus contributes to literature on viral marketing in general and sharing mechanisms in particular; it also offers practical, hands-on recommendations to marketing managers in charge of designing viral marketing campaigns for both more and less utilitarian products.",0
Linking Customer and Financial Metrics to Shareholder Value: The Leverage Effect in Customer-Based Valuation,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Customers are the most important assets of most companies, such that customer equity has been used as a proxy for shareholder value. However, linking customer metrics to shareholder value without considering debt and non-operating assets ignores their effects on relative changes in customer equity and leads to biased estimates. In developing a new theoretical framework for customer-based valuation, grounded in valuation theory, this article links the value of all customers to shareholder value and introduces a new leverage effect that can translate percentage changes in customer equity into shareholder value. The average leverage effect in more than 2000 companies across ten years is 1.55, which indicates that a 10% increase in customer equity is amplified to a 15.5% increase in shareholder value. This research also compares the influence of customer and financial metrics on shareholder value. The findings challenge previous notions about the dominant effect of the retention rate and underline the importance of predicting the number of future acquired customers for a company.",0
Targeted Online Advertising: Using Reciprocity Appeals to Increase Acceptance among Users of Free Web Services,Journal of Marketing,2014,"The Internet is dominated by free web services that depend on advertising revenues and powerful marketing tools to support their business models. Targeted online advertising enables websites to increase their advertising revenues by selectively displaying advertisements according to users? browsing behavior, sociodemographics, and interests. Yet targeting also creates negative consumer reactions, and websites confront increasing regulatory pressures to inform consumers about their practices. It is critical for such advertising-supported websites to address those challenges proactively. In one scenario experiment and two field studies, the authors show that a normative reciprocity argument is generally more effective than the current industry practice of using a utilitarian argument related to advertising relevance to increase acceptance of targeted online advertising. However, in some cases, this dominance switches depending on specific website characteristics such as website utility and level of user-generated content. Managers of free websites should remind their users of the free services they enjoy when asking permission to target them online or to use their personal information.",0
Cross-Cultural Differences in the Effect of Received Word-of-Mouth Referral in Relational Service Exchange,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Because of suggested beneficial effects of word-of-mouth (WOM) referral, service companies have invested large amounts of money in customer referral programs as well as programs aimed at fostering positive communication among their existing customers. The question of cross-cultural differences in the effectiveness of WOM has recently gained increased prominence. The authors contribute to research on this topic by proposing a positive effect of received WOM on service quality perceptions among existing customers. Moreover, they predict that cultural values moderate this effect. They test the model on 1910 bank customers in 11 countries. The results show that received WOM has a positive effect on customer service quality perceptions. Furthermore, received WOM has a stronger effect on the evaluation of customers in high-uncertainty-avoidance than in low-uncertainty-avoidance cultures. No other cultural value is a significant moderator. The results imply that received WOM is also important to existing customers and that managers should adjust their strategy of referral marketing to match their target group's uncertainty-avoidance level.",0
Executive Insights: Global Business Exchanges?Similarities and Differences around the World,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"Because cultures differ at a fundamental level, the knowledge, experience, and ability to conduct business successfully in one culture does not necessarily transfer to another. Learning and mastering the cultural nuances of every cultural group in the world is an ideal goal in the global marketplace, but not a realistic one. The Culture Classification Model examines cultural differences from a broad behavioral perspective and provides a framework for comparisons across groups. Each business exchange will be unique and may deviate from this model, but it provides a starting point when preparing for a business exchange with someone from another culture.",0
Are Consumers Too Trusting? The Effects of Relationships with Expert Advisers,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Many important and complex consumer decisions rely on the advice of trusted professional experts. Many experts, however, such as doctors, financial advisers, and accountants, may be prone to conflicts of interest. As such, consumers may seek a second opinion. A series of studies investigate consumers? reluctance to seek additional advice in the context of having an ongoing relationship with one expert service provider. The authors find evidence in health care claims that long-term relationships contribute to more expensive, but not necessarily better, treatment. In addition, a series of experiments show that people recognize when they could benefit from a second opinion but are more reluctant to do so when thinking about their own providers rather than someone else's. Further studies test a relationship maintenance hypothesis and show that consumers? reluctance to seek second opinions is partially driven by their motivation to preserve relationship harmony, even when it is at their own personal expense and well-being. Taken together, these results provide important insight into the potential limitations and consequences of longstanding relationships between consumers and experts.",1
"Feelings, Fit, and Funny Effects: A Situated Cognition Perspective",Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Recent research has documented numerous, apparently irrational influences on consumer judgment and choice, from the influence of temporary moods and metacognitive experiences to the role of ?feeling right? about a decision strategy. From the metatheoretical perspective of situated cognition, such findings reflect the pragmatic, situated, and embodied nature of human cognition, which usually serves people well. Avnet and Higgins's (2006) target article extends the understanding of these processes by identifying the metacognitive experience of feeling right and by emphasizing the role of self-regulatory focus in judgment and decision making.",1
A Feature-Based Approach to Assessing Advertisement Similarity,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"This research presents a feature-based statistical model and subsequently explores the degree to which similarity perceptions between two advertisements can be decomposed and explained by a ?weighted-and-summed? distance measure, computed on the advertisements' executional elements, after controlling for familiarity and viewers' attitudinal responses toward the advertisements. Furthermore, the authors obtain empirical findings in two major areas: First, variation in similarity ratings can be explained by the advertisements' features, a finding of potential importance for advertisement construction. Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in the literature) to drive recall and persuasion are effective at driving perceptions of similarity. This is of practical importance because managers want their advertisements not only to be liked and remembered but also (possibly) to be perceived as similar (or dissimilar) to those for other products. In particular, an understanding of which items drive which constructs (recall and persuasion, or similarity) can contribute to a more effective overall marketing strategy.",1
Understanding Service Retention within and across Cohorts using Limited Information,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Service churn and retention rates remain central as constructs in marketing activities, such as valuation of service subscribers and resource allocation. Although extant approaches have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors, such as reported satisfaction, marketing-mix activities, and so on, managers often face situations in which the only information available is the duration for which subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service churn and understand the contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting. Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1) duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects (e.g., seasonality). Then, they apply the framework to subscription databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service churn (and to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does not significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence also contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these results to understand how the expected value of a subscription differs across model specifications. They find considerable variation across model specifications, indicating that model misspecification can affect resource allocation decisions and other marketing efforts that are important to a firm.",0
Predictors of the Gap between Program and Commercial Audiences: An Investigation using Live Tuning Data,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Audience measures serve as the basis on which billions of dollars of television advertising are purchased each year. However, these measures often fall short of providing marketers and media planners with information about the size of the audience that has the opportunity to see advertisements during commercial breaks. Although program audience measures remain relevant for product placement, the size of the gap between the audience potentially exposed to programming and the audience exposed to commercial breaks has implications for advertisers and networks, affecting decisions such as program selection and ad pricing. The authors use a full television season of live tuning data to study variation across programs in the size of the program audience and the size of the gap between the potential program audiences and the potential commercial audiences, which is found to exceed 20% of the program audience in some cases. Across program genres, the authors find that dramas have increased program popularity and reduced ad avoidance, whereas reality television experiences increased ad avoidance. The analysis reveals the importance of incorporating show-specific random effects because their omission can result in spurious attribution of differences in ad avoidance and program popularity to genre. The authors discuss the implications for networks and advertisers.",0
Listening in on Social Media: A Joint Model of Sentiment and Venue Format Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"In this research, the authors jointly model the sentiment expressed in social media posts and the venue format to which it was posted as two interrelated processes in an effort to provide a measure of underlying brand sentiment. Using social media data from firms in two distinct industries, they allow the content of the post and the underlying sentiment toward the brand to affect both processes. The results show that the inferences marketing researchers obtain from monitoring social media are dependent on where they ?listen? and that common approaches that either focus on a single social media venue or ignore differences across venues in aggregated data can lead to misleading brand sentiment metrics. The authors validate the approach by comparing their model-based measure of brand sentiment with performance measures obtained from external data sets (stock prices for both brands and an offline brand-tracking study for one brand). They find that their measure of sentiment serves as a leading indicator of the changes observed in these external data sources and outperforms other social media metrics currently used.",1
Binge Watching and Advertising,Journal of Marketing,2016,"How users consume media has shifted dramatically as viewers migrate from traditional broadcast channels toward online channels. Rather than following the schedule dictated by television networks and consuming one episode of a series each week, many viewers now engage in binge watching, which involves consuming several episodes of the same series in a condensed period of time. In this research, the authors decompose users? viewing behavior into (1) whether the user continues the viewing session after each episode viewed, (2) whether the next episode viewed is from the same or a different series, and (3) the time elapsed between sessions. Applying this modeling framework to data provided by Hulu.com, a popular online provider of broadcast and cable television shows, the authors examine the drivers of binge watching behavior, distinguishing between user-level traits and states determined by previously viewed content. The authors simultaneously investigate users? response to advertisements. Many online video providers support their services with advertising revenue; thus, understanding how users respond to advertisements and how advertising affects subsequent viewing is of paramount importance to both advertisers and online video providers. The results of the study reveal that advertising responsiveness differs between bingers and nonbingers and that it changes over the course of online viewing sessions. The authors discuss the implications of their results for advertisers and online video platforms.",0
Judging the Book by Its Cover? how Consumers Decode Conspicuous Consumption Cues in Buyer?Seller Relationships,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Little empirical consumer research has focused on the decoding of conspicuous symbolism, that is, the inferences consumers make about others? conspicuous consumption. Grounded in theory on social perception and role congruity, four experiments show that consumer inferences about and behavioral intentions toward conspicuous sellers are moderated by communal and exchange relationship norms. Specifically, conspicuous consumption by a seller decreases warmth inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions toward the seller under the communal norm; conversely, it increases competence inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions under the exchange norm. A seller's mere wealth triggers similar inferences, suggesting that conspicuous consumption is a surrogate for actual wealth. Priming consumers with persuasion knowledge inhibits the inferential benefits resulting from conspicuousness under the exchange norm. These findings reveal the theoretically meaningful role of the consumption context by showing that consumers? warmth and competence inferences operate differentially in commercial relationships as a result of salient communal versus exchange norms, with important consequences for consumers? behavioral intentions.",1
Transaction Cost Economics in International Marketing: A Review and Suggestions for the Future,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Transaction cost economics (TCE) has received much attention in the international marketing literature over the past 25 years. Many key issues in international marketing have been examined through the lens of TCE, including entry mode choice, the governance of international distribution channels, propensity to franchise, international pricing control, and the governance of international buyer?supplier relationships. The author presents a review and analysis of 43 empirical TCE international marketing studies from 1987 to the present day. The results from this review and analysis indicate that the extant international marketing TCE studies demonstrate some support for the TCE propositions. In addition to these findings, the author also notes some key measurement issues, issues involving the dominance of U.S.-based studies, and some data equivalence issues. He builds on the results of the analysis to lay out important future research directions in the TCE international marketing domain.",0
What does it Take to Get Promoted in Marketing Academia? Understanding Exceptional Publication Productivity in the Leading Marketing Journals,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Institutional competition to retain and recruit marketing scholars capable of publishing in the leading marketing journals has intensified. Although increased emphasis has been placed on publication productivity in the leading marketing journals, little is known about questions such as (1) What level of publication productivity in the leading marketing journals does it take to get promoted in marketing academia? (2) What level of publication productivity in the leading marketing journals warrants exception? and (3) What drives research productivity in the leading marketing journals? The authors draw on the economic concept of imperfect substitution to address these questions using two data sets: (1) a census of publication activity in the leading marketing journals of 337 scholars in the top 70 institutions who were promoted between 1992 and 2006 and (2) an examination of 2672 scholars who published 3492 articles in the four leading marketing journals over the 1982?2006 period. The results indicate that the average number of publications by successful candidates for promotion to associate professor from PhD conferral at the top 10 institutions was .57 articles in the leading marketing journals per year, compared with .47 in the top 11?20 institutions, .47 in the top 21?40 institutions, and .26 in the top 41?70 institutions. The authors also present findings related to promotion to full professor both from PhD conferral and from promotion to associate professor, as well as scholars identified as warranting exceptional publication productivity. The findings provide substantive implications for marketing academics, for those involved with the recruitment and retention of marketing academics, and for the field of marketing thought in general.",0
Passive and Active Opportunism in Interorganizational Exchange,Journal of Marketing,2013,"This article examines how firms in interorganizational relationships respond differently to active and passive opportunism and observes how these opportunism forms erode satisfaction with the performance of these relationships. The multimethod approach of two experiments and one longitudinal field study demonstrate that firms tolerate more passive opportunism than active opportunism (Study 1) and that transaction costs play a mediating role between opportunism form and satisfaction with performance of the relationship (Study 2). Finally, the field study reveals that, over time, passive opportunism has a more corrosive impact on satisfaction with performance than active opportunism (Study 3). Together, the findings underscore the importance of distinguishing passive and active opportunism and the need to develop a better understanding of its management and consequences.",0
Do Satisfied Customers Buy More? Examining Moderating Influences in a Retailing Context,Journal of Marketing,2005,"In this research, the authors propose that the relationship between satisfaction and repurchase behavior is moderated by customer, relational, and marketplace characteristics. They further hypothesize that the moderating effects emerge if repurchase is measured as objective behavior but not if it is measured as repurchase intentions. To test for systematic differences in effects, the authors estimate identical models using both longitudinal repurchase measures and survey measures as the dependent variable. The results suggest that the relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase behavior is contingent on the moderating effects of convenience, competitive intensity, customer involvement, and household income. As the authors predicted, the results are significantly different for self-reported repurchase intentions and objective repurchase behavior. The conceptual framework and empirical findings reinforce the importance of moderating influences and offer new insights that enhance the understanding of what drives repurchase behavior.",0
"The Impact of Soda Taxes: Pass-Through, Tax Avoidance, and Nutritional Effects",Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors analyze the impact of a tax on sweetened beverages using a unique data set of prices, quantities sold, and nutritional information across several thousand taxed and untaxed beverages for a large set of stores in Philadelphia and its surrounding area. The tax is passed through at an average rate of 97%, leading to a 34% price increase. Demand in the taxed area decreases by 46% in response to the tax. Cross-shopping to stores outside of Philadelphia offsets more than half of the reduction in sales in the city and decreases the net reduction in sales of taxed beverages to only 22%. There is no significant substitution to bottled water and modest substitution to untaxed natural juices. The authors show that tax avoidance through cross-shopping severely constrains revenue generation and nutritional improvement, thus making geographic coverage an important policy decision.",1
How Attribute Quantity Influences Option Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Products can be described by different numbers of attributes, but can the mere number of attributes presented across a choice set influence what type of options people choose? This article demonstrates that attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare, and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more broadly.",1
Comparison Neglect in Upgrade Decisions,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"To properly evaluate a potential product upgrade, consumers should compare the upgraded option with the product they already own to assess the upgrade's added utility. However, although consumers explicitly and spontaneously acknowledge the importance of comparing the upgrade with the status quo, the authors find that they often fail to do so. Consequently, consumers frequently buy product upgrades that they would not have bought had they followed their own advice. Five experiments, involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading. The experiments suggest that this ?comparison neglect? increases upgrade likelihood by making people overlook the similarities between the upgraded and status quo options and that it persists even when deliberation effort is high. The findings have important implications for theory, marketing practice, and consumer welfare.",1
Beating the Market: The Allure of Unintended Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Consumers face many options that are presented to them as bargains, but in reality, they only subjectively construe a fraction of them as valuable. The authors propose that consumers are particularly attracted to offers they perceive as more valuable than the marketer presumably intended. Consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the marketer's explicit intent. The experiments also suggest that the urge to exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the market. The findings have theoretical implications for understanding consumers? subjective perceptions of value as well as important practical implications for designing customized offers and targeted promotions.",1
Focus! Creative Success is Enjoyed through Restricted Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"A common belief states that more choice of creative inputs boosts consumer creativity because it expands consumers? creative solution space. Two experimental studies, run in a knitting and a crafting context, challenge this intuition and suggest that restricting the choice of creative inputs actually enhances creativity for experienced consumers. The authors find that this outcome is due to consumers? ability to enjoy the creative process more, which in turn positively affects their creative output, as judged by experts. In contrast, consumers perceive themselves as more creative (regardless of experience level) when they have a greater rather than a limited choice of inputs. The authors discuss how these findings open up new avenues for research on creativity and choice overload.",1
Promoting Relationship Learning,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors develop a theory of how management can develop and promote the learning capabilities of targeted customer?supplier relationships. The theory suggests that a supplier and a customer can improve their joint learning activities by facilitating information exchange, developing common learning arenas, and updating their behavior accordingly. The authors suggest that learning within a customer?supplier relationship cannot be mandated by either organization, but rather learning depends on both parties? willingness to cooperate in joint learning activities. Management can promote relationship learning by cultivating a collaborative culture, formulating specific objectives for joint learning activities, and developing relational trust. However, as relational trust develops, the effectiveness of learning is reduced as a result of ?hidden costs? of trust. The authors use data from 315 dyads to test the theory empirically, and they find that the learning capability of a relationship has a strong, positive effect on performance. Their results also provide insight into how to address the hidden costs of trust.",0
Product Quality and Performance in the Internet Age: Evidence from Creationist-Friendly Curriculum,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Curriculum is at the core of school quality. Curriculum changes often attempt to cater to local preferences while adhering to national standards. This tension often drives a school?s decision to invest in curriculum changes even though little is known about how such changes affect student performance. To examine these interrelated issues of product quality and performance in the education sector, the authors analyze the effect of the 2008 Louisiana Science Education Act on students? science test performance in nationally administered tests. The law allowed the teaching of creationism as an alternative ?theory? to evolution in Louisiana schools. Using detailed data on Louisiana schools, the authors employ a difference-in-differences strategy to document that science test achievement declined after the law was passed, relative to schools in neighboring Texas. The effect of the law was driven by regions with high internet penetration and low parental education levels. After the change in policy, Louisiana students were more likely to seek out information on the internet using search terms that led them to web pages that reinforced a creationist message.",1
Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing Better? Consumer Reactions to Corporate Social Responsibility,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"In the face of marketplace polls that attest to the increasing influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on consumers' purchase behavior, this article examines when, how, and for whom specific CSR initiatives work. The findings implicate both company-specific factors, such as the CSR issues a company chooses to focus on and the quality of its products, and individual-specific factors, such as consumers' personal support for the CSR issues and their general beliefs about CSR, as key moderators of consumers' responses to CSR. The results also highlight the mediating role of consumers' perceptions of congruence between their own characters and that of the company in their reactions to its CSR initiatives. More specifically, the authors find that CSR initiatives can, under certain conditions, decrease consumers' intentions to buy a company's products.",1
The Effects of Analyzing Reasons for Brand Preferences: Disruption or Reinforcement?,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"Different streams of research offer seemingly conflicting predictions as to the effects of analyzing reasons for preferences on the attitude-behavior link. The authors apply these different theoretical accounts to a new product scenario and identify conditions under which analyzing reasons for brand preferences can increase or decrease the predictive value of reported preferences. Consistent with dual-process theories of persuasion, in Study 1 the authors find that reasons analysis increases the link between attitude and behavior when the measure of behavior closely follows attitude measurement. In contrast, and consistent with research by Wilson and colleagues (e.g., Wilson et al. 1989) on the disruptive effects of reasons analysis, the authors find that thinking about reasons significantly decreases the attitude?behavior correlation when the observed behavior occurs after a substantial delay. Study 2 not only replicates this finding but also suggests that the timing of the reasons task can be an important moderator of the disruption effect. Specifically, the authors draw on the literature on accountability effects to show that even when there is a delay between attitude and behavior measurement, reasons analysis leads to an increase in the attitude?behavior link, as long as reasons are analyzed after attitude measurement. Finally, in Study 3, the authors validate the account of the effects of reasons analysis by obtaining parallel findings for attitude persistence. Together, the studies offer preliminary advice to both practitioners and academics regarding the potential effects of asking consumers to think about why they like or dislike certain products.",1
Absence Makes the Mind Grow Sharper: Effects of Element Omission on Subsequent Recall,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The authors investigate the memorial consequences of deliberately omitting crucial elements from an advertisement. Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element omission may actually lead to an improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.",1
Understanding Impulsive Eaters' Choice Behaviors: The Motivational Influences of Regulatory Focus,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This research attempts to understand the mechanism underlying the choice behavior of impulsive eaters. The authors propose a process according to which impulsive eaters (versus nonimpulsive eaters) spontaneously develop a promotion focus on exposure to hedonically tempting food, such as chocolate cake; their subsequent decision to consume the food is guided by this promotion orientation. Furthermore, the evoked promotion focus also influences subsequent choices in completely unrelated domains. A set of six experiments provides support for this mechanism and also examines its implications with regard to different ways of correcting impulsive eating behavior.",1
Some Antecedents of Global Strategic Alliance Formation,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"This article investigates equity joint ventures and contracts as alternative cooperative alliance forms in global, high-technology industries. An analysis of 476 strategic alliances finds that equity joint ventures are preferred to contracts when cultural differences between partner firms are greater, and when alliances involve upstream rather than downstream value chain activities. Contrarily, the data show that contracts are preferred to equity joint ventures in cross-industry alliances, and when the technological intensity of the industry sector of cooperation is higher. While the study reinforces earlier findings on cultural similarity, R&D alliances, and technological intensity, the results on industry origin are a unique contribution to the literature. Possible explanations for these results and their implications for research and managerial practice are discussed.",0
A Comparison of Export Marketing Behavior of Canadian and Austrian High-Tech Firms,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"Export marketing behavior of high-tech companies in Canada and Austria is examined. T-test analysis was used to compare export marketing expertise, information sources, and market research, and the findings are discussed in the context of the competitive climate for high-tech products. Results show that Austrian companies are more culturally attuned than Canadian companies and that the latter are more inwardly focused. Each group appears to emphasize different areas of expertise and market research activities. Conclusions and implications for exporters of high-tech products and researchers are offered.",0
New Product Quality and Product Development Teams,Journal of Marketing,2000,"New product quality has been found to have a major influence on the market success and profitability of a new product. Firms are increasingly using cross-functional teams for product development in hopes of improving product quality, yet researchers know little about how such teams affect quality. The author proposes and tests a series of hypotheses regarding how new product quality is affected by team characteristics (functional diversity and information integration) and contextual influences (time pressure, product innovativeness from the firm's perspective, customers? influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm). The findings reveal that quality is positively related to information integration in the team, customers? influence on the product development process, and quality orientation in the firm. New product quality is negatively influenced by the innovativeness of the new product from the firm's perspective. However, information integration mitigates the negative effect of innovativeness on quality. Quality orientation weakens the relationship between information integration and quality. Time pressure and functional diversity do not have any effect on product quality.",0
"Stage-Gate Controls, Learning Failure, and Adverse Effect on Novel New Products",Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article argues that Stage-Gate controls have the potential of restricting learning in a new product development project and thus hurting the performance of novel new products. Specifically, the authors examine whether control on new product development exercised through rigorous gate review criteria increases project inflexibility, which in turn leads to increased failure to learn. They also focus on whether the effect of project inflexibility is worsened when there is turbulence in the firm's technological and market environment. Furthermore, the authors study whether failure to learn can have an adverse effect on new product performance when the product is novel. Finally, they examine whether a certain relaxation in gate evaluation (gate conditionality) that has been suggested recently mitigates the adverse effect of rigorously enforced controls. The results, which are based on a survey of 120 projects that used the Stage-Gate process for new product development, show that repeated application of strictly enforced and objective evaluation criteria for improved control makes projects more inflexible. Gate conditionality does not mitigate the adverse effect of gate review criteria. Project inflexibility leads to learning failure, and this effect is worsened when the technological environment of the firm is turbulent. In turn, learning failure adversely affects the market performance of novel new products.",0
Developing New-to-the-Firm Products: The Role of Micropolitical Strategies,Journal of Marketing,2012,"This research addresses three questions: (1) To what extent do new-to-the-firm products (with market and technology newness) face resistance in winning approval for development during the review process? (2) To what degree does product development teams? use of micropolitical strategies help reduce resistance and get approval with minimum compromise in the product? (3) To what extent do some of these micropolitical strategies harm the new product's performance? The findings suggest that products with both market and technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development. If the product development team wants to reduce resistance to products with market newness, it needs to build a coalition of supporters that can help it during the review process. Similarly, if the team seeks to minimize resistance to products with technology newness, it should frame the product in terms of the firms? existing products, strategies, and competitive thrusts. However, such framing increases resistance to market newness. If products continue to be resisted, they must be compromised (i.e., modified as a concession) to win approval. If the team wants to reduce the degree of compromise, it should initially develop the product in hiding. Products that are compromised perform poorly in the marketplace.",0
"Cross-Functional Product Development Teams, Creativity, and the Innovativeness of New Consumer Products",Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Multiple studies have found that the primary determinant of new product failure is an absence of innovativeness?the extent to which a new product provides meaningfully unique benefits. Given the persistence of this finding and the growing use of cross-functional teams in new product development projects, the authors examine how innovativeness is affected by various characteristics of cross-functional teams and contextual influences on the team. On the basis of a study of 141 cross-functional product development teams, the authors find that innovativeness is positively related to the strength of superordinate identity in the team, encouragement to take risk, customers' influence, and active monitoring of the project by senior management. Beyond a moderate level, social cohesion among team members has a negative effect on innovativeness. The effect of superordinate identity on innovativeness is strengthened by encouragement to take risk and weakened by social cohesion. Functional diversity has no effect on innovativeness. The authors discuss managerial and research implications of the findings.",1
The Asymmetric Share Effect: An Empirical Generalization on Cross-Price Effects,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Prior empirical literature states that asymmetry in cross-price effect favors the high-share brand. That is, when high-share brands discount, they have a greater impact on low-share brands than the reverse. This conclusion is based on consideration of cross-price elasticities. The authors point out that focusing on cross-price elasticities for assessing asymmetry is inappropriate for determining the incremental profitability from price promotions. Instead, asymmetries should be investigated in absolute cross-price effects, that is, change in market share of a competing brand for a unit price change of the focal brand. The authors theoretically and empirically demonstrate that asymmetry reverses when absolute cross-price effect is considered. That is, the absolute cross-price effect of a price reduction of a low-share brand on the market share or sales of a high-share brand is greater than the reverse. The authors discuss the implications of the findings and future research directions.",1
How Well Does Advertising Work? Generalizations from Meta-Analysis of Brand Advertising Elasticities,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 751 short-term and 402 long-term direct-to-consumer brand advertising elasticities estimated in 56 studies published between 1960 and 2008. The study finds several new empirical generalizations about advertising elasticity. The most important are as follows: the average short-term advertising elasticity is .12, which is substantially lower than the prior meta-analytic mean of .22; there has been a decline in the advertising elasticity over time; and advertising elasticity is higher (1) for durable goods than nondurable goods, (2) in the early stage than the mature stage of the life cycle, (3) for yearly data than quarterly data, and (4) when advertising is measured in gross rating points than monetary terms. The mean long-term advertising elasticity is .24, which is much lower than the implied mean in the prior meta-analysis (.41). many of the results for short-term elasticity hold for long-term elasticity, with some notable exceptions. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.",1
Format Neglect: How the Use of Numerical Versus Percentage Rank Claims Influences Consumer Judgments,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Marketers often claim to be part of an exclusive tier (e.g., ?top 10?) within their competitive set. Although recent behavioral research has investigated how consumers respond to rank claims, prior work has focused exclusively on claims having a numerical format. But marketers often communicate rankings using percentages (e.g., ?top 20%?). The present research explores how using a numerical format claim (e.g., ?top 10? out of 50 products) versus an equivalent percentage format claim (e.g., ?top 20%? out of 50 products) influences consumer judgments. Across five experiments, the authors find robust evidence of a shift in evaluations whereby consumers respond more favorably to numerical rank claims when set sizes are smaller (i.e., <100) but more favorably to percentage rank claims when set sizes are larger (i.e., >100), even when the claims are mathematically equivalent. They further show that this change in evaluations occurs because consumers commit format neglect when making their evaluations by relying predominantly on the nominal value conveyed in a rank claim and insufficiently accounting for set size.",0
"The Completeness Heuristic: Product Shape Completeness Influences Size Perceptions, Preference, and Consumption",Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"This research demonstrates the effect of the completeness of a product's shape on size perceptions, preference, and consumption quantities. The authors show that people estimate an incompletely shaped product to be smaller and, therefore, prefer it less in general than a completely shaped one of equal size and weight. They also find that the reduced size estimations for incompletely shaped products lead to increased consumption quantities of this type of item. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the ?completeness heuristic? operates even when the incompletely shaped item has a larger primary dimension than its completely shaped counterpart.",1
Leaving Something for the Imagination: The Effect of Visual Concealment on Preferences,Journal of Marketing,2020,"When advertising products to consumers, firms sometimes conceal key aspects in an effort to arouse consumer curiosity. This research investigates when and how visual concealment tactics may benefit or hurt aesthetic product evaluations. The authors propose that when consumers are only able to view a portion of an aesthetic product, assessments of its appeal will be influenced by two interrelated mechanisms: curiosity to see the item completed and inferences about the item?s fully disclosed appearance. The authors show that heightened curiosity triggers feelings of positive affect that are transferred to the product itself, a process that may inflate preferences and choice likelihoods for products beyond what would occur if the full image were known. This transference effect, however, has an important boundary: it works only when initial consumer inferences about the appeal of the product are positive or emotionally congruent with the positive affect triggered by curiosity. The key implication is that, ironically, the products likely to benefit most from concealment tactics are those that have the least to hide. The authors provide evidence for these effects and the underlying mechanism using six experiments that manipulate concealment in a variety of task settings.",0
Limited Availability Reduces the Rate of Satiation,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"In general, consumers enjoy products less with repeated consumption. Unfortunately, there are few known ways to slow such satiation. The authors show that consumers satiate more slowly on a product when it is available for consumption only at limited times. Specifically, they find that perceived limited availability made a product more enjoyable, and yet this effect largely emerged only after repeated consumption. The authors attribute this finding to an urge to take advantage of a rare consumption opportunity, which leads people to pay less attention to the quantity consumed and subsequently to experience less satiation. A series of studies establish the effect of perceived limited availability on the rate of satiation, show that it influences how much people eat, provide mediation evidence of the proposed theoretical account, and eliminate the effect by making salient the total amount consumed. The authors conclude with implications of these findings.",1
"The Space-to-Product Ratio Effect: How Interstitial Space Influences Product Aesthetic Appeal, Store Perceptions, and Product Preference",Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors identify and examine the effect of space-to-product ratio on consumer response; very generally, consumers perceive products as more valuable when more space is devoted to their display. In both lab and field studies, the authors find that this phenomenon influences total sales, purchase likelihood, and even perceived product experience (taste perceptions). More interstitial space increases perceptions of individual products as more aesthetically pleasing and the store as more prestigious. The authors find these effects across a variety of product categories and rule out a number of competing alternative explanations that are based on perceptions of product popularity, scarcity, assortment search difficulty, and messiness.",1
Anticipation of Future Variety Reduces Satiation from Current Experiences,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Satiation frequently occurs from repeated consumption of the same items over time. However, results from five experiments show that when people anticipate consuming something different in the future, they satiate at a slower rate in the present. The authors find the effect in both food and nonfood consumption settings using different approaches to measure satiation. This effect is cognitive; specifically, anticipating variety in future consumption generates positive thoughts about that future experience. The authors find two boundary conditions: the future consumption outcome must be (1) in a related product category and (2) at least as attractive as the present consumption outcome. The authors rule out potential alternative explanations such as mere exposure to variety, the possibility that the future experience is more attractive (rather than just different) than the current one, and perceptions of scarcity associated with the item consumed in the present.",1
The Political Participation Puzzle and Marketing,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This study shows that one of the most intriguing findings on political participation?that the participation rate is higher in close elections?is due to the omission of variables, namely, the marketing activities. This relationship between closeness and participation is intriguing because (1) it implies that people participate in elections because their vote might be decisive, but (2) such an incentive to vote is unreasonable. This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996?2004 presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the author finds that the data support the model and its implications. Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic. For example, if the marketing activity were canceled in the 2004 elections, the number of voters would have decreased by 15 million.",1
"Cast Demographics, Unobserved Segments, and Heterogeneous Switching Costs in a Television Viewing Choice Model",Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"An accurate television viewing choice model is an important tool for television executives and advertisers. The authors present a new viewing choice model, which differs from the traditional Rust-Alpert model in three ways: (1) It introduces a new show characteristic?the demographic characteristics of a show's cast; (2) it allows the preferences over the traditional show categories to be a function of both observable and unobservable individual characteristics; and (3) it allows the cost of switching among the viewing alternatives to vary across show types and individual characteristics. Cross-validated predictive testing shows that this model fits the data better than the Rust?Alpert model does. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that network executives can improve ratings by using this model. The authors predict that by following their scheduling strategies (in particular, by broadcasting comedies after 10:00 P.M.), ABC, CBS, and NBC could have increased their average ratings by 12.9%, 7.5%, and 6.7%, respectively, on selected evenings.",1
Seller Beware: How Bundling Affects Valuation,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"How does bundling affect valuation? This research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus, consumers resist altering the ?whole? of the bundle by removing or adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis)satisfaction (Study 3). Moreover, bundle composition?the ability of different items to create the impression of a ?whole??moderates the effect of bundling on valuation (Study 4), and the need to replace missing items (i.e., restoring the ?whole?) mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study 6).",1
Price Promotions Cause Impatience,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In this research, the authors propose that incidental exposure to price promotions can cause downstream impatience in an unrelated domain. Specifically, price promotions trigger reward seeking?a general motivational state?and reward seeking, in turn, yields impatience. Seven experiments (N = 1,795) demonstrate how incidental exposure to price promotions can cause greater willingness to pay to avoid waiting (Experiments 1a and 1b), shorter actual wait times (Experiments 2, 3b, and 5), greater propensity to break a rule to save time (Experiment 3a), and greater discounting in a consequential intertemporal choice (Experiment 4). Consistent with this account, the effect is both more pronounced for people with greater reward sensitivity (Experiments 3a and 3b) and mediated by reward seeking (Experiment 4). Finally, a conceptual replication in a field setting underscores the external validity and managerial relevance of the findings (Experiment 5).",1
Internationalizing-Innovation Profiles and High-Technology Exports: Does Lone Genius Matter?,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Innovation-performance research, when conducted at the firm level, neglects the role of innovation that is created without firm involvement. In this article, the authors test Schumpeter's lone-genius hypothesis: ?Change in economic life always starts with the actions of a forceful individual.? To do so, the authors introduce country-level internationalizing-innovation profile (IIP), which characterizes a country's innovation resources, and internationalizing-innovation experience (IIE), which characterizes a country's level of patenting activity into the United States. Using fixed-effects panel data analysis for 50 countries from 1990 through 2010, the authors demonstrate that a country's IIP moderated by IIE influences high-technology exports. The findings suggest that lone genius does have an impact, depending on the phase of a country's IIE development. The implications of these findings for theory, public policy, and international marketing managers are discussed.",0
Surcharges plus Unhealthy Labels Reduce Demand for Unhealthy Menu Items,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Three laboratory experiments and a field experiment in a restaurant demonstrate that neither a price surcharge nor an unhealthy label is enough on its own to curtail the demand for unhealthy food. However, when the two are combined as an unhealthy label surcharge, they reduce demand for unhealthy food. The authors also show that the unhealthy label is as effective for women as the unhealthy label surcharge, whereas it backfires for men, who order more unhealthy food when there is an unhealthy label alone. The authors demonstrate that an unhealthy surcharge, which highlights both the financial disincentive and potential health costs, can significantly drive healthier consumption choices. From a policy and government perspective, if the goal is to reduce demand for unhealthy food, increasing the transparency of the health rationale for any financial disincentive is necessary to effectively lower unhealthy food consumption.",1
Managing Customer Profits: The Power of Habits,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Do customers exhibit recurring behaviors beyond repeat purchases? If so, what are those behaviors, how are they formed, and why should marketers care? The authors apply the theory of habit to customer behavior in the context of a large customer data set of a national retailer. They find that (1) beyond repeat purchases, customers' recurring behavior with respect to returning products, purchasing on promotion, and purchasing low-margin items can be quantified along a continuum of habit strength; (2) marketing has a temporal impact on the formation of different customers' habits; and (3) customers' purchase and promotion habits positively affect firm performance (by $58 million), whereas return and low-margin purchase habits negatively affect firm performance (by $62 million). The findings underscore the need for managers to consider customer habits beyond repeat purchases, take stock of customers' habit measures before implementing policy changes, and leverage the habit measures (as compared with using only traditional behavioral measures) to strategically allocate resources at the customer level to maximize customer and firm profits.",1
Linking Customer Behaviors to Cash Flow Level and Volatility: Implications for Marketing Practices,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Marketing affects customer behavior, and customer behavior in turn drives a firm's cash flows and, ultimately, valuation. In this sequence of relationships, a commonly overlooked factor by marketers is the volatility of customers' cash flows. This study links different recurring customer behaviors to the future level and volatility of a customer's cash flows. Empirical analyses of the large customer database of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash flow volatility and $39.42 million increase in the future cash flow level of the firm. Furthermore, firm-initiated marketing is 1.9?3.2 times more effective at managing the future cash flow level and volatility when it is selectively targeted to customers with certain characteristics. Overall, the study enables marketers to manage different customer behaviors that influence customers' future cash flow level and volatility and ultimately quantify the impact of these behaviors on the shareholder value of the firm.",1
Unprofitable Cross-Buying: Evidence from Consumer and Business Markets,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Conventional wisdom, marketing literature, and cross-selling practices to date are based on the notion that customer cross-buying is positively associated with customer profitability. However, this study finds that when certain customers with persistent adverse behavioral traits (e.g., limited spending, excessive revenue reversals, excessive service requests, promotion purchase behavior) engage in cross-buying, they exhibit a downward spiral of unprofitable relationship, with the losses increasing with higher levels of cross-buy. The authors analyze the customer databases of five firms and find that 10%?35% of the firms' customers who cross-buy are unprofitable and account for a significant proportion (39%?88%) of the firms' total loss from its customers. Consequently, the authors present a two-stage framework to enable managers to discern customers who are likely to engage in profitable versus unprofitable cross-buying. Overall, the findings refine the basic understanding of the cross-buy phenomenon and motivate managers to rethink their marketing practices and policies, which are typically designed to maximize cross-buy opportunities for every customer.",0
Diagnosing Brand Performance: Accounting for the Dynamic Impact of Product Availability with Aggregate Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The extent to which a brand's individual products (relative to competing products) are available to consumers for purchase in a retail store can critically affect the brand's overall performance. However, store-level product availability information is lost in aggregate market-level data sets and has been ignored by extant demand studies in general, which can create the risk of misinformed managerial decision making. In this research, the authors propose a unique methodology to enable manufacturers to infer retailers? joint stocking probability of products from aggregate data and, thus, enable consumers? choices to be contingent on the assortment of products available in retail stores. The application of the proposed framework in the context of an emerging market results in unbiased demand parameter estimates, a significantly better model fit, and richer managerial insights (compared with conventional approaches) pertaining to how brand performance is affected by the (1) dynamics of retailers? stocking preferences, (2) assortment of products that retailers are more (vs. less) likely to jointly stock, and (3) cannibalization of retailers? shelf space resulting from product line extensions.",1
Revisiting Location in a Digital Age: How Can Lead Markets Accelerate the Internationalization of Mobile Apps?,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Firms strategically expand to countries that offer important location advantages. Yet, for digital firms, which can instantly release their technologies worldwide, it is unclear whether a focus on specific locations can still provide strategic advantages. The authors argue that digital firms reap critical demand-side location advantages for the internationalization of their technologies by strategically interacting with users in lead markets that exhibit either high within-country demand heterogeneity or preference overlaps with several other countries. Simply penetrating a lead market is not enough, however, as both demand-side and supply-side factors influence the digital firm?s potential to take advantage of lead markets. On the demand side, a digital firm should avoid focusing on paying users or acquiring light users. On the supply side, the digital firm must deploy adequate technological and marketing capabilities to benefit from user interactions in lead markets. Thus, the authors link demand-side opportunities and supply-side firm capabilities to develop nuanced theory on how digital firms can spur international expansion. They find empirical support for their arguments by analyzing a large multicounty database of mobile apps in Apple?s App Store.",0
Identity Congruency Effects on Donations,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"This article describes several field and laboratory experiments that investigate an identity congruency effect on donations. Experiment 1 is a field experiment showing that consumers give more money to a public radio station if they are told that a previous donor who shares their identity also made a large contribution. This effect is more likely to occur when consumers have high collective-identity esteem (measured in Experiment 2a) and when attention is focused on others (manipulated in Experiment 2b). The authors measure these two moderators simultaneously and observe and replicate a three-way interaction. Again, the identity congruency effect is the strongest when consumers have high collective-identity esteem and when attention is focused on others (Experiment 3a and Experiment 3b). These results provide a novel understanding of the causes of the identity congruency effect on donations. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and substantive implications of these findings.",1
Marketplace Donations: The Role of Moral Identity Discrepancy and Gender,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"A demonstration field experiment in a live-radio fund drive shows that women (but not men) primed with moral traits give about 20% more. The authors test one understudied explanation for this finding: gender differences in how market behavior (e.g., giving and supporting a nonprofit) shrinks moral identity discrepancy (i.e., the gap between actual and ideal moral identity). Field Survey 1 demonstrates the basic effect: the less money women (but not men) have historically given on average to a nonprofit, the larger their moral identity discrepancy. Field Experiment 2 shows a managerial implication of this basic effect: when primed with moral identity, women (but not men) who have supported the nonprofit less frequently in the past are more likely to follow an emailed link to help the nonprofit again. Study 3 tests one possible pathway underpinning this finding: even though giving makes women and men experience similar feelings of encouragement and uplift and similar reinforcement of their moral identity, only women with larger prebehavior moral identity discrepancy consequently shrink this discrepancy.",1
Distribution Network Redesign for Marketing Competitiveness,Journal of Marketing,2009,"This article reports on a marketing initiative at a pharmaceutical company to redesign its distribution network. Distribution affects a firm's cost and customer satisfaction and drives profitability. Using a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model, the authors develop a distribution network with a dual emphasis on minimizing the total distribution costs and improving the customer service levels. Specifically, they address the following issues: They (1) determine the optimal number of regional distribution centers the firm should operate with, (2) identify where in the United States the firm should locate these distribution centers, (3) allocate each retailer/customer distribution center to an appropriate regional distribution center, and (4) determine the total transportation costs and service level for each case. Finally, they conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in problem parameters on the optimality of the proposed model. This marketing initiative at the studied firm reduced the total distribution costs by $1.99 million (6%) per year, while increasing the customer on-time delivery from 61.41% to 86.2%, an improvement of 40.4%.",0
The Benefits of Emergency Reserves: Greater Preference and Persistence for Goals that Have Slack with a Cost,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Marketers of programs that are designed to help consumers reach goals face dual challenges of making the program attractive enough to encourage consumer signup while still motivating consumers to reach desirable goals and thus stay satisfied with the program. The authors offer a possible solution to this challenge: the emergency reserve, or slack with a cost. They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher attainability and value than other goals. Study 4 demonstrates that reserves can lead to increased goal persistence in a realistic task that involves persistence over time. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 reveal that consumers persist more with reserve goals because they want to avoid using the ?emergency? reserve.",1
Ritualization: A Strategic Tool to Position Brands in International Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Most brands today attempt to develop a self-brand connection with their customers. Multiple studies have proposed that a brand can achieve a sacred status through ?rituals.? However, there is limited understanding of the mechanism through which rituals and customers? ritualized behavior influence brand awareness. As firms in international markets face intense competition from local brands, understanding the impact of customers? ritualization can help them enhance brand awareness. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide theoretical understanding on the relationship between rituals and brand awareness for firms operating in international markets. Specifically, they propose that internal ritualization leads to brand recall and external ritualization leads to brand recognition. As customer-firm relationship can be affected by market, firm, and customer-specific factors, the authors argue that cultural orientation, competition, firms? marketing spend, and customers? personality moderate the proposed relationships. They provide several research propositions to help understand rituals as a strategic tool. The findings of this study indicate that managers must incorporate customers? ritualized behavior when developing global branding strategies in international markets.",0
Modeling Emerging-Market Firms? Competitive Retail Distribution Strategies,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"In emerging markets, the effective implementation of distribution strategies is challenged by underdeveloped road infrastructure and a low penetration of retail stores that are insufficient in meeting customer needs. In addition, products are typically distributed in multiple forms through multiple retail channels. Given the competitive landscape, manufacturers? distribution strategies should be based on anticipation of competitor reactions. Accordingly, the authors develop a manufacturer-level competition model to study the distribution and price decisions of insecticide manufacturers competing across multiple product forms and retail channels. Their study shows that both consumer preferences and estimated production and distribution costs vary across brands, product forms, and retail channels; that ignoring distribution and solely focusing on price competition results in up to a 55% overestimation of manufacturer profit margins; and that observed pricing and distribution patterns support competition rather than collusion among manufacturers. Through counterfactual studies, the authors find that manufacturers respond to decreases in distribution costs and to the exclusive distribution of more preferred manufacturers by asymmetrically changing their price and distribution decisions across different retail channels.",1
Investigating the Influence of Characteristics of the New Product Introduction Process on Firm Value: The Case of the Pharmaceutical Industry,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Scholars identify several benefits of new product introductions (NPI), yet prior literature largely overlooks how the process of NPI generates marketplace insights and influences subsequent products. Building on the concept of absorptive capacity, the authors argue that the influence of products on firm value depends on process characteristics, namely, the pace, irregularity, and scope of NPI. Using data collected from multiple sources for products introduced by pharmaceutical firms between 1991 and 2015 and robust econometric methods that account for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, this study reveals that pace and scope have an inverted U-shaped effect on firm value, whereas irregularity negatively influences firm value. Moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of NPI with firm value. This research documents the importance of adopting a portfolio approach to the sequential introduction of new products and incorporating insights gained from previous product introductions; it cautions managers against evaluating products in isolation. The authors discuss the economic significance of these results and provide actionable guidance for managers.",0
The Commitment Mix: Dimensions of Commitment in International Trading Relationships in India,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The authors identify five types of relationship commitment in international marketing relationships: value-based, affective, locked-in, obligation, and behavioral commitment. They develop and test scales to measure these dimensions on the basis of a study of India-based firms? international business relationships. The dimensions are interrelated but distinct and vary according to relationship development, performance, and cultural context. The authors find similar patterns of commitment for better-performing relationships with partners in different regions of the world, but there are differences by region for poorer-performing relationships. The results have implications for developing and sustaining successful international marketing relationships and for further research.",0
Cultural Orientation and Brand Dilution: Impact of Motivation Level and Extension Typicality,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research examines cross-cultural differences in brand dilution effects and the moderating role of motivation and extension typicality. Drawing from recent findings that indicate that culture affects the way people treat conflicting information, this research predicts that Easterners and Westerners react differently to failures by a brand extension. In contrast to previous findings that have suggested that failure in a typical extension leads to less brand dilution for Westerners when they are highly motivated (than when they are less motivated), this study argues that Easterners exhibit greater brand dilution when they are less motivated (than when they are highly motivated). The opposite pattern of results should emerge when the extension is atypical. Three studies provide support for these predictions and the underlying processes.",1
Free Shipping Promotions and Product Returns,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Free shipping promotions have become popular among online retailers. However, little is known about their influence on consumers? purchases, return behavior, and, ultimately, firm profit. The authors propose that free shipping promotions encourage customers to make riskier purchases, leading to more product returns. They estimate the impact of these promotions on purchase incidence, high-risk and low-risk spend, and return share. The results show that free shipping promotions increase expenditure for high-risk products, expanding their share of the consumer?s market basket and thus increasing the overall return rate. This is validated in a field experiment. A field test and an online lab experiment analyze the mechanism linking free shipping and returns. The results suggest that the free shipping effect occurs through consumers? perceptions that free shipping serves as a risk premium compensating them for potential returns and through positive affect generated by the promotion. A simulation shows that for the focal firm, free shipping promotions increase net sales volume, but higher product returns and lost shipping revenue render these promotions unprofitable.",1
Computer Interfaces and the ?Direct-Touch? Effect: Can iPads Increase the Choice of Hedonic Food?,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"People are able to order food using a variety of computer devices, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. Even in restaurants, patrons can place orders on computer screens. Can the interface that consumers use affect their choice of food? The authors focus on the ?direct-touch? aspect of touch interfaces, whereby users can touch the screen in an interactive manner. In a series of five studies, they show that a touch interface, such as that provided by an iPad, compared with a nontouch interface, such as that of a desktop computer with a mouse, facilitates the choice of an affect-laden alternative over a cognitively superior one?what the authors call the ?direct-touch effect.? The studies provide some mediational support that the direct-touch effect is driven by the enhanced mental simulation of product interaction with the more affective choice alternative on touch interfaces. The authors also test the moderator of this effect. Using multiple product pairs as stimuli, the authors obtain consistent results, which have rich theoretical and managerial implications.",1
The Synergetic Effect of Multinational Corporation Management's Social Cognitive Capability on Tacit-Knowledge Management: Product Innovation Ability Insights from Asia,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Multinational corporations (MNCs) use their overseas subsidiaries to access tacit knowledge about host countries. It is generally assumed that subsidiary tacit knowledge contributes directly to greater product innovativeness; however, little empirical evidence supports this assumption. In this research, the authors propose a negative direct relationship between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs? product innovation ability. The authors then examine the role of social cognitive capability as an attenuator of this negative relationship between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs? product innovation ability. The results reveal that each of the MNCs? social cognitive capability components (i.e., task efficacy, organic structure, and affective trust) independently weakens this negative relationship. Moreover, combining social cognitive capabilities exerts synergetic influences to further excavate the effect of tacit knowledge.",0
The Effects of Business and Political Ties on Firm Performance: Evidence from China,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Despite increasing attention to the role of social ties in emerging economies, few studies have explicitly distinguished the differential roles of business versus political ties. Drawing on relational governance and institutional theories, this study offers a contingent view of business and political ties in China. The findings from a survey of 241 Chinese firms indicate that business ties have a stronger positive effect on performance than political ties, and both effects depend on institutional and market environments. Business ties are more beneficial when legal enforcement is inefficient and technology is changing rapidly, whereas political ties lead to greater performance when general government support is weak and technological turbulence is low. These findings indicate that firms operating in China should be cautious in their use of business and political ties and adapt their tie utilization to changing institutional and market environments.",0
Impact of Emerging Markets on Marketing: Rethinking Existing Perspectives and Practices,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The core idea of this article is that five key characteristics?market heterogeneity, sociopolitical governance, chronic shortage of resources, unbranded competition, and inadequate infrastructure?of emerging markets are radically different from the traditional industrialized capitalist society, and they will require us to rethink the core assumptions of marketing, such as market orientation, market segmentation, and differential advantage. To accommodate these characteristics, we must rethink the marketing perspective (e.g., from differential advantage to market aggregation and standardization) and the core guiding strategy concepts (e.g., from market orientation to market development). Similarly, we must rethink issues of public policy (e.g., from compliance and crisis driven to purpose driven) and the marketing practice (e.g., from glocalization to fusion marketing).",0
Borderless Media: Rethinking International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"This article focuses on the impact of digital platforms on international marketing. It describes the evolution of social media and its influence on marketing. After identifying a typology of context for international marketing, the author identifies and describes five dimensions of value creation in marketing: access, affordability, acceptance, awareness, and activation. Finally, this article provides future implications for areas of research in social media and international marketing.",0
EXPRESS: Organizational Herding in Advertising Spending Disclosures: Evidence and Mechanisms,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"As firms use advertising to gain product market advantages and increase their valuation in financial markets, disclosing their advertising spending is influential?whether it erodes organizational competitive advantages in product markets or signals quality in financial markets. The authors argue that firms learn from peers? decisions to reduce the uncertainty in their own advertising disclosure, and they empirically investigate information-based organizational herding in the context of advertising spending disclosure, where a 1994 reporting rule made advertising spending disclosures voluntary in the United States. The authors examine whether a firm relies on information from benchmark leaders or similar peers to resolve disclosure uncertainty. A novel identification strategy, which uses partially overlapping strategic groups, to mitigate simultaneity and correlated unobservables, shows robust evidence for herding effects among peer firms in the same strategic group. Moreover, firms are more likely to resolve disclosure uncertainty from similar peers rather than from benchmark leaders. The authors discuss how firms can use knowledge of competitors? predicted advertising disclosure decisions conditional on their disclosure to their strategic advantage in product and financial markets.",1
Sales Representative Departures and Customer Reassignment Strategies in Business-to-Business Markets,Journal of Marketing,2017,"When a sales representative (rep) leaves a business-to-business firm, a crucial link with the rep's customers becomes severed. The firm reassigns those customers to different sales reps (either existing reps or new hires) in a manner that mitigates potential sales losses. What causal effect do sales rep departures have on customer-level revenue, and which sales rep replacement strategies are more effective? Using data from a Fortune 500 firm and a difference-in-differences analysis with correction for selection bias, the authors show that sales rep transitions lead to 13.2%?17.6% losses in annual sales. New hires are less effective than existing sales reps in mitigating sales losses. Existing sales reps who are similar (vs. dissimilar) to the departing reps (in terms of past industry experience) are more effective in mitigating sales losses; however, reps with high past performance do not exhibit greater efficacy for mitigating sales losses than reps with average or low past performance. The analysis presents means to quantify the economic consequences of losing a sales rep and to determine how to reassign customers to sales reps according to the resulting economic impact.",0
Performance Effects of Global Account Coordination Mechanisms: An Integrative Study of Boundary Conditions,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Although many multinational companies have instituted global account management (GAM) programs to coordinate selling activities to better serve and retain their key global customers, evidence of the effectiveness of their GAM coordination efforts is elusive. Viewing GAM coordination as an organizational design issue in managing vertical procurement relationships, the authors draw on global marketing strategy, organizational design, and relationship marketing theories to study how the performances of GAM coordination mechanisms vary with a host of strategic, relational, and environmental conditions. The conceptual model is tested using data collected from a cross-national sample of more than 200 global account managers. The results show that although GAM relational coordination and GAM operational coordination both have positive effects on GAM performance, they do not perform uniformly well under various boundary conditions. In other words, the performance of a GAM coordination mechanism depends on its fit with the operating context.",0
Executive Insights: Global Account Management Capability: Insights from Leading Suppliers,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Global account management (GAM) has become a strategic focus among most multinational companies, but there is little empirical research on what type of organizational capability fosters GAM programs. In this article, the authors synthesize selected literature on the topic, examine relevant fieldwork and case studies, and discuss findings from in-depth field interviews with leading global suppliers that have active GAM programs in place. This research clarifies constructs, develops research propositions, and provides an integrated framework that includes GAM processes and performance consequences.",0
Beyond Adoption: Development and Application of a Use-Diffusion Model,Journal of Marketing,2004,"The study tests a use-diffusion model in the context of home technology use. The authors combine two constructs, variety and rate of use, to yield four user segments. The results show that user segments vary on the basis of social context and technological makeup of the household as well as personal factors and external influences. Furthermore, user segments differ with regard to users? satisfaction with technology and interest in acquiring future technologies.",0
The Role of Selling Costs in Signaling Price Image,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"To attract potential customers, retailers often advertise low prices with appeals such as ?Prices start at $49? or ?One week in the Caribbean from $449.? These appeals are deliberately vague in the sense that they give little information about the product to which the prices refer. The author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image even with this vagueness. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use such a strategy. The author shows analytically that such advertising can be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers' costs or when the selling cost is high.",1
Brand Synergy Effects in Multiple Brand Extensions,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Three experiments demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of two brand extensions can have a positive influence on their evaluations independently of parent?extension similarity. This ?synergy? effect occurs when the extensions are complementary (e.g., a digital camera and a digital photo printer) but is not evident when they belong to the same category (two models of digital cameras) or to unrelated categories (a digital camera and a snowboard). In addition, the effect is restricted to extension products that are introduced by the same manufacturer. Finally, it occurs only among participants who are promotion focused and therefore are disposed to consider the benefits of owning the extensions rather than the disadvantages of doing so. These and other results suggest that the synergy effect is due to the appeal of completing a set of related products from the same manufacturer rather than the physical or functional similarity of their features to those of either the parent or each other.",1
Ruminating about Placebo Effects of Marketing Actions,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"In Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely (2005), the authors demonstrate that marketing actions such as price promotions and advertising evoke consumer expectations, which can alter the actual efficacy of the marketed product, a phenomenon they call ?placebo effects of marketing actions.? In this rejoinder, they build on the preceding commentaries and refine their framework to account more fully for factors that may influence this placebo effect, and they describe directions for further research in this new topic area.",1
Placebo Effects of Marketing Actions: Consumers May Get What They Pay For,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors demonstrate that marketing actions, such as pricing, can alter the actual efficacy of products to which they are applied. These placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies about the efficacy of the product, a process that appears not to be conscious. In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications of the findings.",1
Product Complements and Substitutes in the Real World: The Relevance of ?Other Products?,Journal of Marketing,2004,"In the real world, buyer demand for a product can depend directly and indirectly on the marketing efforts of ?other products? in different categories. The authors offer a behavioral rationale for the existence of the effects of ?other products'? marketing efforts and propose a taxonomy of possible intercategory relationships. The discussion enables the authors to identify several promising new research directions.",0
Export Performance: A Conceptualization and Empirical Assessment,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Export performance has been a central construct in the study of export marketing. Several studies have attempted to identify organizational and managerial antecedents of export performance and assess the relative importance of these antecedents. However, despite these fruitful efforts, there is little agreement in the literature about a conceptual definition of export performance, as well as about its operational definition. This article follows up on two previous articles that dealt with export performance conceptually (Madsen 1987; Shoham 1991) and uses a similar, three-dimensional conceptualization of export performance. This conceptualization is explored empirically with data from 93 Israeli exporters. The data indicate that there are indeed three dimensions to export performance, though the structure of these dimensions is somewhat different from expectations.",0
"Bounded Rationality, Planning, Standardization of International Strategy, and Export Performance: A Structural Model Examination",Journal of International Marketing,1999,"This article examines a comprehensive list of environmental conditions that affect the decision to standardize, as well as the relationship of strategy standardization and planning with static (present year) and change over time (five years) export performance. Determinants of standardization include country image, competitors? similarity, competitive position similarity, physical market environment, legal environment, governmental influences, and media similarity, and standardization of strategy determines export performance. Research hypotheses are tested by data generated from a mail survey in Israel, and the findings are used to generate research and managerial implications.",0
Reducing the Impact of Barriers to Exporting: A Managerial Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"Most prior research on barriers to exporting has been descriptive. The perceived importance to firms of numerous barriers has been documented in various countries and regions. Perceptions of barriers are important because they influence managerial behavior in international markets. Surprisingly, researchers have mostly ignored the firm and decision making characteristics that give rise to barriers. Why do some firms perceive barriers to be more important than other firms? Or, why do some firms perceive a given barrier as more important than it is for another company? The research reported here examines the role of cultural distance and managerial decision-making style as explanatory variables. The data indicate that both play a role in predicting the perceived importance of export barriers to exporters.",0
International Standardization of Channel Management and Its Behavioral and Performance Outcomes,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Most research on standardization examines it in the context of the marketing mix. In contrast, research on standardization of management processes/characteristics is rare. The authors examine standardization of such processes/characteristics in international management of channels of distribution and its performance consequences. They include characteristics of firms? relationships with their foreign representatives (coordination, support, autonomy, communications, and control) and their impact on behavioral and performance outcomes. Data generated from a survey in Slovenia mostly support the research hypotheses.",0
Animosity on the Home Front: The Intifada in Israel and Its Impact on Consumer Behavior,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"International animosity significantly affects the purchase of foreign products. However, domestic conflicts are also rampant in many countries, giving rise to similar issues. October 2000 marked the beginning of the second Arab Intifada (uprising) in Israel. In contrast to the first Intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s, this time, Israeli Arabs joined the Palestinians in violent demonstrations in Israeli locations with large Arab concentrations. This research studies Jewish Israelis? reactions to Arab Israelis in the context of purchases and consumption of products and services produced or marketed by Arab Israelis. It examines animosity, its antecedents, and its consumption consequences within the large Jewish majority of the population in Israel. The authors find that dogmatism, nationalism, and internationalism affect animosity, which in turn predicts willingness to buy and actual changes in purchase behavior for goods and services produced or marketed by Israeli Arabs. In contrast to previous research, animosity also predicts product judgments.",0
A Contingent View of Partner Coopetition in International Joint Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Is coopetition between foreign and local partners good or bad for international joint venture (IJV) performance? This study develops a contingent view to examine how the efficacy of coopetition is conditional on IJV characteristics (i.e., foreign equity share and partner cultural compatibility) and environmental factors (i.e., technological turbulence and market growth). The results from analyzing 194 IJVs in China reveal that coopetition fosters IJV performance under the conditions of high foreign equity share, low partner cultural compatibility, high technological turbulence, and/or high market growth. In contrast, coopetition hinders IJV performance at low levels of foreign equity share, technological turbulence, and/or market growth, or at high levels of partner cultural compatibility. These findings support the authors? contingent view of coopetition and provide novel insights for managing partner coopetition in IJVs.",0
When Three Charms but Four Alarms: Identifying the Optimal Number of Claims in Persuasion Settings,Journal of Marketing,2014,"How many positive claims should firms use to produce the most positive impression of a product or service? This article posits that when consumers know that the message source has a persuasion motive, the optimal number of positive claims is three. Increasing the number of claims improves consumer perceptions until the fourth claim, at which point consumers? persuasion knowledge causes them to view all the claims with skepticism. The studies herein establish and explore this pattern, which the authors refer to as the ?charm of three.? An initial experiment indicates that impressions peak at three claims for sources with a persuasion motive but not for sources without a persuasion motive. The second experiment indicates that this effect occurs for attitudes and impressions and that increased skepticism at four or more claims explains the effect. Two final experiments examine the mental process by which the charm of three occurs by investigating how cognitive load and sequential claims influence the effect.",0
Procrastination of Enjoyable Experiences,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The tendency to procrastinate applies not only to aversive tasks but also to positive experiences with immediate benefits. The authors propose that models of time discounting can explain this behavior, and they test these predictions with field data and experiments. A multicity study shows that people with unlimited time windows delay visiting desirable landmarks; however, procrastination is reduced when the window of opportunity is constrained. Similarly, people procrastinate in redeeming gift certificates and gift cards with long deadlines more than those with short deadlines, resulting in overall lower redemption rates. These results run counter to participants? predictions and typical models of impulsive behavior.",1
Consumer Preferences for Annuity Attributes: Beyond Net Present Value,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Decisions about life annuities are an important part of consumer decumulation of retirement assets, yet they are relatively underexplored by marketing researchers studying consumer financial decision making. In this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.",1
"Revisiting Consumer Ethnocentrism: Review, Reconceptualization, and Empirical Testing",Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Prior research has suggested that many consumers prefer domestic to foreign products, even when the quality is lower and the price is higher. Such bias is attributed to consumer ethnocentrism. This study critically examines the current conceptualizations of consumer ethnocentrism and proposes an extension of its conceptual boundaries and measurement. It determines that consumer ethnocentrism is a multidimensional construct that encompasses five dimensions: prosociality, cognition, insecurity, reflexiveness, and habituation. Empirical evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States demonstrates that the extended measurement instrument better predicts consumers? preferences for local brands at the expense of foreign brands.",0
Exporting Services Successfully: Antecedents and Performance Implications of Customer Relationships,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"This research is among the first to present a study of the drivers of service export performance. The authors develop and empirically test a theoretical framework of the antecedent and performance implications of cross-border customer relationships (CCRs) in the context of service exports. Survey data from 142 business-to-business service providers show that valuable CCRs have positive impacts on the export performance of services, but there is no influence derived from the number of cross-border relationships. The results also indicate a positive link between relationship marketing activities and the cross-cultural skills of service employees on the one side with valuable and numerous CCRs on the other. That is, relationship marketing activities receive positive influences from export commitment, customer orientation, and managers? cross-cultural skills.",0
Service Quality and Export Performance of Business-to-Business Service Providers: The Role of Service Employee? and Customer-Oriented Quality Control Initiatives,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Using the facilities?transformation?usage framework of service provision and drawing from control theory, the authors develop a theoretical model that examines the influence of different quality control initiatives on relative service quality in a business-to-business setting and, consequently, on export performance. They explicitly consider quality control initiatives that address service employees? performance and the customers? coproduction as well as selected firm characteristics as antecedents of such initiatives. They test the proposed model on data drawn from an export survey of service providers. The results show that export customer?oriented training, customer coproduction instructions, and work process standardization have a positive influence on relative service quality, which in turn positively affects export performance. However, adaptation to export customers? coproduction competence and motivation has a positive influence on relative service quality only when the customer integration in the service delivery is high. The authors conclude by considering implications for the management of the service delivery process in an export setting and identifying future research directions.",0
Customer Experience Journeys: Loyalty Loops Versus Involvement Spirals,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Customer experience management research is increasingly concerned with the long-term evolution of customer experience journeys across multiple service cycles. A dominant smooth journey model makes customers? lives easier, with a cyclical pattern of predictable experiences that builds customer loyalty over time, also known as a loyalty loop. An alternate sticky journey model makes customers? lives exciting, with a cyclical pattern of unpredictable experiences that increases customer involvement over time, conceptualized here as an involvement spiral. Whereas the smooth journey model is ideal for instrumental services that facilitate jobs to be done, the sticky journey model is ideal for recreational services that facilitate never-ending adventures. To match the flow of each journey type, firms are advised to encourage purchases during the initial service cycles of smooth journeys, or subsequent service cycles of sticky journeys. In multiservice systems, firms can sustain customer journeys by interlinking loyalty loops and involvement spirals. The article concludes with new journey-centered questions for customer experience management research, as well as branding research, consumer culture theory, consumer psychology, and transformative service research.",0
Implementing Quality Improvement Programs Designed to Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Quasi-Experiments in the United States and Spain,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"A multinational firm uses sophisticated, state-of-the-art methods to design and implement customer satisfaction improvement programs in the United States and Spain. Quasi-experimental analysis reveals a complex and surprising picture that highlights (1) implementation issues (empowerment), (2) a construct of residual satisfaction not captured by customer needs, and (3) the managerial need for combining nonequivalent controls and nonequivalent dependent variables.",1
The Surprising Breadth of Harbingers of Failure,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Previous research has shown that there exist ?harbinger customers? who systematically purchase new products that fail (and are discontinued by retailers). This article extends this result in two ways. First, the findings document the existence of ?harbinger zip codes.? If households in these zip codes adopt a new product, this is a signal that the new product will fail. Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes. Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live, rather than households influencing their neighbors? tendencies.",1
Executive Insights: International Marketing?Avoiding the Seven Deadly Traps,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"When firms expand beyond single market boundaries, problems grow exponentially. Poor selection of markets, underestimation of competitors, misunderstanding of customer differences, and entry at the wrong price are all common pitfalls. So, too, are the failure to contemplate what expansion within any one market will imply and the choice of inappropriate partners.",0
Achieving Marketing Objectives through Social Sponsorships,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The corporate social responsibility literature has focused on creating broad associations, such as simply being ?socially responsible,? and on the simple transfer of positive affect from sponsored causes to sponsoring firms. Both views fail to recognize the power of social initiatives as a means for differentiating among socially responsible firms and, in particular, for reinforcing the brand's positioning. The authors adopt a more traditional branding perspective and show that the fit between a firm's specific associations and a sponsored cause can reinforce or blur the firm's positioning, influence liking for the sponsorship, and bolster or undermine the firm's equity. They also show that communications decisions can mitigate the negative effects of low fit. Finally, they show that sponsorship effects can persist for as long as a year despite day-to-day exposure to other brand communications.",0
Cultural Superstitions and the Price Endings Used in Chinese Advertising,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"In traditional Chinese superstition, the numerical digit 8 is associated with prosperity and good luck and the digit 4 is associated with death. An examination of the price endings used in a sample of Chinese price advertisements indicates a distinct tendency to favor the digit 8 and to avoid the digit 4. These results constitute evidence of the role of superstition in the Chinese marketplace and provide guidance for setting prices in this increasingly important market.",0
State-Dependent Demand Estimation with Initial Conditions Correction,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The authors analyze the initial conditions bias in the estimation of brand choice models with structural state dependence. Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and empirical case studies of shopping panels, they show that popular, simple solutions that misspecify the initial conditions are likely to lead to bias even in relatively long panel data sets. The magnitude of the bias in the state dependence parameter can be as large as a factor of 2?2.5. The authors propose a solution to the initial conditions problem that samples the initial states as auxiliary variables in a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The approach assumes that the joint distribution of prices and consumer choices is in equilibrium, which is plausible for the mature consumer packaged goods products commonly used in empirical applications. In Monte Carlo simulations, the approach recovers the true parameter values even in relatively short panels. Finally, the authors propose a diagnostic tool that uses common, biased approaches to bound the values of the state dependence and construct a computationally light test for state dependence.",1
Lessons from an ?Oops? at Consumer Reports: Consumers Follow Experts and Ignore Invalid Information,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"In 2007, Consumer Reports released, and two weeks later retracted, a flawed report on the safety of infant car seats. Analyzing data from 5471 online auctions for car seats ending before, during, and after the information was considered valid, this article shows that (1) consumers responded to the new information and, more surprisingly, (2) they promptly ceased to do so when it was retracted. Because of the random nature of the flawed ratings, this first finding demonstrates that expert advice has a causal effect on consumer demand. The second finding suggests that people's inability to willfully ignore information is not as extreme as the experimental evidence in the psychological literature suggests.",1
Determinants of Customers? Responses to Customized Offers: Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Marketers have been challenged by proponents of individual (one-to-one) marketing to shift from focusing on market segments to making individually customized offers. Building on current knowledge regarding the construction of customers? preferences, the author examines the basic assumptions underlying individual marketing and presents a process model of customers? responses to customized offers. The model addresses (1) preference development, (2) evaluation of customized offers, (3) likelihood of purchasing the customized offers, and (4) maintenance of relationships with one-to-one marketers. The analysis leads to specific propositions regarding determinants of customers? responses to customized offers. The author discusses future research directions and managerial implications.",0
Vices and Virtues of Misguided Replications: The Case of Asymmetric Dominance,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The likelihood of replicating an effect such as asymmetric dominance (AD) largely depends on other, usually more important choice drivers (e.g., attributes, values). Accordingly, it is not surprising that the AD effect is often not observed when other choice drivers have greater impact and/or when the AD configuration is unlikely to be perceived. However, when price is an attribute (and in many other cases), the AD effect is often observed in both properly designed studies and the real world. The author notes that Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) raise important questions, but they would have made a greater contribution had they (1) systematically studied the drivers of AD perceptions, (2) more accurately tried to replicate previous AD effect demonstrations, and (3) systematically studied the repulsion effect. The author also briefly comments on the Yang and Lynn (2014) studies, which he asserts did not test the AD effect properly in most cases.",1
Making the World a Better Place: How Crowdfunding Increases Consumer Demand for Social-Good Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative means of financing new ventures wherein a large number of individuals collectively back a project. This research specifically examines reward-based crowdfunding, in which those who take part in the crowdfunding process receive the new product for which funding is sought in return for their financial support. This work illustrates that consumers make fundamentally different decisions when considering whether to contribute their money to crowdfund versus purchase a product. Six studies demonstrate that compared with a traditional purchase, crowdfunding more strongly activates an interdependent mindset and, as a result, increases consumer demand for social-good products (i.e., products with positive social and/or environmental impact). The research further highlights that an active involvement in the crowdfunding process is necessary to increase demand for social-good products: when a previously crowdfunded product is already to market, the effect is eliminated. Finally, it is demonstrated that crowdfunding participants exhibit an increased demand for social-good products only when collective efficacy (i.e., one?s belief in the collective?s ability to bring about change) is high.",1
"Market Orientation, Relationship Marketing Orientation, and Business Performance: The Moderating Effects of Economic Ideology and Industry Type",Journal of International Marketing,2005,"This study examines how economic ideology and industry type moderate the impacts of market orientation and relationship marketing orientation on business performance. The authors collected data through a survey of firms in both Mainland China and Hong Kong. They selected these two economies because they have similarities in cultural dimensions and differences in economic dimensions. The authors find support for the moderating effect of economic ideology and industry type on the link among market orientation, relationship marketing orientation, and business performance.",0
Factors Associated with Effective use of Export Assistance,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"The export sector has been the highlight of recent U.S. economic performance, underscoring the importance of exporting as a strategic choice in the internationalization of the firm. However, firms commonly face export barriers and seek, or accept, export assistance to overcome them. Public sector organizations are an important source of export assistance. This study examines factors associated with effective use of export assistance by utilizing the results of a mail survey of 89 Minnesota firms assisted by a state agency. The results suggest that the commitment/persistence of management is a more important factor in export promotion than either the export stage or the services used by the firm.",0
Performance Productivity and Quality of Frontline Employees in Service Organizations,Journal of Marketing,2000,"To understand mechanisms that govern the productivity and quality of frontline employees (FLEs), this study (1) provides a conceptual distinction between frontline productivity and quality, (2) proposes an extended role theory?based model for mapping the influence of key antecedents and consequences of FLE productivity and quality, and (3) examines the effects of coping resources?boss support and task control?in helping employees cope with the inherent productivity?quality tension in frontline jobs. Using data from 159 customer service and 147 bill collection representatives, the author examines proposed hypotheses through multiple-group path analysis. The results indicate support for the distinction between productivity and quality. Moreover, with increasing burnout levels, FLEs are found to maintain their productivity levels while their quality deteriorates directly. Relative to boss support, task control emerges as a more powerful resource in aiding FLEs in coping with role tension. Key implications for theory and practice regarding FLE management and effectiveness are discussed.",0
The Role of Moral Intensity and Personal Moral Philosophies in the Ethical Decision Making of Marketers: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of China and the United States,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"This study uses cross-cultural samples from the United States and China to replicate previous empirical findings regarding the relationship among moral philosophies, moral intensity, and ethical decision making. The authors use a two-step structural equations modeling approach to analyze the measurement and structural models. The findings partially replicate those from previous studies and provide evidence that the measurement model is somewhat invariant across the two groups studied but the structural model is not. In addition, there is evidence that the relationship between personal moral philosophies (mainly relativism) and moral intensity varies across the two cultures. That is, whereas relativism is a significant predictor of moral intensity for the Chinese sample, it is not for the U.S. sample. However, idealism is a significant predictor of perceived moral intensity for both samples of marketing practitioners. Finally, perceived moral intensity is a significant, direct predictor of ethical judgments, and ethical judgments are a significant, direct predictor of behavioral intentions in both instances.",0
Business-to-Business E-Negotiations and Influence Tactics,Journal of Marketing,2020,"E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates salespeople?s use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers? attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople?s influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers? attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.",0
Modeling Preferences for Common Attributes in Multicategory Brand Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors propose a multicategory brand choice model based on the conceptualization that the intrinsic utility for a brand is a function of underlying attributes, some of which are common across categories. The premise is that household preferences for attributes that are common across categories are likely to be correlated. The model that the authors develop projects the unobserved preferences for attributes to a lower dimensional space of unobserved factors. The factors are interpretable as household ?traits? that transcend categories, and they can be used to predict preferences for attributes in new categories. The authors apply the proposed model to household panel data for three closely related snack categories and for two less-related food categories. The authors find strong correlations in preferences for product attributes such as brand names and low fat or fat free. This study demonstrates that these high correlations in product attribute preferences across categories are useful in targeting activities in existing and new categories.",1
Role of Ambient Temperature in Influencing Willingness to Pay in Auctions and Negotiations,Journal of Marketing,2019,"While temperature?s effects on human physiology have been well studied, its effects in decision-making contexts are still relatively unknown. The authors investigate the role of ambient temperature in one important decision-making context: consumer purchase. More specifically, they examine how ambient temperature influences consumers? willingness to pay in different kinds of purchase contexts, such as in auctions and in negotiations. The authors show that whereas higher (vs. moderate) temperatures elicit higher willingness to pay in auctions, they lead to a lower willingness to pay in negotiations, and temperature-induced discomfort and aggression underlie these effects. The authors also study the effects of lower temperatures and extend these findings to more general competitive settings. They report findings from six studies and discuss theoretical, managerial, and policy implications.",0
How Time Horizon Perceptions and Relationship Deficits Affect Impulsive Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The authors examine how different types of relationship deficits (emotional vs. social) and time horizon perceptions (expanded vs. limited) affect consumers? impulsive behaviors. Emotional deficits refer to a lack of intimate attachment, whereas social deficits refer to a lack of social connections. Some people view time as expanded, whereas others view it as limited. Essential relationship deficits are defined as a lack of social connections for people with an expanded time horizon and a lack of emotional attachments for people with a limited time horizon. Inessential relationship deficits, conversely, are a lack of emotional attachments for people with an expanded time horizon and a lack of social connections for people with a limited time horizon. The authors reveal that people who experience essential relationship deficits are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors than those who experience inessential relationship deficits, because the experience of essential relationship deficits depletes them. The authors report the convergent results of impulsive behaviors, both in terms of engagement in unplanned behaviors and in terms of preference toward short-term gratification across self-reported intentions, as well as actual behaviors.",1
"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right: Music Piracy and Pricing in a DRM-Free Environment",Journal of Marketing,2010,"The music industry has widely viewed digital rights management (DRM) as an effective strategy for reducing digital piracy. Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers? willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the findings for managers within the music industry.",0
Preventing Digital Music Piracy: The Carrot or the Stick?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The goal of this article is to ascertain the factors that govern consumers? willingness to pirate a digital product, such as a digital music track. The authors assess the tendency to pirate with both indirect measures (e.g., willingness to pay for the legal alternative) and direct measures (e.g., piracy preference). Whether measured indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g., perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy tendencies for others. Conversely, positive incentives, such as improved functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all the consumer segments studied. The authors conclude by discussing prescriptive recommendations for the recording industry.",0
"Consumer Trust, Value, and Loyalty in Relational Exchanges",Journal of Marketing,2002,"The authors develop a framework for understanding the behaviors and practices of service providers that build or deplete consumer trust and the mechanisms that convert consumer trust into value and loyalty in relational exchanges. The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and management policies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key mediator of the trust?loyalty relationship. The authors test the proposed model using data from two service contexts?retail clothing (N = 264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant ?negativity? effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving orientation has a dominant ?positivity? effect (i.e., a unit positive performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance). Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of management policies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two industries examined in the study, while remaining sensitive to essential contextual differences.",0
Branded Service Encounters: Strategically Aligning Employee Behavior with the Brand Positioning,Journal of Marketing,2013,"This research examines how branded service encounters, in which frontline service employee behavior is aligned with a firm's brand positioning, may positively affect customer responses to brands. Across two brand personality contexts, Study 1 demonstrates that employee?brand alignment increases overall brand evaluations and customer-based brand equity, with more pronounced results for unfamiliar brands. Study 2 shows that conceptual fluency underlies the effect of employee?brand alignment on overall brand evaluations for unfamiliar brands. Study 3 reveals that employee authenticity enhances the effectiveness of employee?brand alignment. Finally, a critical incident study (Study 4) extends the generalizability of these findings to a wider variety of service contexts. This research is the first to demonstrate how firms can leverage employee behavior as a brand-building advantage, particularly for new or unfamiliar brands as they establish their positioning with customers.",0
Modeling Purchase Behavior at an E-Commerce Web Site: A Task-Completion Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors develop and estimate a model of online buying using clickstream data from a Web site that sells cars. The model predicts online buying by linking the purchase decision to what visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the authors decompose the purchase process into the completion of sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity across visitors at the county level. Using a sequence of binary probits, the authors model the visitor's decision of whether to complete each task for the first time, given that the visitor has completed the previous tasks at least once. The results indicate that visitors' browsing experiences and navigational behavior predict task completion for all decision levels. The results also indicate that the number of repeat visits per se is not diagnostic of buying propensity and that a site's offering of sophisticated decision aids does not guarantee increased conversion rates. The authors also compare the predictive performance of the task-completion approach with single-stage benchmark models in a holdout sample. The proposed approach provides superior prediction and better identifies likely buyers, especially early in the task sequence. The authors also discuss implications for Web site managers.",1
An Examination of Organizational Factors Influencing New Product Success in Internal and Alliance-Based Processes,Journal of Marketing,2000,"New products provide increased sales, profits, and competitive strength for most organizations. However, nearly 50% of the new products that are introduced each year fail. Organizations thus find themselves in a double bind. On the one hand they must innovate consistently to remain competitive, but on the other hand innovation is risky and expensive. Many organizations are forming business alliances to quicken the pace of and reduce risks associated with innovation. Yet by some estimates, 70% of these alliances fail. Many of the prescriptions for successful alliance management clash with recommendations for effective innovation management. The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the new products and alliance literature. A construct?cooperative competency?derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment, absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether it is an intra- or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and replicate it in the health care sector. The antecedents of cooperative competency?formalized and clannish administration, mutual dependence, and institutional support?are revealed empirically and substantiated. The authors identify the importance and means of developing interfirm cooperation.",0
"Service Quality: The Impact of Frequency, Timing, Proximity, and Sequence of Failures and Delights",Journal of Marketing,2014,"Service delivery often involves a series of events or stages of exchange between a service provider and its customer. At each stage, performance can meet, exceed, or fall below the customer's expectations. This article contributes to the literature by examining how the patterns of distribution (frequency, timing, proximity, and sequence) of service failures and delights affect customers? perceptions of service quality. The authors propose a conceptual model based on mental accounting principles derived from prospect theory and develop a series of research propositions to explicate the links between distribution patterns of service failures/delights and service quality perceptions. The study integrates prospect theory with service encounter research and provides a comprehensive theory-driven platform for exploring the impact of various service failure and delight distribution patterns. In addition, it offers important managerial implications for service design and resource allocation regarding when, how often, how close, and in what order delights and failures should take place to maximize gains from delights and minimize losses from failures.",0
Relationship Value: Drivers and Outcomes in International Marketing Channels,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Although collaborative business arrangements based on relationship marketing have become ubiquitous over the past decades, research studies of relationship value in international marketing channels are scarce. Drawing on the relational view of competitive advantage, this study investigates the drivers of relationship value in exporter?importer relationships and its impact on customer loyalty. The study findings reveal that relationship-specific investments, knowledge sharing, complementary capabilities, and relational norms are powerful contributors of importer-perceived value in an overseas supplier relationship. Importantly, exporter cultural sensitivity weakens the negative effect of psychic distance on relationship value; when cultural sensitivity is low, psychic distance takes on greater importance in attenuating relationship value, whereas when cultural sensitivity is high, psychic distance has no discernible effect. In addition, the results demonstrate that relationship value results in insensitivity to competitive offerings and future purchase expansion. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for international marketing theory and practice.",0
Customer Equity Sustainability Ratio: A New Metric for Assessing a Firm's Future Orientation,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Securitization is a remarkable financial instrument; it enables securitizers to increase their short-term profits at the expense of the long-term value of their customer base. This ability might be tempting for firms, especially because it does not need to be disclosed transparently to stakeholders. The authors show how their newly developed customer equity sustainability ratio (CESR) complements customer equity reporting and creates more transparency about the consequences of securitization for future earnings and the riskiness of the underlying business model. Their model compares the future value of an existing customer base with current earnings. In an empirical study of 38 banks in ten countries, the authors demonstrate the limited transparency of long-term value creation in financial statements. Next, they outline the adequacy of CESR for creating more transparency in empirical cases of Countrywide Financial Corporation and nine firms from nonbanking industries. They recommend that marketing should play a prominent role in providing stakeholders with substantial information about the long-term value of the customer base.",0
Planned Marketing Adaptation and Multinationals? Choices between Acquisitions and Greenfields,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"International marketing studies have extensively examined the antecedents of firms? marketing standardization/ adaptation decisions. However, it is unclear whether such decisions, once planned, codetermine the choice between buying and building foreign subsidiaries. Analyzing a sample of 150 foreign entries by Dutch firms, the authors find that the level of marketing adaptation planned for a wholly owned subsidiary is positively related to the likelihood that the subsidiary will be established through an acquisition rather than through a greenfield investment. Moreover, the authors find substantial evidence that this positive relationship is stronger for firms that (1) are establishing relatively larger subsidiaries, (2) have less experience with the industry entered, or (3) are entering less developed countries. The findings show that firms pursuing higher levels of marketing adaptation assign more value to the marketing adaptation advantages of acquisitions over greenfields, especially if the risks associated with implementing the planned adaptation level are high. In addition, firms typically strive for a fit between their international marketing strategy and their mode of foreign establishment.",0
The Short- and Long-Term Impact of an Assortment Reduction on Category Sales,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In a collaborative study with a major Dutch retailer, the authors assess the short- and long-term effects of a 25% item reduction on category sales. On an aggregate level, a major assortment reduction can lead to substantive short-term category sales losses but only a weak negative long-term category sales effect. Short-term category sales losses are caused mainly by fewer category purchases by former buyers of delisted detergent items. However, the results also show that the assortment reduction attracts new category buyers. These new buyers partially offset the sales losses among former buyers of the delisted items. The collection of supplemental process data on assortment perceptions and actual search time in the test stores before and after the assortment reduction provides evidence that delisting results in an increase in perceived search efficiency and a decrease in actual search time.",1
Product Development Team Stability and New Product Advantage: The Role of Decision-Making Processes,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Innovation scholars have long touted the value of cross-functional teams, and though firms have embraced a cross-functional design in their new product development (NPD) teams, these teams continue to face challenges. Stability in an NPD team may offer important advantages for decision making; however, its effectiveness as a structural coordination mechanism remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to offer insight into the value of NPD team stability, the authors develop a process-based model that examines the extent to which stability influences certain decision-making processes, which in turn influence new product advantage. They examine these relationships with a sample of cross-functional NPD project teams from 208 high-technology firms. The results reveal that the degree of stability in an NPD project team has a curvilinear relationship to team-level debate and decision-making comprehensiveness. In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness is positively related to new product advantage only at high levels. These curvilinear patterns shed light on anecdotal evidence that currently attributes success to both stable and unstable project teams.",0
Longitudinal Shifts in the Drivers of Satisfaction with Product Quality: The Role of Attribute Resolvability,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Research on customer equity has reemphasized the value of understanding the factors that influence satisfaction and quality. Although research has shown that many factors influence perceptions of satisfaction and quality, it has failed to consider the potential for asymmetric effects that shift over time and are based on the attributes used to form such perceptions. Using automobile ownership experiences during the manufacturer warranty period, the authors show that as consumers approach the end of their product's warranty period, satisfaction with attributes that can be remedied (?resolvable? attributes) declines at a greater rate, yet its effect on satisfaction with product quality intensifies. In contrast, satisfaction with attributes that cannot be remedied (?irresolvable? attributes) declines at a lesser rate, and its effect on satisfaction with product quality weakens over time. The authors also discuss implications for research and customer relationship management programs.",1
The Role of Firm Resources in Returns to Market Deployment,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Researchers in marketing tend to adopt one of two approaches to examining competitive advantage: a focus on a firm's resources or a focus on a firm's strategic or tactical actions. The authors suggest that neither of these approaches by itself fully captures the drivers of competitive advantage. Focusing on marketing-specific actions referred to as market deployment, the authors investigate the roles of both resources and action by examining how the nature and level of a firm's resources influence the success of the firm's marketing actions. The results, based on a secondary data approach and a series of sequentially estimated hierarchical regression models, indicate that resource possession influences returns to market deployment. Specifically, higher levels of intangible marketing resources and intangible technological resources increase the effectiveness of market deployment related to distribution and coupon activity, whereas higher levels of financial resources decrease the effectiveness of these types of market deployment.",1
The Impact of Brand Equity and Innovation on the Long-Term Effectiveness of Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Although managers often hope to obtain long-term benefits with temporary marketing actions, academic studies imply that their chances are slim. Extant research has implicitly assumed that the brand itself carries no influence over whether marketing promotions have the power to lift sales permanently. Using panel data for seven years from 100 brands across seven product categories, the authors employ a two-stage approach in which long-term promotional effectiveness is first estimated with persistence modeling and then these effectiveness estimates are related to brand equity and new product introductions. By examining a broad range of brands in each category, the authors find that positive sales evolution from promotional efforts is fairly common, especially for small brands. Moreover, the authors find that both permanent and cumulative sales effects from marketing promotions are greater for brands with higher equity and more product introductions, whereas brands with low equity gain greater benefits from product introductions. These results offer new research and managerial insights into the presence and conditions for persistent benefits from marketing promotions.",1
The Face of Need: Facial Emotion Expression on Charity Advertisements,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Advertisements for charities often display photographs of the people they help to evoke the kind of sympathy that engenders giving. This article examines how the expression of emotion on a victim's face affects both sympathy and giving. Building on theories of emotional contagion and sympathy the authors propose that (1) people ?catch? the emotions displayed on a victim's face and (2) they are particularly sympathetic and likely to donate when they see sad expressions versus happy or neutral expressions. Consistent with emotional contagion, participants felt sadder when viewing a sad-faced victim, and their own sadness mediated the effect of emotion expression on sympathy. Contagion effects are automatic and noninferential, but they are diminished by deliberative thought. The authors discuss the implications of using subtle emotional expressions on charitable and other marketing appeals.",1
A Three-Stage Model of Integrated Marketing Communications at the Marketing-Sales Interface,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning system.",1
Simultaneous Signaling and Screening with Warranties,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"It is well known that sellers can use warranties to screen consumers and increase profits. The ability of warranties to signal is also well accepted. The author considers a situation in which a high quality seller needs warranty policy to both screen and signal. Through an analytical model, the objective is to identify the optimal strategy for a high quality seller that offers a base warranty and optional extended warranty for a product whose quality is not observable to buyers. The author finds that signaling can limit a seller's ability to screen, especially when buyers are willing to pay a significant premium for higher quality. To signal, the seller generally lengthens base warranties and shortens optional coverage, making the bundles for each type of buyer more and more similar. The author also provides an empirical application of the model in the Toronto used-car market.",1
The Left-Digit Bias: When and Why Are Consumers Penny Wise and Pound Foolish?,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Consumers? price evaluations are influenced by the left-digit bias, wherein consumers judge the difference between $4.00 and $2.99 to be larger than that between $4.01 and $3.00, even though the numeric differences are identical. This research examines when and why consumers are more likely to fall prey to the left-digit bias. The authors propose that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based price evaluations, wherein people see the focal price and the reference price side by side, and weaker in memory-based price evaluations, wherein people have to retrieve at least one price from memory. This is because in stimulus-based price evaluations, people tend to rely on perceptual representations of prices without rounding them. In memory-based price evaluations, they rely more on conceptual representations, which makes them more likely to round the prices. Results from six studies?five experiments and a scanner panel study?support the hypothesis that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based evaluations. These results inform managers about when to use left-digit pricing and characterize fundamental differences between stimulus-based and memory-based evaluations.",1
A Framework for Analysis of Strategy Development in Globalizing Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"This article describes the development of an analytical framework of strategic behavior in globalizing markets, based on different strands of literature (internationalization process, strategic groups, intra-industry trade, and global management). The framework consists of a three-by-three matrix with the following dimensions: the global structure of the industry (industry globality) and the firm's preparedness for internationalization. In each of the nine resulting cells (?The Nine Strategic Windows?) the author discusses consequences for strategic behavior of the firm. The author makes concrete suggestions on company strategy, varying from ?stay at home? to ?strengthen your global position.? In order to illustrate the framework, the study of a Norwegian ship equipment manufacturer is briefly discussed.",0
Educator Insights: Standardization or Adaptation of the International Marketing Mix: The Role of the Local Subsidiary/Representative,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"In this article, the author suggests that the standardization versus customization issue in international marketing has important organizational aspects that are often neglected in the literature. The author parts from the traditional culture and economies of scale approaches by introducing a taxonomy of international marketing organizations based on headquarters versus subsidiary decision power and on market knowledge at headquarters. The author then suggests a typology of organizational solutions?local baronies, civil war, confederation, and federation?and describes two case studies to illustrate how firms ?travel? in the model. Finally, the author develops several propositions and discusses managerial implications.",0
The Perennial Issue of Adaptation or Standardization of International Marketing Communication: Organizational Contingencies and Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"The author investigates the standardization/adaptation issue in international advertising from an organizational perspective, introducing two variables: knowledge of local market conditions at the center (exporter/headquarters level) and headquarters? influence on local marketing decisions. The author interviewed 150 Norwegian exporters by mail on their experience in this respect. The results reveal that the two dimensions indeed have some impact on how firms develop their international marketing strategies. Knowledge of local market conditions seems to play an overriding role, leading to a more standardized approach by firms. Not surprisingly, centralized decision power seems to lead to more negative reactions at the intermediary level. In contrast, firms that have a more relaxed stance on the standardization issue and leave the marketing decisions to the local representatives seem to have better relations with these representatives than do other firms. The author discusses implications for global brand management and research.",0
Product Complexity and Cultural Distance Effects on Managing International Distributor Relationships: A Contingency Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"How should an exporter manage its relationship with its intermediaries given different levels of performance ambiguity? The author addresses this question by exploring four different settings of performance ambiguity that involve cultural distance (external uncertainty) and product complexity (internal uncertainty). Using a sample of 173 Norwegian exporting companies, the author analyzes relational drivers? effect on relationship quality between trading partners?namely, exporters and their distributors. The results suggest that cultural distance and product complexity are two key contingency factors that moderate the role of relational mechanisms used by exporters in creating relationship quality with their foreign sales intermediaries. The author concludes by discussing implications for research and management.",0
"A Taxonomy of the Pricing Practices of Exporting Firms: Evidence from Austria, Norway, and the United States",Journal of International Marketing,2006,"In this qualitative study, the authors offer a framework through which they examine the information use, strategic approach, and managerial control behavior in the export pricing practices of 24 firms based in Austria, Norway, and the United States. They offer propositions about export pricing behavior and suggestions for empirical research in the field.",0
Earmarking and Partitioning: Increasing Saving by Low-Income Households,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research examines the effects of earmarking money on savings by low-income consumers. In particular, the authors test two interventions that are designed to enhance the effects of earmarking: (1) using a visual reminder of the savings goal and (2) dividing the earmarked money into two parts. Consistent with prior research suggesting that partitioning increases self-control, people save more when earmarked money is partitioned into two accounts than when it is pooled into one account. In addition, the presence of the visual reminder increases the savings rate. The authors conclude with implications for consumer welfare and directions for further research.",1
Transaction Decoupling: How Price Bundling Affects the Decision to Consume,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"In today's marketplace, price bundling is widespread: Manufacturers and retailers routinely offer multiple products for a single, bundled price. Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or ?decoupling? of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.",1
The Fewer the Better: Number of Goals and Savings Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article examines the effect of the number of goals on consumers? savings behavior. Drawing from research on implementation intention, the authors show that under certain conditions, presenting a single savings goal leads to greater savings intention and actual savings than presenting multiple savings goals. Multiple goals typically evoke trade-offs among competing goals and thus increase the likelihood that people will remain in a deliberative mind-set and defer actions. In contrast, the authors propose and demonstrate that a single goal evokes a stronger implementation intention, which in turn has a greater effect on behavior change. They also show that the advantage of a single goal over multiple goals on saving is attenuated when saving is easier to implement or when the multiple savings goals are integrated rather than competing among themselves. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",1
A Discrete?Continuous Model for Multicategory Purchase Behavior of Households,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This article provides an integrated utility-maximizing framework for households? multicategory purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity decisions. On a store visit, households maximize utility across several categories subject to an overall budget constraint. Then, they choose to purchase a subset of categories, in which they select a specific brand and an associated quantity level. Under their assumptions for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/ substitutability across categories. In addition, it accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the estimation. Thus, the three key features of multicategory models proposed in the literature are all reflected in the framework. The authors provide an empirical application of the methodology using four categories from the Stanford market basket data?laundry detergent, fabric softener, toilette tissue, and paper towel. The results indicate that, in general, cross-category effects, as measured by the cross-category price elasticities between brands in the categories, are small, and they arise mostly through consumers? joint purchase incidence decisions rather than at the purchase quantity decision conditional on brand choice. This finding indicates that the effects of coincidence are larger than the effects of complementarity in these data.",1
Determinants of Perceived Web Site Interactivity,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Interactivity is a key feature of Web sites. This article identifies the determinants that enhance user perceptions of interactivity in a communication scenario in which consumers send instant messages to an e-store. Two conceptualizations of interactivity?telepresence theory and interactivity theory?predict that different antecedents (e.g., the number of clicks, response time, message type) are important. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that message type (i.e., how personal a particular message is) is the strongest predictor of interactivity perceptions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the effects of message type on perceived interactivity and Web site effectiveness are greater when consumers are complaining than when they are inquiring about services. The results of Experiment 2 show that as the level of message personalization increases, interactivity perceptions and site effectiveness are enhanced (linear relationship). The authors discuss the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide directions for measuring and manipulating interactivity in further research.",0
Distinctive Marketing and Information Technology Capabilities and Strategic Types: A Cross-National Investigation,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"The authors examine the relationship between strategic type and development of distinctive marketing, market-linking, technology, and information technology (IT) capabilities to implement innovation strategy. They hypothesize that prospectors must build technical and IT capabilities, whereas defenders develop market-linking and marketing capabilities. The authors collect data from 709 firms across the United States, Japan, and China. They find support for their capability hypotheses, as well as for some of their cross-national hypotheses that are based on cultural and business environment differences among the three countries. In particular, they find support for the hypotheses that Japanese firms have greater technology and IT capabilities than U.S. firms of the same strategic type. They conclude with implications for management.",0
Does Innovativeness Moderate the Relationship between Cross-Functional Integration and Product Performance?,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"The authors examine the moderating effect of product innovativeness on cross-functional integration in Japanese and U.S. firms and test the contingency model with data from 788 Japanese and 612 U.S. new products. The results show that national culture affects integration patterns. Product innovativeness significantly moderates the integration?performance relationship in Japanese firms but not in U.S. firms. When developing highly innovative products, Japanese firms should increase the level of cross-functional integration in conducting technical activities (compared with marginally innovative products) but decrease the level of integration in conducting market analysis and launching activities. In U.S. firms, however, cross-functional integration has a similar effect for more and less innovative products. This may suggest the high cost of implementing a differentiated integration pattern in a strongly individualistic culture.",0
Consumers? Preference for User-Designed Versus Designer-Designed Products: The Moderating Role of Power Distance Belief,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Anecdotal evidence and extant research show that consumers can prefer both user-designed and designer-designed products. However, the factors that moderate such preferences are not well understood. The authors posit power distance belief (PDB) as a moderator such that low-PDB consumers prefer user-designed to designer-designed products because they identify more with user-driven companies. In contrast, high-PDB consumers prefer designer-designed to user-designed products due to their stronger trust in designer-driven companies. Six studies examining power distance belief at both the country and individual levels provide convergent support for the proposed moderating effect of PDB and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the interaction between design philosophy and PDB is more likely for low-complexity than high-complexity products.",1
The Role of Marketing in Developing Successful New Products in South Korea and Taiwan,Journal of International Marketing,1997,"Developing new products is an important activity for firms in the global, competitive marketplace. While marketing plays an important role in the process of developing new products, few studies have examined marketing's role in developing new products in East Asia. This research focuses on comparing marketing's contribution to the new product development process in South Korean and Taiwanese firms. South Korea and Taiwan have rapidly expanding economies that depend heavily on foreign exchange. In addition, these two countries have successfully transformed themselves from producing mainly low-value, labor-intensive goods to producing many high-value, high-technology products that require significant marketing savvy and proficiency. In this article, a model of the interrelationships among marketing resources, skills, activities, and new product performance is developed and tested using data on 372 recently developed South Korean new products and 306 recently developed Taiwanese new products. The results generally support the model, though some interesting differences were found between the two countries. It was found that merely possessing large quantities of marketing resources is not a key to new product success. Rather, the marketing skills derived from marketing resources and the proficiency in conducting marketing activities are important for successfully developing new products in South Korean and Taiwanese firms.",0
Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Managers? Conflict-Handling Behaviors,Journal of Marketing,2000,"In this study, the authors develop and test a cross-cultural conceptual model of the organizational-based antecedents and consequences of marketing managers? conflict-handling behaviors during the new product development process. The hypotheses were tested using data collected from 968 companies in Japan, China (Hong Kong), the United States, and the United Kingdom. The results provide some interesting insights regarding the varying role of conflict management among diverse cultures.",0
Estimating the Value of Brand-Image Associations: The Role of General and Specific Brand Image,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors present a Bayesian simultaneous choice factor model that measures consumers' willingness to pay for brand-image associations. Previous research has found that general brand effects influence a brand's scores on specific image dimensions. To investigate the value of general versus specific brand image, the authors specify a higher-order factor model in which a set of correlated factor scores arise from a general brand factor and a set of orthogonal residual scores that measure the specific dimensions of brand image. The general brand factor is consistent with the concept of a halo effect, which theory ascribes to either an overall evaluative effect or errors in cognition. The authors apply the model to stated preference data on branded midsized sedans accompanied by data on consumer brand-image associations. The authors find that there is substantial value for the specific dimensions of brand image, but only after controlling for the general brand effect with the higher-order factor decomposition.",1
Analyzing Client Profitability across Diffusion Segments for a Continuous Innovation,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"While a time-based segmentation approach to customer segmentation for new products allows firms to identify consumers in the innovator and early adopter segments, this study adds a profitability-based perspective to generate new insights. Using six years of data on the adoption of technology services over three generations from a large technology manufacturer?service provider across seven countries, the authors provide empirical evidence that the short-term and long-term profitability per period of clients in the early majority segment is the highest, followed by the late majority, the innovators, the early adopters, and the laggards, respectively. While a time-based segmentation approach enables firms to identify consumers who are likely to adopt new products sooner than others, a profitability-based perspective can complement their targeting strategy and enhance overall profits. Managers can make informed decisions on investments required to develop new markets with better estimates of the profitability of consumers from later segments. Our study offers managers the necessary insights to develop a road map for identifying and targeting the most profitable clients.",1
Technological Evolution and Radical Innovation,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Technological change is perhaps the most powerful engine of growth in markets today. To harness this source of growth, firms need answers to key questions about the dynamics of technological change: (1) How do new technologies evolve? (2) How do rival technologies compete? and (3) How do firms deal with technological evolution? Currently, the literature suggests that a new technology seems to evolve along an S-shaped path, which starts below that of an old technology, intersects it once, and ends above the old technology. This belief is based on scattered empirical evidence and some circular definitions. Using new definitions and data on 14 technologies from four markets, the authors examine the shape and competitive dynamics of technological evolution. The results contradict the prediction of a single S-curve. Instead, technological evolution seems to follow a step function, with sharp improvements in performance following long periods of no improvement. Moreover, paths of rival technologies may cross more than once or not at all.",0
The Effects of Brand Name Structure on Brand Extension Evaluations and Parent Brand Dilution,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Three laboratory experiments explore how alternative brand name structures (i.e., family branded or subbranded) and varying degrees of category similarity (i.e., similar or dissimilar) influence extension evaluations and parent brand dilution. The results indicate that subbranded extensions (e.g., Quencher by Tropicana cola) evoke a slower, more thoughtful subtyping processing strategy than family branded extensions (e.g., Tropicana cola), which evoke a faster, category-based processing strategy. As a result, category similarity affects extension evaluations when the extension is family branded but not when it is subbranded. In addition, dilution effects are only evident when consumers have a negative experience with a similar family branded extension. Subbranding thus offers two key benefits to marketers: It both enhances extension evaluations and protects the parent brand from any unwanted negative feedback.",1
New Product Preannouncements and Shareholder Value: Don't Make Promises you Can't Keep,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"New product preannouncements are strategic signals that firms direct at their customers, competitors, channel members, and investors. They have been touted as effective means of deterring competitor entry, informing potential customers, and even tipping the balance of technological standard battles in favor of the preannouncing firms. However, preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high. The findings offer executives of preannouncing firms clear guidelines on how to manage communications in the market to extract financial value from new product preannouncements.",1
Customer Satisfaction and Long-Term Stock Returns,Journal of Marketing,2016,"The authors reexamine the relation between customer satisfaction (measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index) and long-term stock returns using statistical tests that are well specified in the presence of industry clustering. Their results are consistent with those of Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), who find positive abnormal stock returns for companies with high levels of customer satisfaction. However, the authors also identify three caveats that could affect the robustness of this conclusion. First, the results critically depend on the manner in which industry is defined. Second, because Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult use a proprietary trading strategy that has not been disclosed to the general public, the authors are unable to discern what fraction of their reported performance is due to customer satisfaction as opposed to other characteristics of the trading strategy. Finally, because the authors also find positive abnormal returns for the entire American Customer Satisfaction Index sample, at least some of the performance reported by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult might be driven by sample characteristics unrelated to customer satisfaction. This article also provides useful guidance for measuring long-term abnormal returns in the presence of industry clustering.",0
Sources and Financial Consequences of Radical Innovation: Insights from Pharmaceuticals,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Radical innovations are engines of economic growth and the focus of much academic and practitioner interest, yet some fundamental questions remain unanswered. The authors use theoretical arguments on the risk associated with radical innovations, and the resources needed for them, to answer the following questions on the sources and financial consequences of radical innovation: (1) Who introduces a greater number of radical innovations: dominant or nondominant firms? (2) How great are the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards vary across dominant and nondominant firms? (3) Is it only a firm's resources in the aggregate or also its focus and leverage of resources that make its innovations more financially valuable? and (4) Which are more valuable: innovations that incorporate a breakthrough technology or innovations that provide a substantial increase in customer benefits? The authors pool information from a disparate set of sources in the pharmaceutical industry to study these questions. Results indicate that a large majority of radical innovations come from a minority of firms. The financial rewards of innovation vary dramatically across firms and are tied closely to firms? resource base. Firms that provide higher per-product levels of marketing and technology support obtain much greater financial rewards from their radical innovations than do other firms. Firms that have greater depth and breadth in their product portfolio also gain more from their radical innovations.",0
Why Some Acquisitions Do Better than Others: Product Capital as a Driver of Long-Term Stock Returns,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Corporate acquisitions are strategic actions that loom large in the minds of many senior managers. Despite decades of study, little systematic research exists on a central question: Why do the acquisitions of some firms perform better than those of others? The work that has examined this question has mostly focused on deal-specific variables (i.e., how the acquisitions are conducted). In this article, the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable?namely, product capital?that affects acquisition performance and predicts which firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors also present a mechanism by which product capital affects performance? namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment of targets' innovation potential. This article shows that firms with high product capital (i.e., those with greater product development and support assets) make smarter acquisition decisions. Such firms are better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying this potential to gain competitive advantage. The performance consequences of this superiority in the selection and deployment of target firms manifest in the long-term financial rewards to the acquiring firm. The results of an analysis of acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry across seven countries and over 11 years (1992?2002) provide empirical support for the arguments.",1
Innovation's Effect on Firm Value and Risk: Insights from Consumer Packaged Goods,Journal of Marketing,2008,"What is the relationship between innovation and firm value? Does the type of innovation make a difference? To answer these questions, the authors examine how breakthrough and incremental innovations affect three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic rents, and total firm risk. They argue that each of these metrics is of independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on economic rents or firm risk.",0
Executive Insights: Globalization?Scale versus Sensitivity,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article focuses on a subject with far-reaching implications for every business: the future of the relationship between consumers and the brand. At present, the marketing professional is faced with an important, gradually emerging dilemma. At a time when the consumer/brand relationship is most valued?for in its understanding lies success and profitability in every market?this relationship is simultaneously under threat of being seriously weakened.",0
Suppliers Caught in Supermarket Price Wars: Victims or Victors? Insights from a Dutch Price War,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"During retailer-initiated price wars (PWs), hundreds of brands are involved simultaneously, affecting brands? and retailers? positioning and ultimately making the performance outcome for individual brands difficult to predict. Likewise, the impact on brand performance after the PW, when prices are restored, is unclear. The authors use a natural-experiment approach to track brand sales and shares before, during, and after a long-lasting supermarket PW in the Dutch grocery market. They find that PWs are not truly revenue, sales, or share generators for most brands unless prices remain reduced permanently by the retailer. Only after the PW, when rivals? prices are restored and the focal brand's reduced retail price is maintained, can substantial sales, revenues, and share gains be realized. Moreover, restoring prices without additional price promotion support can severely damage brands? performance. Overall, national brands can gain share, sales, and revenue, but at the cost of not restoring regular prices, while private labels can benefit even when prices are restored after the PW ends.",1
A Conceptual Framework of Export Marketing Information Use: Key Issues and Research Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Information use within an export setting has been neglected in most studies? they focus instead on the acquisition of information rather than its use. Knowledge use as a topic, however, has been under investigation in the social sciences since the mid-1970s. Various conceptualizations have been developed, and emphasis has been placed upon the multidimensional nature of knowledge use. This article reviews the literatures on export information and general knowledge use, and integrates them into a model of export information use. Specifically, different types of information use are distinguished, their antecedents are identified, and their effect on export decision making and ultimate export success is indicated. A number of propositions to guide further research are also developed.",0
Export Information Use: A Five-Country Investigation of Key Determinants,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"Although information use is crucial for effective export decision making and ultimately export performance, most of the extant literature focuses on information acquisition rather than information use. Using data from a five-country survey of exporting firms, this study examines the impact of information-, export-, and context-specific variables on different types of export information use. The results show that the effects of these factors depend on the type of information use considered and the mode of information acquisition involved. The authors discuss implications of the findings and identify further research directions.",0
Cultural Distance and Psychic Distance: Two Peas in a Pod?,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"Cultural distance and psychic distance are two concepts that are widely used in the international business literature. A large number of studies use both concepts interchangeably with no clear distinction between them. The authors propose a new model to assess cultural distance and psychic distance separately. Through the use of survey data of more than 300 managers, this article shows that both concepts are conceptually different and that psychic distance is determined by cultural distance and the individual values of the managers.",0
The Impact of Exploitation and Exploration on Export Sales Growth: The Moderating Role of Domestic and International Collaborations,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"This study examines the short- and long-term implications of the impact of exploitation and exploration on export sales growth. It also explores the moderating role of external collaborations by differentiating between domestic collaborations and international collaborations. The authors tested their conceptual model with data from the U.K. Community Innovation Survey (2010?2016). Using different time lags for exploitation and exploration, the findings indicate that the impact varies over time. Specifically, they reveal that the effect of exploitation is negative in the long term but positive in the short term, while exploration has no significant effect in the short term but a positive influence on export sales growth in the long term. Similarly, the moderating effect of domestic and international collaborations has been found to vary over time. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications.",0
The Key Role of Managers? Values in Exporting: Influence on Customer Responsiveness and Export Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Values are an essential element explaining a person's attitudes and behavior. Therefore, it is surprising that despite the number of studies that have examined the organizational and managerial factors affecting export performance, little research has investigated the possible impact of a manager's individual values on strategic choice and the export performance of the firm. To address this gap in the literature, the authors examine the impact of managers? values on the firm's customer responsiveness and export performance. In addition, they examine the mediating role of customer responsiveness in the values?export performance linkage. The authors explore the empirical usefulness of the psychic distance construct by examining its direct link with export performance and the extent to which it moderates the relationship between individual values and export performance. Overall, the results suggest that managers? values significantly influence strategic decisions and the export performance of the firm, highlighting the need for more research attention in this area.",0
"Exit from a Foreign Market: Do Poor Performance, Strategic Fit, Cultural Distance, and International Experience Matter?",Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Although international entry and expansion has been a particularly important topic in the literature, there has been little research effort to explain firms? exit decisions from foreign markets. Drawing on the notion of fit theory together with moderation contingent logic, this study investigates the effects of international performance and internal strategic fit as well as the moderating impact of cultural distance and international experience on the firm's exit decision. The results indicate that strategic misfit and poor international performance have a detrimental effect on the firm's survival in the foreign market. Furthermore, the results suggest that cultural distance moderates the impact of the internal strategic fit and international performance on the exit decision. In addition, the authors find a significant three-way interaction between international performance, cultural distance, and international experience. Using data collected from multiple informants in Chinese outward foreign direct investment firms, this study generates new insights for academics and practitioners.",0
Mass-Communicated Prediction Requests: Practical Application and a Cognitive Dissonance Explanation for Self-Prophecy,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Marketers often promote socially beneficial actions or discourage antisocial behaviors to the benefit of their firms, target markets, and society as a whole. One means by which marketers accomplish such influence is a technique referred to as the ?self-prophecy effect,? or the behavioral influence of a person making a self-prediction. Researchers have yet to establish the efficacy of self-prophecy in influencing large target markets. In addition, the theoretical mechanism underlying the effect remains in question. The authors report two field studies that demonstrate successful application of self-prophecy through mass-communicated prediction requests. Furthermore, in three laboratory experiments, the authors provide theoretical support for a dissonance-based explanation for self-prophecy, and they discuss practical implications for marketers interested in influencing socially normative behavior.",0
Does the Internet Promote Better Consumer Decisions? The Case of Name-Your-Own-Price Auctions,Journal of Marketing,2006,The Internet has enabled consumers to make more informed decisions more conveniently with apparently more efficient price-clearing mechanisms than was available before its advent. One such mechanism is the name-your-own-price auction. The authors study the extent to which decisions made in such an auction are rational in relation to an economic model. The results from two independent markets show that a large number of consumers do not exhibit rational decision making.,0
The Hidden Minefields in the Adoption of Sales Force Automation Technologies,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Sales force automation technologies are increasingly used to support customer relationship management strategies; however, commentary in the practitioner press suggests high failure rates. The authors use identity theory as a lens to better understand salesperson perceptions associated with technology rejection. They collected survey data from 454 salespeople across two firms that had implemented sales force automation tools. The results indicate that immediately after training, salespeople had positive perceptions of the technology. However, six months after implementation, the technology had been widely rejected, and salesperson absenteeism and voluntary turnover had significantly increased. There were also significant decreases in perceptions of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, person?organization fit, and person?job fit across both firms. Finally, salespeople with stronger professional commitment indicated more negative job-related perceptions as experience with the technology increased.",0
Educator Insights: Euro Disney?What Happened? What Next?,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"In its first 18 months of operation, Euro Disney, a new theme park outside Paris, France, lost almost $1 billion. How could an improved version of a highly successful enterprise like Disneyland in California fare so poorly? This article attempts to highlight Disney's miscalculations in translating its theme park experiences from one culture to another, and suggests a possible course of action to address Euro Disney's problems.",0
More than Fit: Brand Extension Authenticity,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This article introduces a new determinant of brand extension success, brand extension authenticity (BEA), as a complement to fit. The authors develop the BEA construct and a scale to measure it and then demonstrate that BEA captures consumer perceptions of brand extension legitimacy and cultural contiguity along four interrelated but distinct dimensions: maintaining brand standards and style, honoring brand heritage, preserving brand essence, and avoiding brand exploitation. They demonstrate the power of BEA in predicting consumer reactions to brand extensions, particularly among consumers with strong self?brand connections. Not only is BEA distinct from two conceptualizations of fit in brand extension literature?fit as similarity and fit as relevance?but it also moderates the effects of both fit dimensions on brand extension responses. By capturing a cultural and consumer relational perspective that shapes reactions to brand extensions, BEA provides an important, complementary construct for predicting brand extension success and enhancing brand value. Brand managers attentive to BEA may be able to stretch brands further than assessments of fit alone would suggest, but they risk failure in otherwise well-fitting extensions perceived as inauthentic.",1
"Spotlights, Floodlights, and the Magic Number Zero: Simple Effects Tests in Moderated Regression",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"It is common for researchers discovering a significant interaction of a measured variable X with a manipulated variable Z to examine simple effects of Z at different levels of X. These ?spotlight? tests are often misunderstood even in the simplest cases, and it appears that consumer researchers are unsure how to extend them to more complex designs. The authors explain the general principles of spotlight tests, show that they rely on familiar regression techniques, and provide a tutorial demonstrating how to apply these tests across an array of experimental designs. Rather than following the common practice of reporting spotlight tests at one standard deviation above and below the mean of X, it is recommended that when X has focal values, researchers should report spotlight tests at those focal values. When X does not have focal values, it is recommended that researchers report ranges of significance using a version of Johnson and Neyman's test the authors term a ?floodlight.?",1
The Importance of a General Measure of Brand Engagement on Market Behavior: Development and Validation of a Scale,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Brand engagement in self-concept (BESC) is a generalized view of brands in relation to the self, with consumers varying in their tendency to include important brands as part of their self-concepts. The authors develop an eight-item scale to measure BESC and demonstrate that it captures a consumer's general engagement with brands. This scale successfully predicts consumers? differential attention to, memory of, and preference for their favorite brands. Brand engagement in self-concept is also related to differential brand loyalty, with high-BESC consumers being less price and time sensitive regarding their favorite brands than low-BESC consumers. The authors discuss the usefulness of this construct for marketing research.",1
Grocery Price Setting and Quantity Surcharges,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Quantity surcharges occur when the unit price of a brand's larger package is higher than the unit price of the same brand's smaller package. The authors examine how price-setting practices in the grocery industry help explain the existence of quantity surcharges. Two studies support the authors? contention that common pricing practices aimed at establishing a favorable store?price image can result in quantity surcharges. First, an experiment shows that consumer demand and the importance price setters place on establishing a low store?price image have an interactive effect on price-setting behavior. Second, an examination of retail sales volume, price, and cost data suggests that such price-setting reactions can result in quantity surcharges when certain asymmetries in demand exist across package sizes. The authors also discuss managerial and public policy implications along with areas for further study.",0
"Relating Online, Regional, and National Advertising to Firm Value",Journal of Marketing,2016,"Firms spend billions of dollars on advertising every year but remain uncertain about allocation across various advertising vehicles. Allocation decisions are even more complex as online advertising has proliferated and consumers? media usage patterns have become more fragmented. To determine advertising effectiveness, the authors group firms? advertising vehicle choices into three theoretically grounded and empirically verified smaller subsets: national, regional, and online advertising. Subsequently, they assess how the three advertising vehicles independently and jointly affect firm performance. Using 12 years of data covering 662 manufacturing firms, the authors find that while national, regional, and online advertising each have a positive and significant main effect on firm performance, each advertising vehicle weakens the effectiveness of the respective other two advertising vehicles (e.g., a 1% increase in online advertising increases firm performance by .32% but also decreases national [.15%] and regional [.03%] advertising effectiveness). A battery of robustness checks triangulates this result. Although all three media vehicles contribute to net increases in performance, the authors discuss the need to strategically integrate them to maximize combined effectiveness.",0
"Dynamic Marketing Budgeting for Platform Firms: Theory, Evidence, and Application",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this model-based recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%. Further normative analysis sheds light on how cross-market and carryover effects alter classical one-sided marketing budgeting rules.",1
Social Influence Effects in Online Product Ratings,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Websites prominently display consumers? product ratings, which influence consumers? buying decisions and willingness to pay. Few insights exist regarding whether a consumer's online product rating is prone to social influence from others? online ratings. Examining this issue, the authors hypothesize that other consumers? online ratings moderate the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience, product failure, and product recovery (to address product failure) on the reviewer's online product rating. The results from a model using 7499 consumers? online ratings of 114 hotels support the hypotheses. Other consumers? online ratings weaken the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience but can either exacerbate or overturn the negative effect of product failure, depending on the quality of product recovery. For marketing theory, the findings indicate that consumers who influence others are themselves influenced by other consumers and that this influence is contingent on their product experience. For managerial practice, the authors offer a method to estimate the effects of product experience characteristics on online product ratings and show that social influence effects make high online product ratings a double-edged sword, exacerbating the negative effect of product failure and strengthening the benefit of product recovery.",0
Dual Distribution and Intangible Firm Value: Franchising in Restaurant Chains,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Dual distribution systems in which firms use vertical integration and market governance simultaneously are widely used across diverse marketing contexts (e.g., restaurants, retailing, industrial selling). A prominent example of dual distribution includes business format franchising, in which firms (i.e., the franchisors) license the operation of some of their units to franchisees while owning and operating some units themselves. Despite the widespread prevalence of dual distribution, there are few insights into its performance implications. In this article, the author examines the relationship between a firm's dual distribution strategy and its intangible value. Franchising in restaurant chains serves as the empirical context for the study. It is proposed that a firm's dual distribution strategy affects its intangible value both independently and jointly with a set of firm characteristics. The author considers the firm's age, scope of vertical integration, advertising, financial leverage, and financial liquidity as firm characteristics that influence the relationship between dual distribution strategy and intangible value. The author measures the firm's dual distribution strategy by the proportion of its franchised units to its total units and intangible value by its Tobin's q. The author estimates the proposed model using panel data on 55 publicly listed U.S. restaurant chains for the period 1992?2002. Unobserved firm heterogeneity is accommodated using latent class regression analysis. The results support a four-segment model. Dual distribution increases intangible value for some firms but decreases intangible value for others, both independently and in conjunction with other firm characteristics.",0
Technological Opportunism and Radical Technology Adoption: An Application to E-Business,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Using the resource-based view of the firm, the authors hypothesize that differences in adoption of radical technologies among firms can be attributed to a sense-and-respond capability of firms with respect to new technologies, which is termed technological opportunism. Using survey data from senior managers in business-to-business firms, the authors study the adoption of e-business, a radical technology with the potential to alter business models. The authors first establish the distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs, such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing constructs do. In a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture and less of a hierarchy culture. The proposed technological opportunism construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing) development of technologies and the complementarities in technology orientation and market orientation in the firm. The results can be used by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms who seek to develop segmentation strategies based on the technological opportunism capabilities of their customer firms.",0
"First in, First out? The Effects of Network Externalities on Pioneer Survival",Journal of Marketing,2004,"Network externalities are playing an increasingly important role in the economy, and they have significant implications for firms? marketing strategies. The authors study the effects of network externalities in conjunction with other product and firm characteristics on the survival of pioneers. They apply an accelerated failure time model to data on 45 office products and consumer durables. The authors find evidence that network externalities have a negative main effect on the survival duration of pioneers. However, for more radical products and for technologically intense products, increases in network externalities are associated with increased survival duration. The larger the pioneer, the more network externalities increase its survival duration, whereas incumbent pioneers experience a decrease in survival duration compared with nonincumbents. The findings of this article contribute to theory in marketing strategy and have important implications for firms that are developing market entry strategies for products with network externalities.",0
The Emergence of Dominant Designs,Journal of Marketing,2006,"In many product categories, technological evolution results in the emergence of a single product design that achieves market dominance. In this article, the authors examine two questions: Will a dominant design emerge in a new product category? and If it does, how long will it be before a dominant design emerges? Thus, the authors simultaneously model the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the product's value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design in a new product category.",0
Should Firms Spend More on Research and Development and Advertising during Recessions?,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Whenever a recession occurs, there is a heated dialog among marketing academics and practitioners about the appropriate levels of marketing spending. In this article, the authors investigate whether firms should spend more on research and development (R&D) and advertising in recessions. They propose that the effects of changes in firms? R&D and advertising spending in recessions on profits and stock returns are contingent on their market share, financial leverage, and product-market profile (i.e., business-to-consumer goods, business-to-business services, business-to-business goods, or business-to-consumer services). They estimate the model using a panel of more than 10,000 firm-years of publicly listed U.S. firms from 1969 to 2008, during which there were seven recessions. Their results support the contingency approach. The authors compute the marginal effects, which show how the effects of changes in R&D and advertising spending in recessions vary across firms. The marginal effects provide evidence of inadequate spending (e.g., 98% of business-to-consumer goods firms underspend on R&D), proactivity (e.g., 96% of business-to-business services firms are at approximately the right levels on advertising). and excess spending (e.g., 92% of business-to-consumer services firms overspend on advertising). Using the authors? approach and publicly available data, managers can estimate the effects of their firms? and competitors? R&D and advertising spending on profits and stock returns in recessions.",0
Strategic Firm Commitments and Rewards for Customer Relationship Management in Online Retailing,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Academic studies offer a generally positive portrait of the effect of customer relationship management (CRM) on firm performance, but practitioners question its value. The authors argue that a firm's strategic commitments may be an overlooked organizational factor that influences the rewards for a firm's investments in CRM. Using the context of online retailing, the authors consider the effects of two key strategic commitments of online retailers on the performance effect of CRM: their bricks-and-mortar experience and their online entry timing. They test the proposed model with a multimethod approach that uses manager ratings of firm CRM and strategic commitments and third-party customers' ratings of satisfaction from 106 online retailers. The findings indicate that firms with moderate bricks-and-mortar experience are better able to leverage CRM for superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high bricks-and-mortar experience. Likewise, firms with moderate online experience are better able to leverage CRM into superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high online experience. These findings help resolve disparate results about the value of CRM, and they establish the importance of examining CRM within the strategic context of the firm.",0
With Power Comes Responsibility: How Powerful Marketing Departments Can Help Prevent Myopic Management,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Firms sometimes engage in myopic management (e.g., cutting marketing spending, providing lenient credit to customers to improve short-term results). Although marketing is at the center of such myopic management, there are few insights on whether a marketing department could prevent it. To address this gap, the authors examine the role of powerful marketing departments in preventing myopic marketing spending and revenue management. They hypothesize that there are internal and external enablers of marketing department power (i.e., a chief executive officer with marketing experience, the firm?s power over its customers, analyst coverage, and institutional stock ownership) that help a powerful marketing department prevent myopic management. They test the hypotheses using a panel of 781 publicly listed U.S. firms between 2000 and 2015. As hypothesized, when the firm has (1) a chief executive officer with a marketing background and (2) power over its customers, increasing marketing department power decreases the likelihood of both myopic marketing spending and myopic revenue management; increasing marketing department power and analyst coverage decreases the likelihood of myopic marketing spending. The findings highlight powerful marketing leadership as a hitherto overlooked way to prevent myopic management and improve firm performance.",0
Corporate Board Interlocks and New Product Introductions,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Firms? boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.",0
"Marketing and Firm Value: Metrics, Methods, Findings, and Future Directions",Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The marketing profession is being challenged to assess and communicate the value created by its actions on shareholder value. These demands create a need to translate marketing resource allocations and their performance consequences into financial and firm value effects. The objective of this article is to integrate the existing knowledge on the impact of marketing on firm value. The authors first frame the important research questions on marketing and firm value and review the important investor response metrics and relevant analytical models as they relate to marketing. Next, they summarize the empirical findings to date on how marketing creates shareholder value, including the impact of brand equity, customer equity, customer satisfaction, research and development and product quality, and specific marketing-mix actions. Then, the authors review emerging findings on biases in investor response to marketing actions. They conclude by formulating an agenda for future research challenges in this emerging area.",1
Demand-Based Pricing versus Past-Price Dependence: A Cost?Benefit Analysis,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors develop a conceptual framework of the factors that motivate a retailer's decision to rely on demand conditions and past prices in setting current and future prices. Specifically, they examine the circumstances under which retailers choose demand-based pricing versus past-price dependence for different brands and categories. Given scarce resources and costs of price adjustments, demand-based pricing is more likely when the customer-driven and firm-driven costs of adjusting pricing patterns are low or when the benefits of such adjustments are high. First, the customer-driven benefits of demand-based pricing are expected to be greater in categories with higher penetration and for brands with higher market share and higher demand sensitivity to price. Second, the firm-driven benefits are greater for categories with higher private-label share. Finally, the customer-driven costs are greater for expensive categories, whereas the firm-driven costs are greater for categories with many stockkeeping units. The empirical findings support the conceptual framework, implying that customer-driven and firm-driven benefits are the main stimulants in the retailer's choice of demand-based pricing. In contrast, customer-driven and firm-driven costs significantly hinder retailer implementation of demand-based pricing. These insights enable retailers to identify problem areas and opportunities to improve the allocation of scarce pricing resources. The results also contribute to the ongoing debate in economics and marketing on the rationality of observed past-price dependence. Whereas previous research points to the negative impact on gross margins of this practice, the authors find that retailers weigh the costs and benefits of demand-based pricing rather than adhere to past-pricing patterns.",0
"Product Innovations, Advertising, and Stock Returns",Journal of Marketing,2009,"Under increased scrutiny from top management and shareholders, marketing managers feel the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. In particular, how do customer value creation (through product innovation) and customer value communication (through marketing investments) affect stock returns? This article examines, conceptually and empirically, how product innovations and marketing investments for such product innovations lift stock returns by improving the outlook on future cash flows. The authors address these questions with a large-scale econometric analysis of product innovation and associated marketing mix in the automobile industry. They find that adding such marketing actions to the established finance benchmark model greatly improves the explained variance in stock returns. In particular, investors react favorably to companies that launch pioneering innovations, that have higher perceived quality, that are backed by substantial advertising support, and that are in large and growing categories. Finally, the authors quantify and compare the stock return benefits of several managerial control variables. The results highlight the stock market benefits of pioneering innovations. Compared with minor updates, pioneering innovations have an impact on stock returns that is seven times greater, and their advertising support is nine times more effective as well. Perceived quality of the new car introduction improves the firm's stock returns, but customer liking does not have a statistically significant effect. Promotional incentives have a negative effect on stock returns, indicating that price promotions may be interpreted as a signal of demand weakness. Managers can combine these return estimates with internal data on project costs to help decide the appropriate mix of product innovation and marketing investment.",0
Mind-Set Metrics in Market Response Models: An Integrative Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Demonstrations of marketing effectiveness currently proceed along two parallel tracks: Quantitative researchers model the direct sales effects of the marketing mix, and advertising and branding experts trace customer mind-set metrics (e.g., awareness, affect). The authors merge the two tracks and analyze the added explanatory value of including customer mind-set metrics in a sales response model that already accounts for short- and long-term effects of advertising, price, distribution, and promotion. Vector autoregressive modeling of the metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for almost one-third of explained sales variance. Competitive and own mind-set metrics make a similar contribution. Wear-in times reveal that mind-set metrics can be used as advance warning signals that allow enough time for managerial action before market performance itself is affected. Specific marketing actions affect specific mind-set metrics, with the strongest overall impact for distribution. The findings suggest that modelers should include mind-set metrics in sales response models and branding experts should include competition in their tracking research.",1
Monitoring the Dynamics of Brand Equity Using Store-Level Data,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Management of brand equity has come to be viewed as critical to a brand's optimal long-term performance. The authors evaluate the usefulness of brand equity estimates obtained from store-level data for monitoring the health of a brand. They use a random coefficients logit demand model calibrated on store-level scanner data to track brand equity estimates over time in two consumer packaged goods categories that experienced several new product introductions during the period of the empirical investigation. Using these tracked measures, the authors also study the impact of marketing actions, such as advertising, sales promotions, and product innovations, on brand equity. They find that the brand equity estimates effectively capture the high equity of strongly positioned popular brands and brands that command a significant price premium in niche markets. Using an example, the authors illustrate how these brand equity estimates can be used to monitor changes in brand equity, which measures such as market share may fail to capture. The substantive results indicate that advertising has a positive effect on brand equity in both the product categories, whereas the effect of sales promotions is not significant in either category. Furthermore, the results reveal that new product innovations have a positive impact on brand equity and can explain a significant proportion of its variation. Overall, the analysis shows that a brand manager can track brand equity using store-level data, gain insights into the drivers of the brand's equity, and manage these drivers to achieve brand equity targets.",0
Channel Negotiations with Information Asymmetries: Contingent Influences of Communication and Trustworthiness Reputations,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article reports three experiments that examine how communication types (informational, relational, and coercive messages) and mutual trustworthiness reputations influence sequential bargaining between an uncertain manufacturer and an informed distributor in a marketing channel. In Experiment 1, bargainers use informational and relational messages to establish a positive social tenor in the interaction. Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of high (versus low) trustworthiness also produce quicker and more efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits. However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad. Compared with no communication, relational messages elicit the most positive (negative) outcomes when trustworthiness reputations are high (low). Informational messages have a smaller but positive impact on bargaining outcomes in both trustworthiness conditions and appear to build trust.",1
Price Presentation Effects in Purchases Involving Trade-Ins,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"When a new purchase involves trading in an old item, the prices of component transactions may be presented in different ways. The authors report three studies that examine how different price presentations influence evaluations and choice in an otherwise equivalent overall exchange. Although consumers play both buyer and seller roles in purchases involving trade-ins, the authors find that consumers' evaluation of the overall exchange typically places more weight on the price of the new purchase than the trade-in. However, they also show that the weights can be shifted systematically by (1) directly manipulating the importance of the trade-in and (2) indirectly priming a seller (vs. buyer) mind-set. In these instances, consumers place more weight on the trade-in price than the price of the new purchase.",1
"When Does Corporate Social Irresponsibility Become News? Evidence from More Than 1,000 Brand Transgressions Across Five Countries",Journal of Marketing,2020,"Companies are increasingly held accountable for their corporate social irresponsibility (CSI). However, the extent to which a CSI event damages the firm largely depends on the coverage of this event in high-reach news media. Using the theory of news value developed in communications research, the authors explain the amount of media coverage by introducing a set of variables related to the event, the involved brand, and media outlet. The authors analyze a sample of 1,054 CSI events that were reported in 77 leading media outlets in five countries in the period 2008?2014. Estimation results reveal many drivers. For example, the number of media covering the story may be 39% higher for salient and strong brands. 80% more media report the event if a foreign brand is involved in a domestic CSI event. When a brand advertises heavily or exclusively in a news medium, this reduces the likelihood of the news medium to cover negative stories about the brand. The average financial loss at the U.S. stock market due to a CSI event amounts to US$321 million. However, the market reacts to the event only if 4 or more U.S. high-reach media outlets report on the event.",0
"The Impact of Brand Equity on Customer Acquisition, Retention, and Profit Margin",Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors investigate the relationships between brand equity and customer acquisition, retention, and profit margin, the key components of customer lifetime value (CLV). They examine a unique database from the U.S. automobile market that combines ten years of acquisition rate, retention rate, and customer profitability data with measures of brand equity from Young & Rubicam's Brand Asset Valuator (BAV) over the same period. They hypothesize and find that BAV brand equity is significantly associated with the components of CLV in expected and meaningful ways. For example, customer knowledge of a brand has an especially strong positive relationship with all three components of CLV. Notably, however, differentiation is a double-edged sword. While it is associated with higher customer profitability, it is also associated with lower acquisition and retention rates. The authors also find that marketing efforts exert indirect impacts on CLV through brand equity. Simulations show that changes in marketing, or exogenous changes in brand equity, can exert important effects on CLV. Overall, the findings suggest that the ?soft? and ?hard? sides of marketing need to be managed in a coordinated way. The authors conclude with a discussion of these and other implications for researchers and practitioners.",0
Measuring Consumer and Competitive Impact with Elasticity Decompositions,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Marketing investments are designed to change consumer behavior in ways that help goods compete in the marketplace. Previous research has focused on using elasticity decompositions to measure how these investments affect either consumer decision making or competing goods. On the one hand, decision-based decompositions attribute the growth in own-good demand to changes in the consumers? decision-making processes. On the other hand, unit-based and share-based decompositions attribute the same growth to either rivalrous or nonrivalrous sources. The objective of this article is to provide a clear and accurate method that simultaneously attributes the growth in own-good demand to changes in (1) consumers? decisions, (2) competitive demand, and (3) competitive market share. The author accomplishes this by settling some confusion about what the decision- and share-based decompositions mean, by discussing how each of the decompositions are related to the others, and by discussing the research questions that each of the decompositions can answer. From a managerial perspective, the author discusses how this method can be used to simplify and clarify the data needed for decision making.",1
"Global Versus Local Consumer Culture: Theory, Measurement, and Future Research Directions",Journal of International Marketing,2019,"The last few decades have seen the emergence of global consumer culture (GCC) as an important force in the marketplace. Yet, in recent years, powerful political and economic forces suggest that globalization might be stalling, leading to renewed interest in local consumer culture (LCC). This article provides an overview of where the field of international marketing stands on GCC and LCC, and it presents new empirical insights. It elaborates on the roots of GCC and LCC in consumer culture theory, cultural globalization theory, and acculturation theory. This background information sets the context for an in-depth discussion of how international marketers have operationalized consumer attitudes toward GCC and LCC, and their individual-level and national-cultural correlates. The article addresses behavioral and managerial consequences of GCC and LCC and concludes with areas for future research.",0
Global Brand Building and Management in the Digital Age,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"The rapid spread of the internet and internet-based technologies is reshaping how companies build and manage global brands. While specific platforms and technologies change rapidly, what does not change quickly are the underlying trends. This article identifies the implications of five core underlying digital trends for global brand building and management: (1) rise of digital global sales channels, (2) cocreation of global brand strategy, (3) global transparency of brand activities, (4) global connectivity among the brand?s consumers, and (5) the Internet of Things. For each trend, the author discusses key changes taking place in the marketplace and directions for future research.",0
A Global Investigation into the Constellation of Consumer Attitudes toward Global and Local Products,Journal of Marketing,2010,"In this article, the authors introduce attitude toward global products (AGP) and attitude toward local products (ALP) as generalized attitudinal constructs and address the four issues these constructs raise: (1) How are AGP and ALP related to each other? (2) What is the motivational structure underlying AGP and ALP? (3) Is the proposed theory culturally circumscribed, or does it generalize across countries? and (4) What are the managerially relevant implications of these consumer attitudes? To answer these questions, the authors propose and empirically test an integrated structure for AGP and ALP and their antecedents, organized around the powerful motivational concept of values. They test their theory using a unique data set involving 13,000 respondents from 28 countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, thus allowing for a global investigation of a global issue. The study findings provide managers with strategic direction on how to market their products in a globalized world.",0
Socially Desirable Response Tendencies in Survey Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Socially desirable responding (SDR) has been of long-standing interest to the field of marketing. Unfortunately, the construct has not always been well understood by marketing researchers. The authors provide a review of the SDR literature organized around three key issues?the conceptualization and measurement of SDR; the nomological constellation of personality traits, values, sociodemographics, and cultural factors associated with SDR; and the vexing issue of substance versus style in SDR measures. The authors review the current ?state of the literature,? identify unresolved issues, and provide new empirical evidence to assess the generalizability of existing knowledge, which is disproportionately based on U.S. student samples, to a global context. The new evidence is derived from a large international data set involving 12,424 respondents in 26 countries on four continents.",1
How Country Characteristics Affect the Perceived Value of Web Sites,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The authors examine how country characteristics systematically moderate the effects of individual-level drivers of the perceived value that consumers derive from visiting a brand manufacturer's Web site. They test hypotheses on data collected from 8886 consumers from 23 countries on three continents, involving 30 Web sites of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. They find that the effect of privacy/security protection on perceived value is stronger for people from countries with a weak rule of law, whereas people from countries that are high on national identity give more weight to whether there is cultural congruity between the site and themselves. People who live in more individualistic countries give more weight to pleasure, to privacy/security protection, and to customization in their perceived value judgments than people from collectivistic countries. The authors discuss implications for Web site design strategies.",0
"Stability and Change in Consumer Traits: Evidence from a 12-Year Longitudinal Study, 2002?2013",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This article examines the temporal dynamics in 11 consumer traits in a broad sample of 1,411 Dutch consumers followed for 12 years. The traits encompass consumer-specific expressions of all Big Five personality dimensions and map responses to the 4 Ps. The authors examine measurement stability and individual and population trajectories over time, as well as test?retest correlations, profile stability, and structural stability. They find that consumer traits are almost as stable as Big Five personality traits, even when measured with only a few items. Yet stability does not preclude change. The authors report notable trends that reflect the process of aging and/or changing attitudes in society over time. They disentangle both effects and find that society's changes in consumer traits are largely consistent with dynamic cultural theory. In paying special attention to the effects of the Great Recession, they find that price consciousness is most susceptible to changes in environmental conditions. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings conclude.",1
What Makes Consumers Willing to Pay a Price Premium for National Brands over Private Labels?,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The growing sales of private labels (PLs) pose significant challenges for national brands (NBs) around the world. A major question is whether consumers continue to be willing to pay a price premium for NBs over PLs. Using consumer survey data from 22,623 respondents from 23 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas across, on average, 63 consumer packaged goods categories per country, this article studies how marketing and manufacturing factors affect the price premium a consumer is willing to pay for an NB over a PL. These effects are mediated by consumer perceptions of the quality of NBs in relation to PLs. Although the results do not bode well for NBs in the sense that willingness to pay decreases as PLs mature, the authors offer several managerial recommendations to counter this trend. In countries in which PLs are more mature, the route to success is to go back to manufacturing basics. In PL development countries, there is a stronger role for marketing to enhance the willingness to pay for NBs.",1
Ethically Deployed Defaults: Transparency and Consumer Protection through Disclosure and Preference Articulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Defaults are extremely effective at covertly guiding choices, which raises concerns about how to employ them ethically and responsibly. Consumer advocates have proposed that disclosing how defaults are intended to influence choices could help protect consumers from being unknowingly manipulated. This research shows that consumers appreciate transparency, but disclosure does not make defaults less influential. Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative. Encouraging people to articulate their preferences for the default or its alternative, as in a forced choice, shifts the focus away from the default and reduces default effects.",1
The Effects of Traditional and Social Earned Media on Sales: A Study of a Microlending Marketplace,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Marketers distinguish three types of media: paid (e.g., advertising), owned (e.g., company website), and earned (e.g., publicity). The effects of paid media on sales have been extensively covered in the marketing literature. The effects of earned media, however, have received limited attention. The authors examine how two types of earned media, traditional (e.g., publicity and press mentions) and social (e.g., blog and online community posts), affect sales and activity in each other. They analyze 14 months of daily sales and media activity data from a microlending marketplace website using a multivariate autoregressive time-series model. They find that (1) both traditional and social earned media affect sales; (2) the per-event sales impact of traditional earned media activity is larger than for social earned media; (3) because of the greater frequency of social earned media activity, after adjusting for event frequency, social earned media's sales elasticity is significantly greater than traditional earned media's; and (4) social earned media appears to play an important role in driving traditional earned media activity.",1
Deriving Value from Social Commerce Networks,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Social commerce is an emerging trend in which sellers are connected in online social networks and sellers are individuals instead of firms. This article examines the economic value implications of a social network between sellers in a large online social commerce marketplace. In this marketplace, each seller creates his or her own shop, and network ties between sellers are directed hyperlinks between their shops. Three questions are addressed: (1) Does allowing sellers to connect to each other create value (i.e., increase sales)? (2) What are the mechanisms through which this value is created? and (3) How is this value distributed across sellers in the network and how does the position of a seller in the network (e.g., its centrality) influence how much he or she benefits or suffers from the network? The authors find that (1) allowing sellers to connect generates considerable economic value, (2) the network's value lies primarily in making shops more accessible to customers browsing the marketplace (the network creates a ?virtual shopping mall?), and (3) the sellers who benefit the most from the network are not necessarily those who are central to the network but rather those whose accessibility is most enhanced by the network.",1
Lower Connectivity is Better: The Effects of Network Structure on Redundancy of Ideas and Customer Innovativeness in Interdependent Ideation Tasks,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This article examines the popular marketing practice of interdependent ideation, whereby firms solicit ideas from customers through online platforms that enable customers to be exposed to or ?inspired? by other customers? ideas when generating their own. Although being exposed to others? ideas means that customers are ?connected? (at least implicitly) in a communication network that facilities the flow of ideas, the effect of network structure on individual innovativeness has not been considered in this context. The authors examine how, when, and why network structure?specifically, the clustering, or interconnectivity, of one's ?inspirations? (other customers)?affects the innovativeness of individual customers? product/service ideas in ideation tasks. Across five experiments, the authors show that (1) higher clustering/interconnectivity negatively affects the innovativeness of a customer's ideas; (2) this effect occurs because idea inspirations are more likely to be similar or redundant when their sources (i.e., other customers to which one is connected) are clustered; (3) greater redundancy among ideas used as inspirations is what causes lower innovativeness; and (4) this effect is attenuated when customers do not rely on other customers? ideas for inspiration.",1
Integrating Transfer Pricing Policy and Activity-Based Costing,Journal of International Marketing,2002,The activity-based costing approach justifies the transfer prices a multinational corporation uses to transfer unique company parts or services among its divisions located in different countries. This article illustrates how this approach reduces the probability of costly tax audits and assists in obtaining an advanced pricing agreement.,0
Exploring Cross-National Differences in Organizational Buyers? Normative Expectations of Supplier Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2010,"The authors analyze data from two cross-national studies to explore differences in organizational buyers? normative expectations of supplier performance. These normative expectations encompass what buyers perceive as business standards or norms, regardless of product/service, supplier, or industry. The first study (four countries) pinpoints the normative expectations that help explain why managers across countries may evaluate the same supplier performance differently. The second study provides an illustrative example of these differences in a separate sample drawn from the same four countries. The inclusion of such normative expectations of supplier performance has the potential to add explanatory power to models of performance evaluation in international business-to-business relationships. The findings suggest that if differences in normative expectations of supplier performance are not taken into account, performance ratings may be distorted indicators of actual performance.",0
"Spending on the Fly: Mental Budgets, Promotions, and Spending Behavior",Journal of Marketing,2010,"Recent research has suggested that consumers have in-store slack for grocery trips?that is, they leave room in their mental budgets to make unplanned purchases. Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded. The authors discuss implications for shopper marketing strategies.",0
Strategic Export Pricing: A Long and Winding Road,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"?Pricing is the moment of truth.? This phrase is especially valid for international pricing. As most markets reach saturation, communication technologies such as the Internet lead to more transparency, retail price maintenance disappears, and product life cycles become shorter, firms will find it increasingly difficult to establish and maintain price differences across markets. Given their power, pricing issues have attracted little research interest compared with other marketing tools. The author aims to shed more light on the process of industrial exporters? international pricing practices. On the basis of a series of 45 qualitative interviews with seasoned international business executives from five different industries, the author describes common ?best practices.? Along with insights gained from the available literature, these linkages are tied to a conceptual framework. As the information comes from experienced, internationally active firms from a European Union country, findings are indicative for other European Union countries.",0
Stockpiling Points in Linear Loyalty Programs,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Customers often stockpile reward points in linear loyalty programs (i.e., programs that do not explicitly reward stockpiling) despite several economic incentives against it (e.g., the time value of money). The authors develop a mathematical model of redemption choice that unites three explanations for why customers seem to be motivated to stockpile on their own, even though the retailer does not reward them for doing so. These motivations are economic (the value of forgone points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological (customers value points differently than cash). The authors capture the psychological motivation by allowing customers to book cash and point transactions in separate mental accounts. They estimate the model on data from an international retailer using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and accurately forecast redemptions during an 11-month out-of-sample period. The results indicate substantial heterogeneity in how customers are motivated to redeem and suggest that the behavior in the data is driven mostly by cognitive and psychological incentives.",1
"Once Burned, Twice Shy: How Naive Learning, Counterfactuals, and Regret Affect the Repurchase of Stocks Previously Sold",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Investors? previous experiences with a stock affect their willingness to repurchase that stock. Using detailed trade data from two brokers, the authors document that investors are reluctant to repurchase stocks previously sold for a loss and stocks that have risen in price subsequent to a prior sale. The authors propose that this behavior reflects investors? emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment, regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in negative emotions.",1
Strategic Bundling of Products and Prices: A New Synthesis for Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Bundling is pervasive in today's markets. However, the bundling literature contains inconsistencies in the use of terms and ambiguity about basic principles underlying the phenomenon. The literature also lacks an encompassing classification of the various strategies, clear rules to evaluate the legality of each strategy, and a unifying framework to indicate when each is optimal. Based on a review of the marketing, economics, and law literature, this article develops a new synthesis of the field of bundling, which provides three important benefits. First, the article clearly and consistently defines bundling terms and identifies two key dimensions that enable a comprehensive classification of bundling strategies. Second, it formulates clear rules for evaluating the legality of each of these strategies. Third, it proposes a framework of 12 propositions that suggest which bundling strategy is optimal in various contexts. The synthesis provides managers with a framework with which to understand and choose bundling strategies. It also provides researchers with promising avenues for further research.",0
Indirect Network Effects in New Product Growth,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Indirect network effects are of prime interest to marketers because they affect the growth and takeoff of software availability for and hardware sales of a new product. Although prior work on indirect network effects in the economics and marketing literature is valuable, there are two main shortcomings. First, empirical analysis of indirect network effects is rare. Second, in contrast to the importance prior literature credits to the ?chicken-and-egg? paradox in these markets, the temporal pattern (i.e., Which leads to which?) of indirect network effects remains unstudied. Based on empirical evidence of nine markets, this study shows that (1) indirect network effects, as commonly operationalized by prior literature, are weaker than expected from prior literature and (2) in most markets examined, hardware sales ?lead? software availability, whereas the reverse almost never happens, contrary to existing beliefs. These findings are supported by multiple methods, such as takeoff and time-series analyses, and fit with the histories of the markets studied herein. For academia, the study identifies a need for new and more relevant conceptualizations of indirect network effects. For public policy, it questions the need for intervention in network markets. For management practice, it downplays the importance of the availability of a large library of software for hardware technology to be successful.",0
Marketing of the Life Sciences: A New Framework and Research Agenda for a Nascent Field,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Although marketing scholars often seek to contribute new knowledge that is applicable across industries, some industries have unique characteristics that require industry-specific knowledge development. The authors argue that this requirement applies to the life sciences industry, defined as companies in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and therapeutic medical devices. Marketers in the life sciences industry face novel and unique challenges along eight decision areas in therapy creation, therapy launch, and therapy promotion. In therapy creation, they face therapy pipeline optimization, innovation alliance formation, and therapy positioning decisions. In therapy launch, they face global market entry timing and key opinion leader selection decisions. Therapy promotion mostly revolves around sales force management, communication management, and stimulating patient compliance. The authors qualify these decision areas according to their practical importance and academic potential. The article derives preliminary generalizations and propositions from prior research and practice and steers further research in specific directions. The authors believe that marketing of the life sciences offers a fertile area for further research because, among other things, its potential impact transcends any problems typically investigated by marketing scholars.",0
The Quest for Citations: Drivers of Article Impact,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Why do some articles become building blocks for future scholars, whereas others remain unnoticed? The authors aim to answer this question by contrasting, synthesizing, and simultaneously testing three scientometric perspectives?universalism, social constructivism, and presentation?on the influence of article and author characteristics on article citations. They study all articles published in a sample of five major journals in marketing from 1990 to 2002 that are central to the discipline. They count the number of citations each of these articles has received and regress this count on an extensive set of characteristics of the article (i.e., article quality, article domain, title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity) and the author (i.e., author visibility and author personal promotion). They find that the number of citations an article in the marketing discipline receives depends more on ?what is said? (quality and domain) and ?who says it? (author visibility and personal promotion) than on ?how it is said? (title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity). The insights gleaned from this analysis contribute to the marketing literature and are relevant to scientific stakeholders, such as the management of scientific journals and individual academic scholars, as they strive to maximize citations. They are also relevant to marketing practitioners; they inform practitioners on characteristics of the academic journals in marketing and their relevance to decisions they face. Conversely, the insights also raise challenges regarding how to make journals accessible and relevant to marketing practitioners: (1) Authors visible to academics are not necessarily visible to practitioners; (2) the readability of an article may hurt academic credibility and impact, but it may be instrumental in influencing practitioners; and (3) it remains questionable whether articles that academics assess to be of high quality are also managerially relevant.",0
Buying Modular Systems in Technology-Intensive Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Technology-intensive markets consist of products that are often interdependent and operate together as a modular system. Although prior research has extensively addressed standardization and network externalities in such markets, it has not addressed the buying of modular systems. The authors identify two focal decision dimensions of the buyer, namely the decision of whether to outsource system integration and the decision of how much to concentrate the purchase of system components with one or more suppliers. The authors develop a comprehensive production- and transaction-cost framework to explain companies' positions on these two decisions. They find that especially leakage and the buyer's know-how, together with the technological volatility the buyer faces, drive the preference for outsourcing system integration and the purchase concentration of system components. An empirical test in the market for telecommunications systems supports the theory developed.",1
Drivers of Local Relative to Global Brand Purchases: A Contingency Approach,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Consumers around the world are choosing between local versus global brands in the marketplace. The authors draw on the dual-drivers theory of consumer choice and global consumer culture theory to offer a sociocultural-historical perspective on purchases of local (relative to global) brands. Their framework focuses on two local?global consumer values (ethnocentrism and global connectedness) and the identity- and quality-signaling functions of local (relative to global) brands. The authors argue for a contingency approach such that the effects of these local?global consumer values are moderated by country level of economic development and product category symbolism. This research uses consumer-level data (n = 2,197) and country-level data (from Euromonitor's Global Market Information Database) from seven countries (Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States). They find that purchases of local (relative to global) brands are predicated on local?global consumer values, mediated by perceptions of the identity function of local (relative to global) brands, and moderated by the country's level of economic development and product category symbolism.",0
Spatial Distance Construal Perspectives on Cause-Related Marketing: The Importance of Nationalism in Russia,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Consumers around the globe expect firms to contribute to environmentally and socially responsible causes. Using construal level theory with a spatial distance lens, we examine effects of spatial proximity of the firm (domestic firm vs. foreign multinational corporation [MNC]), cause (domestic vs. global), and consumer cultural identity (locally oriented: nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism; distantly oriented: global identity and global citizenship through global brands) on consumer attitudes toward the firm. Across three studies with a focus on Russia and environmental causes, we consistently find that nationalism moderates consumer attitudes, whereas consumer ethnocentrism, global identity, and global citizenship through global brands do not. When firms engage in cause-related marketing and focus on proximal causes, nationalistic consumers are more favorable toward domestic firms (vs. foreign MNCs). When firms are not engaged in cause-related marketing, consumers with stronger nationalism are more favorable toward domestic firms, and consumers with weaker nationalism are more favorable toward foreign MNCs. Importantly, the effects of nationalism are mitigated when foreign MNCs and domestic firms engage with global causes. Product involvement, environmental concerns, and marketplace skepticism are predictors of attitudes toward the firm. The results highlight the importance of considering the socio-historical-political context of a given country and locally oriented nationalistic beliefs.",0
Branded Products as a Passport to Global Citizenship: Perspectives from Developed and Developing Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"This article focuses on belief in brands as a passport to global citizenship, defined as a person's perception that global brands create an imagined global identity. The authors assess the effects of this belief on the importance consumers assign to branded products and also examine the antecedent effects of cultural openness and consumer ethnocentrism. Their work focuses on the global youth market in the developing countries of Romania, Ukraine, and Russia and the developed U.S. market. The findings contribute to a broadened understanding of branding in a global marketplace by examining the associations between beliefs about global brands and the importance consumers attach to branded products in their daily lives.",0
Export Performance Measures in Australia and the United Kingdom,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"In this study, the export performance scale developed by Cavusgil and Zou (1994) is refined and tested for cross-cultural validity in Australia and the United Kingdom. The aim is to encourage a more integrated approach to export performance measurement so that valid comparisons of international research can be made and export theory advanced. Two key steps are reported. First, the scale was refined through exploratory research. Then, data were collected from a sample of 434 exporters in Australia and the United Kingdom. Based on the procedures suggested by Singh (1995) and Mullen (1995), factorial similarity, factorial equivalence, and measurement equivalence is tested across the two national samples. Although support is found for factorial similarity and equivalence, the results do not support full measurement equivalence. It is therefore recommended that some caution be exercised when comparing research conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom, which uses this scale. Suggestions for further research are also made.",0
Executive Insights: Relationship Formation in International Joint Ventures: Insights from Australian?Malaysian International Joint Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Many international joint ventures are unsuccessful, and managers partly blame the ?softer? issues related to partner relationships. The authors study these relational (behavioral) aspects of the formation process using seven international joint ventures involving Australian and Malaysian firms. During the five stages of formation (i.e., need determination, partner search, partner selection, negotiations, and operations), four dimensions of trust (i.e., personal, competence, contractual, and goodwill) and three dimensions of commitment (i.e., intentions based, contractual, and affective) play prominent roles. Managers need to focus on these dimensions during the five stages of formation to improve chances of success.",0
Executive Insights: Exporting Services to Southeast Asia: Lessons from Australian Knowledge-Based Service Exporters,Journal of International Marketing,2005,"Despite the growing importance of service exports in the world economy, there is limited research into the unique success factors in this sector. This article reports the key lessons from 17 Australian exporters of knowledge-based services (e.g., market research, legal, advertising, engineering) that conduct business in Southeast Asia. The authors selected the cases in accordance with Patterson and Cicic's (1995) classification scheme, which recognizes key differences across service types. Analysis of the data shows that though there are some common success factors across service types, services characterized by high tangibility on the one hand and low tangibility on the other hand derived additional success factors on the basis of their tangible and intangible assets, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of firms with high face-to-face contact during service manufacturing and delivery was enhanced by personnel-related factors. This suggests a ?contingency guide? to knowledge-based service exports.",0
A Temporal Dynamic Model of Spousal Family Purchase-Decision Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"The authors examine family purchase-decision dynamics to shed light on enhancing marketing communication effectiveness. In particular, the authors are interested in understanding the temporal nature of spousal behavioral interaction in family decision making to help marketers target communication messages, shape brand choice, and guide personal selling activities. The authors calibrate a dynamic simultaneous equations model to investigate spousal family purchase-decision behavior: What are spousal behavioral interactions in a discrete purchase decision, and what are the temporal aspects of spousal decision behavior across decisions? The results indicate that spouses tend both not to reciprocate coercion in a discrete decision and to adjust influence strategies over time. The authors also investigate the effectiveness of influence strategies and spousal satisfaction with decisions and their impacts on spousal subsequent decision behaviors from a postdecision perspective as a mechanism to explain why spouses revise decision behaviors across purchase decisions. The authors discuss marketing implications of their findings and present ideas about how to use these findings creatively to target advertising and sales messages to influential spouses in specific decision contexts.",1
Do Slotting Allowances Enhance Efficiency or Hinder Competition?,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Slotting allowances are lump-sum payments by manufacturers to retailers for stocking new products. The economic rationale for slotting allowances is controversial. Supporters argue that slotting allowances are efficiency enhancing; critics argue that they are anticompetitive. However, there is no empirical research on this issue because of the difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all new products that were offered to one retailer for a period of nine months, the authors empirically investigate support for the alternative rationales for slotting allowances. The analysis indicates that, in general, there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the anticompetitive theories. The authors find that slotting allowances (1) efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space, (2) help balance the risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers, (3) help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of new products, and (4) widen retail distribution for manufacturers by mitigating retail competition. The authors find little support for the anticompetitive rationales in the data. The empirical support for the efficiency rationales suggests that the Federal Trade Commission was correct in being circumspect about banning slotting allowances outright.",1
The Moderating Effect of Buying Impulsivity on the Dynamics of Unplanned Purchasing Motivations,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Previous studies of in-store decision making have assumed that motivations for unplanned purchases are homogeneous throughout a shopping trip. In response to this assumption, the authors develop a conceptual framework to explain how consumers? internal (i.e., intrinsic) and external (i.e., extrinsic) motivations for unplanned purchases actually vary during a shopping trip. Two field studies and five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially focuses on internal motivations (e.g., ?because I love it?) or external motivations (e.g., ?because it is on sale?) for unplanned purchases at the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned purchases and consumers? relative spending on unplanned purchases. Overall, these findings address conflicting results in previous shopping studies, advance the literature streams on consumer motivation and sequential choice, and contribute insights to enhance shopper-marketing programs.",1
The Influence of Price Presentation Order on Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Existing theory and prior research suggest that consumers perceive purchase prices more/less favorably when they are preceded by higher/lower prices. However, to date, researchers have found these effects in contexts in which the product, and thus perceived quality, is held constant. Given that consumers commonly believe price and quality are positively correlated and that price?quality perceptions have been shown to influence price evaluations and willingness to pay, the generalizability of existing research to commonly encountered contexts is questionable. In this research, the authors examine the influence of price order on consumer choice across differing brands in contexts in which consumer quality perceptions are free to covary with price and they are manipulated to be correlated or uncorrelated with price. Using reference dependence theory as a framework, they find that when differing brand options are presented in descending price order, consumers tend to choose higher-price options; when they are presented in ascending price order, consumers tend to choose lower-priced options (the price order effect). In addition, the authors show that consumers' price?quality perceptions are a necessary condition for this effect.",1
The Effect of Reference Point Diagnosticity on Attractiveness and Intentions Ratings,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Researchers have long been interested in understanding cognitive processing differences across consumer judgments and choices. Although it represents a focal outcome in much research, less attention has focused on the ?choice-like? response of behavioral intentions. This research compares processing differences in the formulation of judgments of attractiveness and intentions. On the basis of the premise that different goals underlie these responses, the authors hypothesize that alternative reference points result from differential reference point diagnosticity. The authors test this prediction in the domain of price attractiveness and purchase intentions ratings. Study 1 provides evidence that endpoints of the range of alternative prices are more predictive of ratings of price attractiveness than of purchase intentions, while price rank and distribution mean are more predictive of purchase intentions ratings than of price attractiveness ratings. Study 2 replicates this effect using a different methodology. Finally, Study 3 provides a test of the external validity of these findings in a multicue setting.",1
Measuring the Impact of Promotions on Brand Switching When Consumers Are Forward Looking,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Logit choice models have been used extensively to study promotion response. This article examines whether brand-switching elasticities derived from these models are overestimated as a result of rational consumer adjustment of purchase timing to coincide with promotion schedules and whether a dynamic structural model can address this bias. Using simulated data, the authors first show that if the structural model is correct, brand-switching elasticities are overestimated by stand-alone logit models. A nested logit model improves the estimates, but not completely. Second, the authors estimate the models on real data. The results indicate that the structural model fits better and produces sensible coefficient estimates. The authors then observe the same pattern in switching elasticities as they do in the simulation. Third, the authors predict sales assuming a 50% increase in promotion frequency. The reduced-form models predict much higher sales levels than does the dynamic structural model. The authors conclude that reduced-form model estimates of brand-switching elasticities can be overstated and that a dynamic structural model is best for addressing the problem. Reduced-form models that include incidence can partially, though not completely, address the issue. The authors discuss the implications for researchers and managers.",1
Learning and Acting on Customer Information: A Simulation-Based Demonstration on Service Allocations with Offshore Centers,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"As service centers become crucial corporate assets for increasing customer relationships and profits, it is imperative to understand customer reactions to service allocations. Using customer call history from a DSL service, the authors empirically investigate how customers? onshore and offshore experiences affect service duration and customer retention. They formulate service channel allocation decisions as solutions to a dynamic programming problem in which the firm learns about heterogeneous customer preferences, balances short-term service costs with long-term customer retention, and optimally matches customers with their preferred centers to maximize long-term profit. They demonstrate through simulations that learning enables a firm to make more customized allocations and that acting on long-term customer responses prompts the firm to make proactive decisions that prevent customers from leaving. As a result, the firm can improve customer retention and profit. The proposed framework also mirrors the recent trend of companies seeking solutions that transform customer information into customized and dynamic marketing decisions to improve long-term profit.",1
Intention?Behavior Discrepancy of Foreign versus Domestic Brands in Emerging Markets: The Relevance of Consumer Prior Knowledge,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Most research on the performance of foreign versus domestic brands in emerging markets has examined dependent measures of product evaluation or purchase intention. However, consumers who intend to buy a product may switch to competing brands, thus displaying an intention?behavior discrepancy (IBD). Drawing on literature on country associations and dual process theory, the authors examine the performance of foreign versus domestic brands on IBD in emerging markets and the moderating role of consumer prior knowledge. They conduct an intention survey followed by a postpurchase survey in the Chinese automobile and smartphone industries and find that foreign brands have an advantage on IBD relative to domestic brands, indicating that they have the dual advantage of higher evaluations and lower IBDs. Furthermore, foreign brands? advantage on IBD is smaller for consumers with inaccurate prior knowledge because they are more likely to systematically reprocess information and discount foreign brands? favorable country associations. For these consumers, overestimating the product reduces foreign brands? advantage to a lesser degree than underestimating it as a result of confirmation bias. These findings provide implications for brands in emerging markets.",0
The Effect of Recycling versus Trashing on Consumption: Theory and Experimental Evidence,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could reduce consumers? negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers? positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of consumers? disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns.",1
Enhancing Innovation through International Joint Venture Portfolios: From the Emerging Firm Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Anecdotal evidence continues to suggest that many firms in emerging economies (EEs) lack innovation. To investigate how these firms might improve their innovation, the authors integrate resource dependence theory with network theory and the resource-based view to theorize that EE firms can advance their innovation by configuring their international joint venture (IJV) portfolio characteristics at the network and focal firm levels. The results indicate that an EE firm's innovation improves when structural hole positions in its IJV portfolio increase but decreases when network centrality increases. Such relationships are further contingent on two focal firm-level IJV portfolio characteristics: IJV portfolio size and IJV portfolio resource commitment.",0
Place the Logo High or Low? Using Conceptual Metaphors of Power in Packaging Design,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Across three studies, this research examines how marketers can capitalize on their brand's standing in the marketplace through strategic logo placement on their packaging. Using a conceptual metaphor framework, the authors find that consumers prefer powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured high rather than low on the brand's packaging, whereas they prefer less powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured low rather than high on the brand's packaging. Furthermore, the authors confirm that the underlying mechanism for this shift in preference is a fluency effect derived from consumers intuitively linking the concept of power with height. Given this finding, the authors then demonstrate an important boundary condition by varying a person's state of power to be at odds with the metaphoric link. The results demonstrate when and how marketers can capitalize on consumers? latent associations through package design.",0
"What Drives Herding Behavior in Online Ratings? The Role of Rater Experience, Product Portfolio, and Diverging Opinions",Journal of Marketing,2019,"Consumers? postpurchase evaluations have received much attention due to the strong link between ratings and sales. However, less is known about how herding effects from reference groups (i.e., crowd and friends) unfold in online ratings. This research examines the role of divergent opinions, rater experience, and firm product portfolio in attenuating/amplifying herding influences in online rating environments. Applying robust econometric techniques on data from a community of board gamers, we find that herding effects are significant and recommend a more nuanced view of herding. Highlighting the role of rater experience, the positive influence of the crowd is weakened and friend influences are amplified as the rater gains experience. Furthermore, divergent opinions between reference groups create herding and differentiation depending on the reference group and the rater?s experience level. Finally, firms can influence online opinion through their product portfolio in profound ways. A broad and deep product portfolio not only leads to favorable quality inferences but also attenuates social influence. Implications for online reputation management, rating system design, and firm product strategy are discussed.",0
Why Do Salespeople Quit? An Empirical Examination of Own and Peer Effects on Salesperson Turnover Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Salesperson turnover can have a negative overall effect on a firm. Research on salesperson turnover has conceptually studied the consequences of voluntary turnover on a firm. However, little empirical research has investigated the antecedents of salesperson turnover?specifically, the role of own effects (relative performance, customer satisfaction, and goal realization) and peer effects (peer performance variance and turnover). Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This research has implications for sales force management because it helps managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent salesperson turnover.",1
Measuring the Lifetime Value of a Customer in the Consumer Packaged Goods Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"In this study, the authors propose a flexible framework to assess customer lifetime value (CLV) in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) context. They address the substantive and modeling challenges that arise in this setting, namely, (1) multiple discreteness, (2) brand switching, and (3) budget-constrained consumption. Using a Bayesian estimation, the authors are also able to infer the consumer's latent budgetary constraint using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to understand the customer's budgetary constraint without having to survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and conventional CLV approaches. Finally, they conduct two policy simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV, as well as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting, and develop managerial insights in this context.",1
Knowing When to Spend: Unintended Financial Consequences of Earmarking to Encourage Savings,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Maintaining savings is an important financial goal. Yet there are times when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest rate credit option varies as a function of the savings? intended use. Paradoxically, people are most likely to turn to high interest rate credit with the belief that doing so is the responsible option.",1
Axe the Tax: Taxes are Disliked More than Equivalent Costs,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Tax collection is critical for the proper functioning of society. However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and affects behavior in coun-ternormative ways. They demonstrate the phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger preference to avoid tax-related costs than to avoid equal-sized (or larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases, financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who identify with ?antitax? parties to consider positive uses of their tax payments mitigates tax aversion. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for consumer behavior research and tax policies.",1
Assessing Three Sources of Misresponse to Reversed Likert Items,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Data collected through multi-item Likert scales that contain reversed items often exhibit problems, such as unexpected factor structures and diminished scale reliabilities. These problems arise when respondents select responses on the same side of the scale neutral point for both reversed and nonreversed items, a phenomenon the authors call ?misresponse.? Across four experiments and an exploratory study using published data, the authors find that misresponse to reversed Likert items averaged approximately 20%, twice the level identified as problematic in previous simulation studies. Counter to prevailing thought, the patterns of misresponse and response latency across manipulated items could not be attributed to respondent inattention or acquiescence. Instead, the pattern supports an item verification difficulty explanation, which holds that task complexity, and thus misresponse and response latency, increases with the number of cognitive operations required for a respondent to compare a scale item with his or her belief. The observed results are well explained by the constituent comparison model.",1
Modeling Simultaneous Multiple Goal Pursuit and Adaptation in Consumer Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Goals are constructs that direct choice behavior by guiding a decision maker toward desirable (or away from undesirable) end states. Often, consumers are motivated to satisfy multiple goals within a single choice. Although previous research has recognized this possibility, it has not directly formulated models of choice as a multigoal problem. The authors develop such a model, referred to as the multiple-goal-based choice model, which incorporates (1) simultaneous multiple goal pursuit and (2) context-driven goal adaptation but (3) does not require a priori identification of the number or nature of the goals. Goal adaptation within a single choice instance, allied to repeated choices, is the key to empirical identification of multiple latent goals. The proposed model is tested and supported using discrete choice experimental data on digital cameras through multiple validation exercises. The model can lead to significantly different policy implications with regard to consumers? valuation for new product designs, compared with extant utility-based choice models.",1
The Effects of Temporal Consistency of Sales Promotions and Availability on Consumer Choice Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"The importance of consistency of the marketing mix is widely regarded as a key marketing principle. Consistency is commonly understood to apply among marketing mix elements, but it also involves a temporal dimension: Marketing messages and, more generally, marketing mix strategies should achieve some degree of consistency over time. In this article, the authors focus on a particular aspect of marketing mix consistency over time in the context of frequently purchased packaged consumer goods: They investigate the impact of temporal consistency on store promotions, as well as the availability of the product on the shelf, on consumer product evaluations (utilities) and choices. In this specific context, temporal (in)consistency captures the degree of variability of prices, displays, and features, as well as availability over time, for a stockkeeping unit. The authors find that sales promotion mix consistency over time affects both consumer utility mean and scale and thus consumers? choices and brand shares. Lack of sales promotion mix consistency is generally deleterious to consumer brand evaluations through (1) decreases to average valuations and (2) decreases in scale, both of which can lead to decreases in market share.",1
Capturing Context-Sensitive Information Usage in Choice Models via Mixtures of Information Archetypes,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors offer a new conceptualization and operational model of consumer choice that allows context-sensitive information usage and preference heterogeneity to be separately and simultaneously captured, thus transforming the axiom of full information use into a testable hypothesis. A key contribution of the proposed framework is the integration of two previously disjointed and often antagonistic research paradigms: (1) the economic rationality perspective, which assumes stable preferences and full information usage, and (2) the psychological bounded-rationality perspective, which allows context-sensitive preferences and information selectivity. The authors demonstrate that the two paradigms can and do coexist in the same decision-making space, even at the level of individual consumer choices. The proposed information archetype mixture model is tested in four studies that span different product categories and levels of task complexity. The findings have ramifications for choice modeling theory and implementation, beyond the disciplinary boundaries of marketing to applied economics and choice-focused social sciences.",1
The Impact of Brand Extension Introduction on Choice,Journal of Marketing,2001,"This article focuses on the impact of a new brand extension introduction on choice in a behavioral context using national household scanner data involving multiple brand extensions. Particularly, the authors investigate the reciprocal impact of trial of successful and unsuccessful brand extensions on parent brand choice. In addition, the authors examine the effects of experience with the parent brand on consumers? trial and repeat of a brand extension using household scanner data on six brand extensions from a national panel. In the case of successful brand extensions, the results show positive reciprocal effects of extension trial on parent brand choice, particularly among prior non-users of the parent brand, and consequently on market share. The authors find evidence for potential negative reciprocal effects of unsuccessful extensions. In addition, the study shows that experience with the parent brand has a significant impact on extension trial, but not on extension repeat.",0
"Marketing Alliances, Firm Networks, and Firm Value Creation",Journal of Marketing,2009,"Prior research has found that the announcement of marketing alliances tends to produce no effect on firm value creation in a high-tech context. This article reexamines this issue and investigates whether the characteristics of a firm's network of alliances affect the firm value created from the announcement of a new marketing alliance. The authors investigate whether network centrality, network density, network efficiency, network reputation, and marketing alliance capability influence firm value creation. They examine this question using an event study of 230 announcements for marketing alliances in the software industry. The results indicate that, in general, marketing alliance announcements create value (i.e., abnormal stock returns) for the firm in the announcement period event window. Furthermore, network efficiency and network density have the strongest positive impact when they are moderate; network reputation and network centrality have no effect. These results point to the greater role of relational network characteristics than size-/status-based benefits. Finally, marketing alliance capability, which reflects a firm's ability to manage a network of previous marketing alliances, has a positive impact on value creation.",0
Value Creation following Merger and Acquisition Announcements: The Role of Strategic Emphasis Alignment,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"The purpose of this article is to investigate how strategic emphases of merging firms (marketing or research and development) create value in a merger context. The authors suggest that strategic emphasis alignment?the extent to which the resource configurations of acquirer and target firms are similar to or distinct from one another?is a key construct that facilitates value creation. Using data on abnormal stock returns, the authors also suggest that when merging firms have low strategic emphasis alignment, value is enhanced when the merger motive is diversification. In contrast, when merging firms have high strategic emphasis alignment, value is enhanced when the merger motive is consolidation.",1
Branding in a Hyperconnected World: Refocusing Theories and Rethinking Boundaries,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world, requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.",0
Transferring the Retail Format Successfully into Foreign Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Research shows that most retailers expand abroad by transferring some elements of their format, and therefore their value chain, unchanged, while adapting other elements. However, little is known about how strongly a retail format's standardized or adapted elements affect performance in a foreign country. To shed light on this issue, this study focuses on the design of important processes and offerings, as both determine retailers? efficiency and sales. This study proposes that successful retailers build on the unchanged know-how parts of the format by combining more standardized core elements with adapted peripheral elements. The authors draw from a survey of 102 international retailers and interviews with 126 executives conducted at their headquarters. The results show that retailers transfer offers (marketing programs) and processes (marketing and supply chain) differently and hierarchically; that is, peripheral elements are allowed to vary, whereas core elements are transferred in a more standardized manner. Furthermore, the relationship between marketing program elements and performance varies: the use of standardized core elements (e.g., store types, locations) and adapted peripheral elements (e.g., assortments, promotions) is advisable for increasing performance in another country. Processes are only indirectly associated with performance. These observations hold true for both psychically close and distant countries.",0
"Does Being Perceived as Global Pay Off? An Analysis of Leading Foreign and Domestic Multinational Corporations in India, Japan, and the United States",Journal of International Marketing,2016,"As global players, multinational product and corporate brands are known to have an advantage over local competitors. Although foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) increasingly compete against domestic MNCs, particularly in economically strong countries, little is known about (1) whether foreign MNCs can use their globalness to their advantage and (2) how the perceptions of foreign versus domestic MNCs drive consumer behavior. To examine this issue, the authors propose a framework based on accessibility-diagnosticity theory and test it using consumer data from countries in which leading foreign and domestic MNCs compete. The results show that perceived brand globalness enhances consumers? intentional loyalty toward MNCs indirectly by affecting the functional and psychological value these MNCs offer. The value-creation routes change according to firms? origins?that is, foreign MNCs translate globalness through functional and psychological value, while domestic MNCs translate globalness through psychological value. However, the benefits of being global and the value-creation routes for foreign (vs. domestic) MNCs differ between countries. Finally, high consumer ethnocentrism weakens?but does not completely erase?the effects of perceived brand globalness in all countries and interacts with MNCs? origins.",0
"The Effects of Perceived Brand Globalness and Perceived Brand Localness in China: Empirical Evidence on Western, Asian, and Domestic Retailers",Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Internationalizing retailers have shifted their attention to developing countries in which they pursue different forms of adapted-format transfer strategies to succeed locally. However, little is known about whether such retailers can use their core advantage of a global retail brand and how consumer perceptions of such global retail brands drive retail patronage. To expand knowledge on this issue, the authors use data from 1188 Chinese consumer surveys on 36 Western, Asian, and mainland Chinese retailers. They find that retailers? perceived brand globalness and perceived brand localness enhance retail patronage only by affecting consumers? functional and psychological values. These value creation routes to success change according to retailers? origins. Although Western and Asian retailers draw equally strong benefits from their global perceptions, Asian retailers convince consumers predominantly through functional values, whereas Western retailers also influence consumers emotionally. Chinese retailers gain consumers by being perceived as ?glocal? brands. Furthermore, perceived brand globalness enhances retail patronage most strongly for global identity consumers. Thus, retailers in emerging countries benefit from perceived brand globalness depending on retailer- and consumer-specific boundary conditions.",0
Can Sales Uncertainty Increase Firm Profits?,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The authors add to the sales management literature in three ways. First, they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty. This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal?agent models that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse. Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary to the standard principal?agent model. Third, they provide intuition for this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random. When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random demand. When the customers? response to effort (or price) is random, the decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to agents? risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case, higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard principal?agent models.",1
Consumption-Based Cross-Brand Learning: Are Private Labels Really Private?,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"While some researchers view private labels (PLs) as a key tool for retailer differentiation, others imply that consumers do not distinguish between PLs of different chains. This debate raises the question: Do a retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does this affect their choice share vis--vis national brands? The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative to national brands. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications.",1
Stock Market Reactions to New Product Launches in International Markets: The Moderating Role of Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Prior research indicates the importance of new product launches across international markets for firm performance. However, little is known about if, and how, new product launches in international markets drive firm financial value. This study examines the drivers of stock market reactions to a new product introduction in a foreign country, along with the moderating impact of cultural context. Using a sample of 1,154 products in 34 product categories launched in 48 countries between 2011 and 2018, the authors investigate how product characteristics such as product innovativeness and product type affect abnormal stock reactions to a new product launch event. Furthermore, the authors assess the role of the national culture by considering the individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence characteristics of the country where the new product is launched. Results of a mixed-effects estimation model indicate that product launches in international markets with innovativeness and hedonism characteristics positively affect firm value. The effects of culture are complex and multifarious, providing valuable insights regarding the impact of new product introductions in global markets on firm value.",0
Global Brand Architecture Position and Market-Based Performance: The Moderating Role of Culture,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Companies expend vast resources to create product and brand portfolios in the global marketplace. Yet knowledge of the market-based performance implications of various positions in a firm's portfolio architecture is lacking in the literature. To further the understanding of managing brands in the global marketplace, the authors develop a conceptual framework based on the tenets of signaling theory, explore the relationship between global brand architecture and market-based performance, and consider how culture moderates this relationship. The results of the analyses, from a panel data set of 165 automotive brands operating in 65 countries from 2002 to 2008, reveal that global brands perform better in the marketplace than their nonglobal counterparts. Cultural values indeed provide boundary conditions for this relationship, suggesting that alternative strategies for some markets may be advisable.",0
To Buy or Not to Buy: Consumers? Demand Response Patterns for Healthy versus Unhealthy Food,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The authors integrate research on impulsivity from the psychology area with standard economic theories of consumer demand to make novel predictions about the effects of market price changes on consumers? food consumption behavior. The results from multiple studies confirm that consumers exhibit undesirable asymmetric patterns of demand sensitivity to price changes for healthy and unhealthy food. For healthy food, demand sensitivity is greater for a price increase than for a price decrease. For unhealthy food, the opposite holds true. The research further shows that the undesirable patterns are attenuated or magnified for key policy-relevant factors that have been shown to decrease or increase impulsive purchase behavior, respectively. As the rising obesity trend brings American consumers? food consumption behavior under increased scrutiny, the focal findings hold significant implications for both public policy makers and food marketers.",0
Research on Export Pricing: Still Moving toward Maturity,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"Over the past four decades, there has been a considerable number of studies that have examined the determinants and outcomes of export pricing. However, despite this large volume of studies, the knowledge of the determinants and consequences of export pricing is characterized by a fragmented, diverse, and inconsistent collection of findings that hinders scholarship and practical advancement in the field. A major reason for this absence of clear insights is the lack of synthesis and assimilation of the fragmented knowledge. To address this gap in the literature, the authors review and evaluate 98 articles published between 1971 and 2010. The results indicate that although significant progress has been made in recent years, research on export pricing is still characterized by the lack of a strong theoretical basis, the failure to agree on the relevant determinants of export pricing, and some weakness in research designs and analytical techniques, which may explain the many contradictory and confusing findings in the literature. On the basis of these findings, the authors discuss several implications, and consider directions for further research.",0
Mine your Customers or Mine your Business: The Moderating Role of Culture in Online Word-of-Mouth Reviews,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Consumer- and producer-generated content on the Internet has become an important source of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for buyers making purchasing decisions. However, the cultural effect of eWOM on firm performance remains largely unexplored. This research contributes to the extant marketing literature by examining the moderating role of culture in the relationship between eWOM and product-market performance. The author finds that individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance tempered the effect of eWOM on market share. In particular, the impact of press releases and negative reviews has been overrated. The findings suggest that effective online international marketing strategies should take into account local market values, country-of-origin effects, and product competition.",0
Is Neutral Really Neutral? The Effects of Neutral User-Generated Content on Product Sales,Journal of Marketing,2014,"This article aims to specify the performance implications of neutral user-generated content (UGC) on product sales by differentiating mixed-neutral UGC, which contains an equal amount of positive and negative claims, from indifferent-neutral UGC, which includes neither positive nor negative claims. The authors propose that positive and negative UGC only provide opportunities for consumers to process product-related information, whereas both mixed- and indifferent-neutral UGC affect consumers? motivation and ability to process positive and negative UGC. The results of three studies using multiple measures (text and numerical UGC), contexts (automobiles, movies, and tablets), and methods (empirical and behavioral experiment) indicate contrasting premium and discount effects such that mixed-neutral UGC amplifies the effects of positive and negative UGC, whereas indifferent-neutral UGC attenuates them. Empirical evidence further indicates that ignoring mixed- or indifferent-neutral UGC leads to substantial under- or overestimates of the effects of positive and negative UGC. The effects of neutral UGC on product sales thus are not truly neutral, and the direction of the bias depends on both the type of UGC and the distribution of positive and negative UGC.",0
"That?s Not So Bad, I?ll Eat More! Backfire Effects of Calories-per-Serving Information on Snack Consumption",Journal of Marketing,2018,"This research investigates how provision of calories-per-serving information on serving size labels affects snack consumption quantity. Drawing from expectancy-disconfirmation theory, this research shows that providing calories-per-serving information can ironically create a consumption backfire effect (consumers eat more when presented with calories-per-serving information) for snacks perceived as unhealthy but not for snacks perceived as healthy. The authors find that this effect arises when calorie expectations are higher than the posted calories-per-serving level?a frequent occurrence due to stated serving sizes that are typically smaller than amounts consumed in one sitting. The authors also show that attention to calorie information plays a key role such that the backfire effect occurs among consumers who pay more attention to calorie information. Furthermore, motivational factors including individual differences and perceptions of the risk associated with consuming a snack also play a role in driving consumption differences. The authors offer managerial, policy, and consumer welfare implications, including proposing and testing larger stated serving sizes as an intervention.",0
Balancing Risk and Return in a Customer Portfolio,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Marketing managers can increase shareholder value by structuring a customer portfolio to reduce the vulnerability and volatility of cash flows. This article demonstrates how financial portfolio theory provides an organizing framework for (1) diagnosing the variability in a customer portfolio, (2) assessing the complementarity/similarity of market segments, (3) exploring market segment weights in an optimized portfolio, and (4) isolating the reward on variability that individual customers or segments provide. Using a seven-year series of customer data from a large business-to-business firm, the authors demonstrate how market segments can be characterized in terms of risk and return. Next, they identify the firm's efficient portfolio and test it against (1) its current portfolio and (2) a hypothetical profit maximization portfolio. Then, using forward- and back-testing, the authors show that the efficient portfolio has consistently lower variability than the existing customer mix and the profit maximization portfolio. The authors provide guidelines for incorporating a risk overlay into established customer management frameworks. The approach is especially well suited for business-to-business firms that serve market segments drawn from diverse sectors of the economy.",0
Auditory and Visual Brand Identifiers in Chinese and English,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"A main component of branding is to link a brand name to nonverbal cues that facilitate brand name memory. The authors examine the integration in memory of auditory and visual brand identifiers with brand names written in the logographic Chinese script compared with the alphabetic English script. The first experiment compares native Mandarin speakers living in China with native English speakers living in the United States. The second experiment examines bilingual Cantonese?English speakers living in Hong Kong. The results of the experiments suggest that visual brand identifiers are integrated in memory more easily with Chinese brand names, whereas auditory brand identifiers are integrated in memory more easily with English brand names. These results are of theoretical interest because they demonstrate that writing systems affect cognitive processes that are involved in the integration of words with nonverbal information. The results are of practical interest because they suggest that the relative success of auditory and visual brand identity strategies is affected by differences in writing systems.",0
The Differential Interaction of Auditory and Visual Advertising Elements with Chinese and English,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Multimedia advertisements often contain nonverbal auditory elements, such as music and sound effects, and nonverbal visual elements, such as images and logos. On the one hand, these elements can have the unintended negative effect of interfering with the processing of the verbal ad copy. Two experiments demonstrate that auditory elements interfere more with the learning of and cognitive responding to English ad copy than with Chinese ad copy, and vice versa for visual elements. On the other hand, auditory and visual elements have the intended positive effect of facilitating ad copy recall when they are reinstated as part of an integrated marketing campaign or as a recall cue in an advertising tracking study. A third experiment demonstrates that auditory elements are better retrieval cues for English than for Chinese ad copy, and vice versa for visual elements. The authors discuss implications of these cross-linguistic differences for the effective design of multimedia communications, integrated marketing campaigns, advertising tracking studies, and cross-cultural research.",1
Employee-Based Brand Equity: Why Firms with Strong Brands Pay Their Executives Less,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"This article examines the concept of employee-based brand equity?the value that a brand provides to a firm through its effects on the attitudes and behaviors of its employees?and empirically demonstrates its significance on executive pay. Executives value being associated with strong brands and, therefore, accept substantially lower pay at firms that own strong brands. Consistent with identity theory, this effect is stronger for chief executive officers and younger executives than for other executives. Data from a large, cross-industry sample of executives suggest that academics and practitioners should take a broader view of the contributions of brand-related investments to firm value and make use of strong brands in pay negotiations that are typically viewed as being outside the realm of marketing.",1
"Who Standardizes Advertising more Frequently, and Why Do They Do So? A Comparison of U.S. and Japanese Subsidiaries? Advertising Practices in the European Union",Journal of International Marketing,2006,"This study reports the results of a survey of executives of subsidiaries of Japanese and U.S. firms operating in the European Union (EU). The fundamental issues addressed are the degree to which firms perceive EU national markets as similar, the degree to which firms use standardized advertising across the EU, and firms? reasons for standardizing advertising. Global marketing strategy theory contends that firms are more likely to follow a strategy if the environment is conducive to that strategy, suggesting that greater convergence of EU markets would lead to greater standardization of advertising. The findings of this study indicate that both Japanese and U.S. managers still note obstacles to the standardization of advertising in the EU. Consistent with global marketing strategy theory, overall levels of standardization of advertising are somewhat moderate. Firms in the United States are slightly more likely than Japanese firms to use a standardized advertising strategy in the EU. In addition, U.S. firms tend to put greater emphasis on the creation of a uniform brand image, whereas managers from both countries value cost savings. Japanese firms value the higher level of central control that can emanate from standardization.",0
The Impact of Brand Differentiating Messages on the Effectiveness of Korean Advertising,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Many U.S. advertisers have long stressed the need to use the advertising message to differentiate a brand from its major competitors. This conventional wisdom has been supported empirically by Stewart and Furse's (1986) study of more than 1,000 television commercials, which found a positive relationship between the presence of a brand differentiating message and advertising effectiveness. The question of whether this important research finding extends cross-culturally to South Korea is investigated in this article. To this end, an experiment was conducted in Seoul using selected commercials from a large content-analyzed database of Korean television advertisements. Results suggest that brand differentiation can be an effective technique for firms advertising in Korea.",0
Emotion-Induced Engagement in Internet Video Advertisements,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"This study shows how advertisers can leverage emotion and attention to engage consumers in watching Internet video advertisements. In a controlled experiment, the authors assessed joy and surprise through automated facial expression detection for a sample of advertisements. They assessed concentration of attention through eye tracking and viewer retention by recording zapping behavior. This allows tests of predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However, importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric, with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases. Using these findings, the authors develop representative emotion trajectories to support ad design and testing.",1
A Mixture Model for Internet Search-Engine Visits,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,The authors extend the marketing literature on stochastic interpurchase-time models by allowing for purchase periodicities and unobserved heterogeneity in a proportional hazards mixture model. Their parsimonious framework builds on commonly used baseline hazard functions. They use the search-engine visits data to highlight the benefits of the proposed model.,1
The Relationship between Mass Media Availability and the Multicountry Diffusion of Consumer Products,Journal of International Marketing,1999,This article proposes and tests a relationship between mass media availability and new product sales in a multicountry environment. Theoretical support is derived from the behavioral and modeling literature on diffusion of innovation. Empirical support is obtained for a model that compares mass media availability with measures of new product sales in a variety of countries. The results suggest that variations in media availability have predictable effects on the speed and pattern of new product sales. These findings help clarify the underlying forces that may influence multinational variations in new product introductions. They also suggest several options for forecasting and managing new products in a multicountry environment.,0
"Which Ad Works, When, Where, and how Often? Modeling the Effects of Direct Television Advertising",Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The authors develop a model to decompose the effects of television advertising for a toll-free referral service, at the hourly level. The model estimates which ad works, when, in which station, and for how long. Results of the analysis show that ads do stimulate direct response, but their effects dissipate very rapidly. Effectiveness and profitability vary substantially by creative, television station, and station x time of the day. The results underscore the need for managers to undertake such analyses and for researchers to use such a disaggregate approach.",1
"What Drives Virality (Sharing) of Online Digital Content? The Critical Role of Information, Emotion, and Brand Prominence",Journal of Marketing,2019,"The authors test five theoretically derived hypotheses about what drives video ad sharing across multiple social media platforms. Two independent field studies test these hypotheses using 11 emotions and over 60 ad characteristics. The results are consistent with theory and robust across studies. Information-focused content has a significantly negative effect on sharing, except in risky contexts. Positive emotions of amusement, excitement, inspiration, and warmth positively affect sharing. Various drama elements such as surprise, plot, and characters, including babies, animals, and celebrities arouse emotions. Prominent (early vs. late, long vs. short duration, persistent vs. pulsing) placement of brand names hurts sharing. Emotional ads are shared more on general platforms (Facebook, Google+, Twitter) than on LinkedIn, and the reverse holds for informational ads. Sharing is also greatest when ad length is moderate (1.2 to 1.7 minutes). Contrary to these findings, ads use information more than emotions, celebrities more than babies or animals, prominent brand placement, little surprise, and very short or very long ads. A third study shows that the identified drivers predict sharing accurately in an entirely independent sample.",0
Radical Innovation across Nations: The Preeminence of Corporate Culture,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Radical innovation is an important driver of the growth, success, and wealth of firms and nations. Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have proposed many theories about the drivers of such innovation, including government policy and labor, capital, and culture at the national level. The authors contrast these theories with one based on the corporate culture of the firm. They test their theory using survey and archival data from 759 firms across 17 major economies of the world. The results suggest the following: First, among the factors studied, corporate culture is the strongest driver of radical innovation across nations; culture consists of three attitudes and three practices. Second, the commercialization of radical innovations translates into a firm's financial performance; it is a stronger predictor of financial performance than other popular measures, such as patents. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.",0
Global Consumer Innovativeness: Cross-Country Differences and Demographic Commonalities,Journal of International Marketing,2009,"Despite extensive research on consumer innovativeness, the literature does not contain a parsimonious construct that has been validated for use across countries, demographics, and categories. This study attempts to fill this gap by studying consumer innovativeness across 15 major world economies. Significantly, the authors find that four negatively valenced items constitute a construct of innovativeness that seems reasonably applicable across most countries. Although this construct of innovativeness varies systematically from country to country, common demographic antecedents emerge across countries. Within these commonalities, a measure of innovativeness shows some distinct category ? demographics and category ? country differences.",0
Does Quality Win? Network Effects versus Quality in High-Tech Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Researchers disagree about the critical drivers of success in and efficiency of high-tech markets. On the one hand, some researchers assert that high-tech markets are efficient with best-quality brands being dominant. On the other hand, many scholars suspect that network effects lead to perverse markets in which the dominant brands do not have the best quality. The authors develop scenarios about the relative importance of these effects and the efficiency of markets. Empirical analysis of historical data on 19 categories shows that though both quality and network effects affect market share flows, in general markets are efficient. In particular, market share leadership changes often, switches in share leadership closely follow switches in quality leadership, and the best-quality brands, not the ones that are first to enter, dominate the market. Network effects enhance the positive effect of quality.",1
Using EEG to Predict Consumers? Future Choices,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"It is well established that neural imaging technology can predict preferences for consumer products. However, the applicability of this method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method?electroencephalography (EEG)?can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.",1
"Interactive Effects of Appeals, Arguments, and Competition across North American and Chinese Cultures",Journal of International Marketing,2006,"Using data from actual consumers in North America and China, this research analyzes the interactive effects of appeals and arguments in a competitive environment. The theoretical basis for this study is that contrast effects are most likely to occur when consumers experience advertisements with distinct culture-laden advertising appeals and comparable arguments. The findings indicate that a culturally congruent appeal and a strong argument embedded in an advertisement may create more favorable responses when competing advertisements contain culturally incongruent appeals and neutral arguments than when competing advertisements contain culturally congruent appeals and neutral arguments.",0
Retailer Private-Label Margins: The Role of Supplier and Quality-Tier Differentiation,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The authors show how new realities in the private-label (PL) landscape, including differential PL-sourcing relationships and differentiated, three-tiered PL portfolios, affect the gross margins that retailers realize on their PLs. In addition, they examine the moderating role of the identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand?oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer's practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (hard) discounters at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus. However, the higher promotional support often given to premium PLs tends to mitigate the actual margin advantage.",0
Strategic Alliances in the Triad: An Exploratory Study,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"The Triad nations?Japan, North America, and Western Europe? have emerged in recent decades. To cope with the growing international competition between these areas, firms based in these countries have formed strategic alliances, frequently with partners from another member of the Triad. This article examines these alliances to determine the patterns, similarities, and differences between alliances formed in different parts of the Triad.",0
Executive Insights: The Global Network Communications Agency,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"Cross-ownership of brand-name agencies, spin-offs of functional areas, and incorporation of nontraditional marketing communications services are the structural foundations of the global network communications agency. Global capabilities are the new criteria for managing agency?client partnerships. In response, agencies differentiate themselves, increase input, and assure clients of uniform decision-making processes across their network by using ?branded? decision tools and agency?client intranets. The core competencies expected from the global network communications agency include brand-planning skills, understanding of relevant consumers, decision aids that facilitate decision processes, information systems that maximize experiences and communications, and an ability to bridge cultures. These changes highlight the need to improve human resources management and the competitive appeal of service portfolios, as well as institutionalized knowledge sharing within networks.",0
Assessing National Identity in Russia between Generations using the National Identity Scale,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"This research examines the structure of the national identity (NATID) scale in Russia. On the basis of confirmatory factor analysis results, the authors recommend modifications to strengthen the construct's application. By employing multigroup analysis, the authors assess the relationships between each NATID scale component (national heritage, cultural homogeneity, belief system, and consumer ethnocentrism) and overall national identity for invariance across two different Russian age cohorts: Soviet Russians and contemporary Russians. Soviet Russians reached their ?age of socialization? when the Soviet Union was intact, whereas contemporary Russians achieved their age of socialization during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras. The results indicate a lack of invariance across age cohorts in the relationship between all the subconstructs, with the exception of national heritage, and overall national identity. As a result, researchers should consider that the relationship between components of the NATID scale and overall national identity is likely to vary in strength across groups in the same country. This insight is significant for firms that conduct market research, introduce products, and develop marketing strategies for selected markets.",0
The Export Information System: An Empirical Investigation of Its Antecedents and Performance Outcomes,Journal of International Marketing,2013,"Marketing literature has widely acknowledged the significant contribution of information-processing activities to export organizations? success. The export information system (EIS) comprises four key dimensions: information sources, information acquisition, information dissemination, and information utilization. The current research develops and empirically tests a comprehensive conceptual framework that assesses (1) the chain of effects linking the four key dimensions of the EIS, (2) the influence of organizational structure (i.e., formalization and centralization) on the efficiency of export information dissemination, and (3) the relationship between the EIS and export performance. The authors also investigate the moderating effects of certain environmental forces (i.e., market turbulence and intensity of competition). The findings support the critical role of information processing in the success of small and medium-sized exporters. The authors conclude by discussing the study's implications for academic researchers and practitioners as well as directions for further research in the field.",0
Factors Influencing the Degree of International Pricing Strategy Standardization of Multinational Corporations,Journal of International Marketing,2001,"In response to certain important gaps identified in the global marketing literature, the focus of this inquiry is an investigation of the pricing strategies followed by manufacturing subsidiaries of multinational corporations. Specifically, the authors attempt to identify the factors that play an important role in determining the degree of international pricing strategy standardization. The findings suggest that the extent to which multinationals standardize their international pricing strategies depends on the level of similarity between home and host countries in terms of customer characteristics, legal environment, economic conditions, and stage of the product life cycle. The authors highlight implications of the findings for business practitioners and discuss future research directions along with the limitations of the study.",0
Artificial Neural Network Decision Support Systems for New Product Development Project Selection,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,The authors extend and develop an artificial neural network decision support system and demonstrate how it can guide managers when they make complex new product development decisions. The authors use data from 612 projects to compare this new method with traditional methods for predicting various success outcomes for new product projects.,1
Seeking an Expanding Competitor: How Product Line Expansion Can Increase All Firms' Profits,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The author examines conditions under which one firm's product line expansion can cause all firms to be more profitable in horizontally differentiated markets. Although a firm's profits might be expected to decrease when a competitor expands its product line because the firm loses some sales to the new product, this intuition is incomplete because a competitor's product line expansion can also soften price competition. The author first provides an example using the Hotelling model that demonstrates the possibility and mechanism of profit-increasing competitor entry. He then presents conditions under which a competitor's product line expansion increases profits under the mixed-logit model. The study demonstrates that firms benefit from a rival's entry most when a moderate number of customers are unserved before the new-product introduction and when the new product is positioned such that both the rivals' products appeal to similar sets of customers. With regard to extensions, this study demonstrates that the result continues to hold when firms choose product attributes endogenously and that a manufacturer's profits can increase from a rival's product line expansion even when the firms sell through a retailer.",1
A Methodology for Linking Customer Acquisition to Customer Retention,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Customer acquisition and retention are not independent processes. However, because of data limitations, customer management decisions are frequently based only on an analysis of acquired customers. This analysis shows that these decisions can be biased and misleading. The author presents a modeling approach that estimates the length of a customer's lifetime and adjusts for this bias. Using the model, the author shows the financial impact of not accounting for the effect of acquisition on customer retention.",1
Recapturing Lost Customers,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"For both academics and practitioners, the dominant focus of customer relationship management has been customer retention. The authors assert that customer winback should also be an important part of a customer relationship management strategy. Customer winback focuses on the reinitiation and management of relationships with customers who have lapsed or defected from a firm. In some cases, firms engage in extensive efforts to reacquire lapsed customers or defectors, and a common tactic is lowering the price to reacquire a customer. This investigation goes beyond the reacquisition pricing strategy and also examines the optimal pricing strategy when the customer has decided to reinitiate the relationship. By simultaneously modeling reacquisition and duration of the second tenure with the firm, the authors determine that the optimal pricing strategy for their application involves a low reacquisition price and higher prices when customers have been reacquired. In addition to pricing strategy, they also discuss the implications of their findings for targeting lapsed customers for reacquisition.",1
Managing Marketing Communications with Multichannel Customers,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This article presents a marketing communications process that uses customer relationship management ideas for multichannel retailers. The authors describe and then demonstrate the process with enterprise-level data from a major U.S. retailer with multiple channels. On the basis of the results, the authors develop an initial marketing communications strategy for the retailer.",0
When Internal Reference Prices and Price Expectations Diverge: The Role of Confidence,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"When do internal reference prices differ from articulated price expectations? The authors propose that the internal reference price depends not only on the magnitude of the expected price but also on the confidence associated with this expectation. Four experiments delineate the effects of price expectation and confidence on the internal reference price. In Experiments 1 and 2, the authors manipulate repetition and examine the effects of repetition-induced confidence on price judgments. In Experiments 3 and 4, they manipulate confidence directly to investigate its effects on judgments. The results from all four experiments suggest that consumers with less confidence have higher internal reference prices than more confident consumers, even when they do not differ in their articulated price expectations. The authors discuss the implications of these results for pricing theory.",1
The Ease-of-Computation Effect: The Interplay of Metacognitive Experiences and Naive Theories in Judgments of Price Differences,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Consumers? judgments of the magnitude of numerical differences are influenced by the ease of mental computations. The results from a set of experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices. Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 ? 3.96, an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations (e.g., 5.00 ? 4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00). The effect does not manifest when judgments do not entail mental computations or when participants are made aware that the ease or difficulty is caused by computational complexity. Furthermore, this effect is mitigated when participants? prior experience is manipulated in a learning phase of the experiment. The results have implications for buyers and sellers and for understanding the role of metacognitive experiences in numerical judgments.",1
The Digital and Physical Footprint of Dark Net Markets,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Over the past decade, the world has been contending with a growing set of challenges related to illicit traffic as advancements in technology, communications, and global integration facilitate the operation of black markets and greater organization of criminal activity. In this study, the dark web and associated dark net markets are introduced as an important context for scholars interested in international marketing. Furthermore, the scale, scope, and structure of the real-world drug trade is empirically analyzed as an example of the work possible within this dark world. The study concludes by highlighting key themes from the literature in international marketing scholarship and focuses on how they might be co-opted to contribute toward the understanding and countermarketing of illicit systems of exchange.",0
What Goes around Comes around: The Impact of Marketing Alliances on Firm Risk and the Moderating Role of Network Density,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Although the value gained from partnership formation (through alliances) or through the firm's position in a network has received significant research attention, little is known about the risks that can accompany this increasing reliance on partners. The authors investigate the change in firm idiosyncratic and systematic risks after the announcement of marketing alliances and analyze whether the density of the firm's network of alliance partners moderates the risk exposure, demonstrated through investors' expectations of a firm's risk or the equity risk of a firm. The results indicate that marketing alliances reduce firm risk, so long as the alliance is a novel connection between the partnering firms. Furthermore, at high levels, the interconnectedness of partners or density of a firm's network can cause idiosyncratic risk to increase, and the density of a partner's network can also result in increases in systematic risk of a firm after alliance formation.",0
Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgnger Brand Image,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Emotional branding is widely heralded as a key to marketing success. However, little attention has been given to the risks posed by this strategy. This article argues that emotional-branding strategies are conducive to the emergence of a doppelgnger brand image, which is defined as a family of disparaging images and meanings about a brand that circulate throughout popular culture. This article's thesis is that a doppelgnger brand image can undermine the perceived authenticity of an emotional-branding story and, thus, the identity value that the brand provides to consumers. The authors discuss how the tenets of emotional branding paradoxically encourage the formation and propagation of doppelgnger brand imagery. This article develops the counterintuitive proposition that rather than merely being a threat to be managed, a doppelgnger brand image can actually benefit a brand by providing early warning signs that an emotional-branding story is beginning to lose its cultural resonance. This article demonstrates these ideas through an analysis of the doppelgnger brand image that is beginning to haunt a paragon of emotional branding?Starbucks. The authors conclude with a discussion of how marketing managers can proactively use the insights gained by analyzing a doppelgnger brand image.",0
Feature Fatigue: When Product Capabilities Become Too Much of a Good Thing,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"As technology advances, it becomes more feasible to load products with a large number of features, each of which individually might be perceived as useful. However, too many features can make a product overwhelming for consumers and difficult to use. Three studies examine how consumers balance their desires for capability and usability when they evaluate products and how these desires shift over time. Because consumers give more weight to capability and less weight to usability before use than after use, they tend to choose overly complex products that do not maximize their satisfaction when they use them, resulting in ?feature fatigue.? An analytical model based on these results provides additional insights into the feature fatigue effect. This model shows that choosing the number of features that maximizes initial choice results in the inclusion of too many features, potentially decreasing customer lifetime value. As the emphasis on future sales increases, the optimal number of features decreases. The results suggest that firms should consider having a larger number of more specialized products, each with a limited number of features, rather than loading all possible features into one product.",1
When Disfluency Signals Competence: The Effect of Processing Difficulty on Perceptions of Service Agents,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"This research examines the effect of processing fluency on judgments of agent competence. In the context of service relationships, four studies reveal that the experience of processing difficulty, or disfluency, enhances expectations of agent-exerted effort and competence, which in turn increase expected service value. When reading information about a target service, consumers interpret the difficulty of processing information as a signal of the level of skill required to execute the task, which highlights the agent's expected utility. The authors explore several moderators of this positive effect of disfluency, showing that it is attenuated under conditions that decrease the relevance of consumers? subjective experiences and it may be reversed on measures of experienced (vs. expected) service value.",1
Consumer-Generated Ads: Does Awareness of Advertising Co-Creation Help or Hurt Persuasion?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Companies increasingly involve consumers in the process of developing advertising and other marketing actions. An important question that has not been explored is whether brands benefit from communicating to consumers who had not been involved in the co-creation process that a target ad was developed by a fellow consumer. The authors propose a skepticism?identification model of ad creator influence, which hypothesizes that disclosing to an audience that an ad was created by a consumer triggers two opposing effects: skepticism about the competence of the ad creator and identification with the ad creator. Four studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of disclosing advertising co-creation depends on factors that hinder skepticism and heighten identification with the ad creator. Specifically, attributing the ad to a consumer is shown to increase persuasion when the audience (1) has limited cognitive resources to scrutinize the message, (2) is given background information about the ad creator that enhances source similarity, and (3) has high loyalty toward the brand. The implications of these findings on marketing theory and practice are discussed.",0
The Social Utility of Feature Creep,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Previous research has shown that consumers frequently choose products with too many features that they later find difficult to use. In this research, the authors show that this seemingly suboptimal behavior may actually confer benefits when factoring in the social context of consumption. The results demonstrate that choosing products with more capabilities (i.e., feature-rich products) provides social utility beyond inferences of wealth, signaling consumers' technological skills and openness to new experiences and that consumers' beliefs about the social utility of feature-rich products are predictive of their choices of such products. Furthermore, the authors examine when impression management concerns increase consumers' likelihood of choosing feature-rich products. They find that public choices in which participants display their preferences to others encourage feature-seeking behavior but that the anticipation of having to use a product in front of others provides an incentive to avoid additional features.",1
Loyalty Programs in Emerging and Developed Markets: The Impact of Cultural Values on Loyalty Program Choice,Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Loyalty programs increase customers? repeat purchase behavior and reward their continued patronage by enhancing the firm's value proposition. Yet little is known about how cultural values affect loyalty program choice as firms expand abroad. This understanding is important because multinational corporations must decide whether to standardize or adapt their loyalty programs when internationalizing. The authors develop and test theory proposing that cultural values influence loyalty program choice. The results indicate that cultural differences matter. Consumers from countries high in power-distance values and low in individualism values prefer loyalty programs that offer related rewards, whereas consumers from countries low in masculinity values and low in uncertainty avoidance values prefer unrelated rewards. The analysis also indicates that consumers from countries high in masculinity values and high in uncertainty avoidance values shun loyalty programs altogether and prefer immediate promotional offers. This finding suggests that loyalty programs do not work equally well in all countries and that multinational corporations may need to adapt reward programs as they internationalize to ensure that their loyalty-building efforts are successful.",0
Community Participation and Consumer-to-Consumer Helping: Does Participation in Third Party?Hosted Communities Reduce One's Likelihood of Helping?,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Third party?hosted consumer communities in general, and brand communities in particular, have been touted for their ability to generate value for firms by promoting consumer-to-consumer (C2C) helping. However, little research has examined whether consumer communities actually foster C2C helping, and who is helped. In contrast, the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood of community members helping non?community members. If so, strategies that promote third party?hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C2C helping. Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both? On the basis of a hazard model analysis of 9,192 actual C2C helping events over a 25-month period, and supported by a second cross-sectional study, this article examines how participation in brand and product-category communities influences one's likelihood of helping others. We find that brand-community participation increases one's likelihood of helping fellow members while reducing the likelihood of helping members of rival brand communities. Surprisingly, product-category community participation reduces one's likelihood of helping members of brand communities. The authors discuss managerial recommendations.",1
Brand Communities and New Product Adoption: The Influence and Limits of Oppositional Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Brand communities have been cited for their potential not only to enhance the loyalty of members but also to engender a sense of oppositional loyalty toward competing brands. However, the impact of brand community membership on actual new product adoption behavior has yet to be explored. This study examines the effects of brand community participation and membership duration on the adoption of new products from opposing brands as well as from the preferred brand. Longitudinal data were collected on the participation behavior, membership duration, and adoption behavior of 7506 members spanning four brand communities and two product categories. Using a hazard modeling approach, the authors find that higher levels of participation and longer-term membership in a brand community not only increase the likelihood of adopting a new product from the preferred brand but also decrease the likelihood of adopting new products from opposing brands. However, such oppositional loyalty is contingent on whether a competitor's new product is the first to market. Furthermore, in the case of overlapping memberships, higher levels of participation in a brand community may actually increase the likelihood of adopting products from rival brands. This finding is both surprising and disconcerting because marketing managers usually do not know which other memberships their brand community members possess. The authors discuss how managers can enhance the impact of their brand community on the adoption of the company's new products while limiting the impact of opposing brand communities.",0
Human Brands: Investigating Antecedents to Consumers? Strong Attachments to Celebrities,Journal of Marketing,2006,"This article explores recent advances in self-determination research to address why consumers develop strong attachments to ?human brands,? a term that refers to any well-known persona who is the subject of marketing communications efforts. Study 1 uses a survey that is analyzed with structural equation modeling. Study 2 is qualitative and offers corroborating evidence for the proposed theoretical model. Study 3 extends the model with a more naturalistic sample and tests several alternative hypotheses using hierarchical regression. The results suggest that when a human brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy and relatedness and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person is likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article documents that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied, trusting, and committed relationships and proposes that attachment strength may be a parsimonious proxy for consumer?brand relationship strength. The results imply that benefits would accrue to organizations such as entertainment firms and political parties that establish direct and routine interaction between human brands and consumers, that human brands to which consumers are attached offer significant potential as endorsers, and that organizations should address how to make the human brands they manage more authentic.",0
"Differential Effects of Customers? Regulatory Fit on Trust, Perceived Value, and M-Commerce Use among Developing and Developed Countries",Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Despite promising growth, mobile commerce (m-commerce) still represents only a small proportion of the world's total e-commerce market. The research behind this article moves away from the predominantly single-country (typically developed) and utilitarian-focused market scope of past research to examine and provide a more nuanced understanding of customers? motivations, whether utilitarian or hedonic, for using m-commerce across six countries. The six-country context, with data collected from 1,183 m-commerce users, offers a unique opportunity to advance mobile-retailing literature by comparing customers? value perceptions, trust, and m-commerce use across disparate national markets. By treating motivations as conditions activated by individuals? chronic regulatory orientations, our results show that hedonic motivation plays a more significant role in influencing customers? value perceptions and trust for those who are promotion oriented (Australia and the United States), whereas utilitarian motivation plays a more important role for those who are prevention oriented (Bangladesh and Vietnam). Finally, both hedonic and utilitarian motivations play an important role in influencing customers? value perceptions and trust for those who are moderately promotion and prevention oriented (India and Pakistan). These results offer insights to mobile retailers operating internationally in their decisions to standardize or adapt the mobile-shopping environment to deliver the most valuable, trustworthy, and engaging solutions to customers.",0
How to Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Improved Variable Selection for New Customer Acquisition,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Steady customer losses create pressure for firms to acquire new accounts, a task that is both costly and risky. Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees. Notably, the optimal results show that the Bayesian approach selects panel-based metrics as predictors, detects several nonlinear relationships, selects very large numbers of addresses, and generates profits. In a series of post hoc analyses, the authors consider prospects? response behaviors and cross-selling potential and systematically vary the number of predictors and the estimated profit per response. The results reveal that more predictors and higher response rates do not necessarily lead to higher profits.",0
Regulatory Exposure of Deceptive Marketing and Its Impact on Firm Value,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Research linking marketing to financial performance has predominantly focused on how marketing assets and actions add value. The authors argue that it is equally important to understand how marketing decisions can reduce firm value. Prior research has indicated that negative events vary greatly in their indirect costs to the firm. On the basis of established theory and in-depth interviews with practitioners, the authors identify a set of factors that can explain the heterogeneity in the magnitude of indirect costs associated with negative marketing-related events. Specifically, they address how the regulatory exposure of deceptive marketing, which carries no direct cost to the firm, affects shareholder value. Using an event study, the analysis shows that incidents of exposed deceptive marketing are associated with significant, negative abnormal returns amounting to a drop of 1%, which translates into a wealth loss of $86 million for the median-sized firm in the sample. In explaining the variation in magnitude of the impact between events, the authors find that, in general, event characteristics are more significant than firm and brand characteristics. When deception is highly egregious or directed at vulnerable populations, firm value is more negatively affected than when the potential to mislead and harm is not readily verifiable. Furthermore, when the cited product has substantial brand market share, the levels of egregiousness and target audience explain substantially more of the variation in event impact than when brand market share is low. The results are robust to alternative stock-portfolio-based measures of abnormal returns, model specification, heteroskedasticity, and examination of risk. The authors' framework and analysis have implications for Wall Street executives, Main Street managers, academic researchers, and public policy makers.",0
Mining Marketing Meaning from Online Chatter: Strategic Brand Analysis of Big Data Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Online chatter, or user-generated content, constitutes an excellent emerging source for marketers to mine meaning at a high temporal frequency. This article posits that this meaning consists of extracting the key latent dimensions of consumer satisfaction with quality and ascertaining the valence, labels, validity, importance, dynamics, and heterogeneity of those dimensions. The authors propose a unified framework for this purpose using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The sample of user-generated content consists of rich data on product reviews across 15 firms in five markets over four years. The results suggest that a few dimensions with good face validity and external validity are enough to capture quality. Dynamic analysis enables marketers to track dimensions? importance over time and allows for dynamic mapping of competitive brand positions on those dimensions over time. For vertically differentiated markets (e.g., mobile phones, computers), objective dimensions dominate and are similar across markets, heterogeneity is low across dimensions, and stability is high over time. For horizontally differentiated markets (e.g., shoes, toys), subjective dimensions dominate but vary across markets, heterogeneity is high across dimensions, and stability is low over time.",1
"The Relationships among Quality, Cost, Value, and use of Export Market Information: An Empirical Study",Journal of International Marketing,2004,"Building on prior research in export market information use, consumer behavior, and industrial marketing, this study tests relationships among quality, cost, value, and use of export market information. The results show that perceived value of information is the main impetus for use of export market information, whereas perceived quality and cost function best as indicators of value. This implies that value of information captures the essence of the assessment of information-specific factors, which again provides guidelines for predictive purposes as well as clues for increasing the perceived value of information for customers.",0
Social Interactions and Monetary Incentives in Driving Consumer Repeat Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Companies are eager to leverage social interactions among consumers by embedding social networking tools on their websites and actively integrating marketing actions with consumers' social activities. In this article, the authors investigate the impact of online social interactions on repeat usage behavior and the effectiveness of monetary incentives by formulating a model that parses out the effects of these individual factors. Using a unique data set from a wellness program, they find that online social interactions play a key role in driving repeat behavior, and after controlling for contemporaneous correlations from same-office friends, the social influence emanates even from distant friends working in different offices. The authors also find that monetary incentives have a significant impact on repeat usage and that ignoring this may overstate the impact of social influence. Furthermore, what-if scenario analyses show that social interactions are more effective than monetary incentives when both are present. The authors then explore social influence theories to understand the underlying process mechanisms that may operate in the repeat usage context. Using these findings, they offer strategic implications for marketing practice.",1
Generating Content Increases Enjoyment by Immersing Consumers and Accelerating Perceived Time,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Advances in technology, particularly smartphones, have unlocked new opportunities for consumers to generate content about experiences while they unfold (e.g., by texting, posting to social media, writing notes), and this behavior has become nearly ubiquitous. The present research examines the effects of generating content during ongoing experiences. Across nine studies, the authors show that generating content during an experience increases feelings of immersion and makes time feel like it is passing more quickly, which in turn enhances enjoyment of the experience. The authors investigate these effects across a broad array of experiences both inside and outside the lab that vary in duration from a few minutes to several hours, including positive and negative videos and real-life holiday celebrations. They conclude with several studies testing marketing interventions that increase content creation and find that consumers who are incentivized or motivated by social norms to generate content reap the same experiential benefits as those who create content organically. These findings illustrate how leveraging content creation to improve experiences can mutually benefit marketers and consumers.",0
The Calendar Mindset: Scheduling Takes the Fun Out and Puts the Work In,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Consumers often schedule their activities in an attempt to use their time more efficiently. Although the benefits of scheduling are well established, its potential downsides are not well understood. The authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu) makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by ?roughly scheduling? (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity. The reported findings highlight an important opportunity for marketers to improve consumers? experiences and utility by leveraging scheduling behavior while also providing important implications for consumer well-being from leisure consumption.",1
Brand Concepts as Representations of Human Values: Do Cultural Congruity and Compatibility between values Matter?,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Global brands are faced with the challenge of conveying concepts that not only are consistent across borders but also resonate with consumers of different cultures. Building on prior research indicating that abstract brand concepts induce more favorable consumer responses than functional attributes, the authors introduce a generalizable and robust structure of abstract brand concepts as representations of human values. Using three empirical studies conducted with respondents from eight countries, they demonstrate that this proposed structure is particularly useful for predicting (1) brand meanings that are compatible (vs. incompatible) with each other and, consequently, more (less) favorably accepted by consumers when added to an already established brand concept; (2) brand concepts that are more likely to resonate with consumers with differing cultural orientations; and (3) consumers? responses to attempts to imbue an established brand concept with new, (in)compatible abstract meanings as a function of their own cultural orientations.",0
A Poisson Factorization Topic Model for the Study of Creative Documents (and Their Summaries),Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"The author proposes a topic model tailored to the study of creative documents (e.g., academic papers, movie scripts), which extends Poisson factorization in two ways. First, the creativity literature emphasizes the importance of novelty in creative industries. Accordingly, this article introduces a set of residual topics that represent the portion of each document that is not explained by a combination of common topics. Second, creative documents are typically accompanied by summaries (e.g., abstracts, synopses). Accordingly, the author jointly models the content of creative documents and their summaries, and captures systematic variations in topic intensities between the documents and their summaries. This article validates and illustrates the model in three domains: marketing academic papers, movie scripts, and TV show closed captions. It illustrates how the joint modeling of documents and summaries provides some insight into how people summarize creative documents and enhances understanding of the significance of each topic. It shows that the model described produces new measures of distinctiveness that can inform the perennial debate on the relation between novelty and success in creative industries. Finally, the author shows how the proposed model may form the basis for decision support tools that assist people in writing summaries of creative documents.",1
Polyhedral Methods for Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors propose and test a new ?polyhedral? choice-based conjoint analysis question-design method that adapts each respondent's choice sets on the basis of previous answers by that respondent. Polyhedral ?interior-point? algorithms design questions that quickly reduce the sets of partworths that are consistent with the respondent's choices. To identify domains in which individual adaptation is promising (and domains in which it is not), the authors evaluate the performance of polyhedral choice-based conjoint analysis methods with Monte Carlo experiments. They vary magnitude (response accuracy), respondent heterogeneity estimation method, and question-design method in a 4 ? 23 experiment. The estimation methods are hierarchical Bayes and analytic center. The latter is a new individual-level estimation procedure that is a by-product of polyhedral question design. The benchmarks for individual adaptation are random designs, orthogonal designs, and aggregate customization. The simulations suggest that polyhedral question design does well in many domains, particularly those in which heterogeneity and partworth magnitudes are relatively large. The authors test feasibility, test an important design criterion (choice balance), and obtain empirical data on convergence by describing an application to the design of executive education programs in which 354 Web-based respondents answered stated-choice tasks with four service profiles each.",1
Extracting Features of Entertainment Products: A Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation Approach Informed by the Psychology of Media Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors propose a quantitative approach for describing entertainment products, in a way that allows for improving the predictive performance of consumer choice models for these products. Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people?s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the ?character strengths? taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also show that guided LDA can improve the performance of models that predict aggregate outcomes.",1
Who or What to Believe: Trust and the Differential Persuasiveness of Human and Anthropomorphized Messengers,Journal of Marketing,2015,"Participants in three studies read advertisements in which messages were delivered either by people or by anthropomorphized agents?specifically, ?talking? products. The results indicate that people low in interpersonal trust are more persuaded by anthropomorphized messengers than by human spokespeople because low trusters are more attentive to the nature of the messenger and believe that humans, more than partial humans (i.e., anthropomorphized agents), lack goodwill. People high in interpersonal trust are less attentive about who is trying to persuade them and so respond similarly to human and anthropomorphized messengers. However, when prompted to be attentive, they are more persuaded by human spokespeople than by anthropomorphized messengers due to their belief that humans, more than partial humans, act with goodwill. Under conditions in which attentiveness is low for all consumers, high and low trusters alike are unaffected by the nature of persuasion agents. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for advertisers considering the use of anthropomorphized ?spokespeople.?",0
The Role of Cultural Distance Across Quantiles of International Joint Venture Longevity,Journal of International Marketing,2019,"Rapid global economic development and liberalization have increased the motivation and opportunities for firms to enter into international joint venture (IJV) agreements. Numerous studies in the international marketing literature have examined the impact of international partners? cultural differences on IJV longevity; however, results are inconclusive, potentially due to limitations in the methods used. While this study examines the varied impact of cultural differences on IJV longevity based on the IJV?s age, it uses quantile regression, enabling the detection of varying effects? strengths across the dependent variable?s entire distribution. The results demonstrate variations in the role of cultural differences across individual cultural dimensions as well as variations in the patterns of association between cultural differences and IJV longevity dependent on the IJV?s age. Implications for theory and the practice of international marketing are offered as well as potential applications of this study?s methodological approach.",0
Exploring the Marketing Program Antecedents of Performance in a Global Company,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"As the era of globalization continues to manifest through the emergence of global companies, the use of marketing programs in these firms has become increasingly important. This research examines global marketing program?related factors, their drivers, and their performance consequences. The global marketing program, as the authors conceptualize it, consists of three key factors: global marketing strategy, global marketing structure, and global marketing processes. The authors develop and test an empirical model to portray the application of the global marketing program factors with respect to product standardization and product processes. As such, global customer convergence and leadership's global orientation have significant, positive effects on global product standardization and global marketing structure. The authors find that global product standardization and global marketing structure drive the implementation of global product processes, which are positively related to marketing performance.",0
"Bringing ?Place? Back In: Regional Clusters, Project Governance, and New Product Outcomes",Journal of Marketing,2014,"The authors examine new product outcomes in the context of regional clusters. On the basis of prior research on marketing relationships, clusters, and social networks, they propose that the overall configuration of a cluster helps promote particular governance practices among its members. These practices have distinct value-creating properties, and when they are brought to bear on a specific new product development project within a cluster, they promote performance outcomes such as product novelty and speed to market. Ultimately, these performance effects are reinforced by the configuration of the cluster itself. In general, the authors propose that new product outcomes result from complex interactions between a cluster's macro-level configuration and its micro-level governance processes. More broadly, their framework points to the importance of geographical variables and to the role of ?place? in marketing decision making.",0
Eco-Innovations in Global Markets: The Effect of Ecological (In)Congruence on Consumers? Adoption Intentions,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way. This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM) concept, which reflects consumers? perception of a country?s commitment to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to ?ecological (in)congruence??when the sustainability reputation of a COM is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels?vary across product categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions, whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.",0
Making Warnings about Misleading Advertising and Product Recalls more Effective: An Implicit Attitude Perspective,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors tested whether image-based information is more effective than text in changing implicit attitudes from positive to negative, even when both forms similarly change explicit attitudes. They studied corrective information (i.e., warnings about misleading advertising and product recall notices) because it is a common, important effort to change consumer attitudes. Corrective information in the form of pictures or imagery-evoking text, as well as direct instructions to imagine the scene, changed implicit attitudes more than plain, descriptive text, which is currently the most common warning method. Image-based stimuli can change implicit attitudes because they evoke vivid visual mental imagery of counterattitudinal valence (Experiments 1?2). Conditions that hindered the formation of visual mental imagery blocked implicit attitude change, whereas cognitive busyness did not (Experiment 3). In short, imagery-based information changed both explicit and implicit attitudes, whereas materials not based on imagery changed only explicit attitudes. Managers and regulators who aim to protect consumers from claims and products that could do harm should use image-based campaigns to best convey the message effectively.",1
Cross-Functional Integration and New Product Success: An Empirical Investigation of the Findings,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Although cross-functional integration is often considered an important element in a successful new product development program, a great deal of variance exists in extant literature regarding how integration is defined and implemented and how relevant studies are conducted. The authors attempt to bring clarity to a diverse set of 25 studies that investigate cross-functional integration by empirically analyzing 146 correlations between integration and aspects of new product success. The authors examine the impact of 12 potential moderators that affect the integration?success link using meta-analysis techniques. The findings indicate that though cross-functional integration may indeed have a direct impact on success, the combination of integration with other variables may be of greater importance. Furthermore, because most of the nine variables that significantly affect the integration?success relationship are either managerially controlled or industry specific, the findings imply that firms should design cross-functional structures to maximize their effectiveness. Other variables that affect the integration?success relationship reflect researchers? methodological decisions, suggesting that care should be taken when designing and interpreting the results of such studies. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and directions for further research.",0
Consumer Participation in Coproduction: ?I Made it Myself? Effects on Consumers? Sensory Perceptions and Evaluations of Outcome and Input Product,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Consumers engage in self-production when they play an active role in the creation of end products, such as preparing a meal or assembling a piece of furniture. In three experimental studies of self-production involving a branded input product, the authors show that consumers? active engagement in the value creation process (preparing a meal) positively biases their evaluations of an outcome (a dish) and an input product (a dinner kit). A positive evaluation bias for the input product occurs despite increased self-attribution due to self-production. In support of an associative self-anchoring explanation and the notion of self-generated validity, self-producing consumers bias their sensory perceptions (e.g., perceived level of saltiness and spiciness) so that they match a positive evaluation of the outcome. Mediation analyses show that perceived self-integration (perceived link between self and outcome) partly mediates the positive effect of self-production on outcome evaluation. The authors conclude that branded input products may benefit from the evaluation bias caused by self-production.",0
Determining Influential Users in Internet Social Networks,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The success of Internet social networking sites depends on the number and activity levels of their user members. Although users typically have numerous connections to other site members (i.e., ?friends?), only a fraction of those so-called friends may actually influence a member's site usage. Because the influence of potentially hundreds of friends needs to be evaluated for each user, inferring precisely who is influential?and, therefore, of managerial interest for advertising targeting and retention efforts?is difficult. The authors develop an approach to determine which users have significant effects on the activities of others using the longitudinal records of members' log-in activity. They propose a nonstandard form of Bayesian shrinkage implemented in a Poisson regression. Instead of shrinking across panelists, strength is pooled across variables within the model for each user. The approach identifies the specific users who most influence others' activity and does so considerably better than simpler alternatives. For the social networking site data, the authors find that, on average, approximately one-fifth of a user's friends actually influence his or her activity level on the site.",1
Effects of Word-of-Mouth versus Traditional Marketing: Findings from an Internet Social Networking Site,Journal of Marketing,2009,"The authors study the effect of word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing on member growth at an Internet social networking site and compare it with traditional marketing vehicles. Because social network sites record the electronic invitations from existing members, outbound WOM can be precisely tracked. Along with traditional marketing, WOM can then be linked to the number of new members subsequently joining the site (sign-ups). Because of the endogeneity among WOM, new sign-ups, and traditional marketing activity, the authors employ a vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach. Estimates from the VAR model show that WOM referrals have substantially longer carryover effects than traditional marketing actions and produce substantially higher response elasticities. Based on revenue from advertising impressions served to a new member, the monetary value of a WOM referral can be calculated; this yields an upper-bound estimate for the financial incentives the firm might offer to stimulate WOM.",0
Improving Prelaunch Diffusion Forecasts: Using Synthetic Networks as Simulated Priors,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Although the role of social networks and consumer interactions in new product diffusion is widely acknowledged, such networks and interactions are often unobservable to researchers. What may be observable, instead, are aggregate diffusion patterns for past products adopted within a particular social network. The authors propose an approach for identifying systematic conditions that are stable across diffusions and thus are ?transferrable? to new product introductions within a given network. Using Facebook applications data, the authors show that incorporation of such systematic conditions improves prelaunch forecasts. This research bridges the gap between the disciplines of Bayesian statistics and agent-based modeling by demonstrating how researchers can use stochastic relationships simulated within complex systems as meaningful inputs for Bayesian inference models.",1
What's in a Brand Name? Assessing the Impact of Rebranding in the Hospitality Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In the context of the U.S. lodging industry (1994?2012), the authors empirically quantify the effects of the two main factors driving the rebranding effects identified by the theoretical branding literature?(1) the brand effect and (2) the interaction effect between the product (the hotel property) and the brands involved?on occupancy rate and other hotel performance indicators. They find that, on average, rebranding results in approximately a 6.31% increase in occupancy rates; 60% of this effect can be attributed to the brand identities (e.g., Holiday Inn) before and after rebranding while the remaining 40% is attributable to the interaction effect. The authors also find heterogeneity in the property?brand interaction effect of rebranding along various observable characteristics of the hotels. They assess the robustness of the results to various model assumptions and alternative instruments; in addition, they use matching estimators for analysis and exploit rebranding as a consequence of hotel mergers as a means of measuring rebranding effects. Finally, the authors consider the impact that rebranding might have on competitors? properties. Their approach to measuring rebranding effects can be applied broadly to firms and industries experiencing a decoupling of the individual components of their value chain.",1
Knowledge Acquisition and Performance of International Joint Ventures in the Transition Economy of Vietnam,Journal of International Marketing,2004,"From a knowledge-based perspective, the authors develop a model that proposes (1) that certain international joint venture characteristics influence the joint venture's knowledge acquisition from its foreign parent and (2) that the amount of knowledge acquired affects venture performance. The authors test the model in Vietnam and find that parental conflict, commitment, and receptivity affect knowledge acquisition. As they hypothesize, the amount of knowledge acquired contributes significantly to venture performance.",0
An Experiment on the Salience of Country-of-Origin in the Era of Global Brands,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This study investigates the salience of country-of-origin effects in an era when firms are globalizing their operations. Country-of-origin (positive or negative) and global brand name (internationally known or new) were manipulated in a 2 by 2 design in which subjects? evaluations were obtained both before and after they tried a product. In contrast to the general notion that a well-known global brand will override the country-of-origin effect, we found the country-of-origin to be an equally salient and more enduring factor in consumer product evaluation. The findings provide some implications for marketing managers in their global product strategy.",0
"Removing Negative Country Images: Effects of Decomposition, Branding, and Product Experience",Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This article reports two studies on how negative country images can be removed by investigating the effects of decomposing country image into component and assembly origins, as well as the effects of global branding and product experience. Study 1 examines the psychological mechanism consumers use when a country image is decomposed into component and assembly origins. Study 2 extends the effect of decomposing country image to the context of global brands and product experience. It was found that subjects do not seem to differ either in the psychological mechanism they use or in their confidence in evaluating a product which is ?made in ? a country versus a product which has its ?components from? and ?is assembled in? the same country. As hypothesized, the effect of country image was weakened when it was decomposed. A strong positive brand was found to override negative assembly origin effect. After the product experience, the component origin effect was also removed. These findings suggest that when manufacturers lower their production costs by globalizing their production lines, they may simultaneously benefit from having a positive product image.",0
Ending a Price Promotion: Retracting it in One Step or Phasing it out Gradually,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Using the literature on both pricing and regret, the authors develop a conceptual model of purchase likelihood and propose a pricing tactic that appears to have marketplace potential. Sellers currently using a hi?lo pricing tactic discount a product for a limited time and then raise the price back to its original level in one step. Here, the authors investigate whether sellers should return prices to their prepromotion levels all at once or in steps. They propose that sellers should consider an alternative tactic, labeled ?steadily decreasing discounting? (SDD). This alternative tactic requires that the seller offer one or more additional discounts that are less than the prior discount before returning the product to its original price. Study 1 is a laboratory experiment that tests the proposed underlying mechanisms (future price expectations and anticipated inaction regret) influencing likelihood to buy. In Study 2, an additional laboratory experiment is undertaken to provide further empirical support in favor of the SDD tactic, to address alternative explanations for the findings, and to demonstrate that there are no negative perceptions associated with using SDD. Study 3 is a field experiment that assesses the effectiveness of SDD, and Study 4 examines scanner panel data to evaluate its generalizability.",0
The Effect of Expiration Dates and Perceived Risk on Purchasing Behavior in Grocery Store Perishable Categories,Journal of Marketing,2005,"In this article, the authors examine consumers? behavior with respect to expiration dates for grocery store perishable products. A better understanding of such behavior can both guide efforts to educate consumers about the risks associated with perishables that are approaching their expiration dates and help managers implement effective promotional strategies for these products throughout the course of their shelf lives. Both of these approaches can help reduce waste due to spoilage.",0
Lowering the Minimum Donation Amount Increases Consumer Purchase Likelihood of Products Associated with Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Both the total amount to be donated and the way it is communicated can influence consumer reactions to cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns. While companies often choose not to explicate any donation limit, this study argues that donation frames (e.g., minimum or maximum total donation) can enhance the likelihood of consumer purchases associated with CM campaigns. In a series of four studies, the authors find that consumers often respond more favorably to minimum-frame CM campaigns with a relatively low donation amount (e.g., at least $100,000 will be donated) than those with a high donation amount (e.g., at least $10 million will be donated) despite the superiority of the latter for the recipient cause. This effect is inverted for maximum donation frames, such that a high donation amount leads to greater consumer participation. This research also demonstrates that this effect is driven by the consumer desire to make a personal contribution to a cause, which is more likely to be observed when consumers endow it with high importance. These effects are obtained with attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual expenditures.",1
"Social Networks, Personalized Advertising, and Privacy Controls",Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"This article investigates how Internet users? perceptions of control over their personal information affect how likely they are to click on online advertising on a social networking website. The analysis uses data from a randomized field experiment that examined the effectiveness of personalizing ad text with user-posted personal information relative to generic text. The website gave users more control over their personally identifiable information in the middle of the field test. However, the website did not change how advertisers used data to target and personalize ads. Before the policy change, personalized ads did not perform particularly well. However, after this enhancement of perceived control over privacy, users were nearly twice as likely to click on personalized ads. Ads that targeted but did not use personalized text remained unchanged in effectiveness. The increase in effectiveness was larger for ads that used more unique private information to personalize their message and for target groups that were more likely to use opt-out privacy settings.",1
Customer Satisfaction and Stock Returns Risk,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Over the past decade, several studies have argued that customer satisfaction has high relevance for financial markets because it has a significant impact on stock returns. However, little attention has been given to understanding the impact of customer satisfaction on the risk of stock returns. The finance literature suggests that investors that judge performance only in terms of returns place more resources than warranted in risky opportunities, forgo profitable opportunities, and apply misguided performance evaluations. Accordingly, this study develops, tests, and finds empirical support for the hypotheses that positive changes (i.e., improvement) in customer satisfaction result in negative changes (i.e., reduction) in overall and downside systematic and idiosyncratic risk. Using a panel data sample of publicly traded U.S. firms and satisfaction data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the study demonstrates that investments in customer satisfaction insulate a firm's stock returns from market movements (overall and downside systematic risk) and lower the volatility of its stock returns (overall and downside idiosyncratic risk). The results are robust to alternative measures of risk, model specifications, and concerns related to sample composition criteria raised in some recent studies. Therefore, the results indicate that customer satisfaction is a metric that provides valuable information to financial markets. The robust impact of customer satisfaction on stock returns risk indicates that it would be useful for firms to disclose their customer satisfaction scores in their annual report to shareholders.",0
Ties that Bind: The Impact of Multiple Types of Ties with a Customeron Sales Growth and Sales Volatility,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Suppliers in business-to-business settings are increasingly building a portfolio of multiple types of ties with individual customers. For example, in addition to supplying goods and services, a supplier may have a research-and-development alliance and a marketing alliance with a customer. This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The findings from panel data on supplier?customer relationships suggest that an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, among other methodological concerns. These findings have clear implications for managing multiple types of ties with a customer and indicate that relationship multiplexity is a valuable nonfinancial metric.",1
Rethinking Customer Solutions: From Product Bundles to Relational Processes,Journal of Marketing,2007,"This study draws on depth interviews with 49 managers in customer firms and 55 managers in supplier firms and on discussions with 21 managers in two focus groups to propose a new way of thinking about customer solutions. Extant literature and suppliers interviewed for this study view a solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and services for meeting a customer's business needs. In contrast, customers view a solution as a set of customer?supplier relational processes comprising (1) customer requirements definition, (2) customization and integration of goods and/or services and (3) their deployment, and (4) postdeployment customer support, all of which are aimed at meeting customers' business needs. The relational process view can help suppliers deliver more effective solutions at profitable prices. In addition, field research suggests that the effectiveness of a solution depends not only on supplier variables but also on several customer variables. Supplier variables include contingent hierarchy, documentation emphasis, incentive externality, customer interactor stability, and process articulation. Customer variables include adaptiveness to supplier offerings and political and operational counseling that a customer provides to a supplier. Several of these variables underscore the importance of suppliers developing social capital with customers. The authors discuss implications for solution suppliers and identify areas for further research.",0
Authority Relinquishment in Agency Relationships,Journal of Marketing,2016,"A key decision for the design of principal?agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal?agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as ?authority relinquishment.? Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships?formal authority and authority decentralization.",0
A Near-Optimal Bidding Strategy for Real-Time Display Advertising Auctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This article introduces a near-optimal bidding algorithm for use in real-time display advertising auctions. These auctions constitute a dominant distribution channel for internet display advertising and a potential funding model for addressable media. The proposed efficient, implementable learning algorithm is proven to rapidly converge to the optimal strategy while achieving zero regret and constituting a competitive equilibrium. This is the first algorithmic solution to the online knapsack problem to offer such theoretical guarantees without assuming a priori knowledge of object values or costs. Furthermore, it meets advertiser requirements by accommodating any valuation metric while satisfying budget constraints. Across a series of 100 simulated and 10 real-world campaigns, the algorithm delivers 98% of the value achievable with perfect foresight and outperforms the best available alternative by 11%. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be augmented to simultaneously estimate impression values and learn the bidding policy. Across a series of simulations, we show that the total regret delivered under this dual objective is less than that from any competing algorithm required only to learn the bidding policy.",1
Do Strategic Conclusions Depend on how Price is Defined in Models of Distribution Channels?,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Models of distribution channels have defined retailer and manufacturer pricing decision variables in different ways, such as absolute retail price or absolute retail margin and absolute manufacturer price or absolute manufacturer margin. This article examines whether this choice of definition affects the equilibrium outcomes from such models. It shows that the equilibrium outcomes do not change with these definitions if manufacturers are modeled as Stackelberg pricing leaders to their retailer. However, if manufacturers are modeled as Bertrand-Nash competitors to their retailer or as Stackelberg pricing followers to their retailer, the equilibrium outcomes change depending on how the retailer's pricing decision variables are defined. Moreover, if in these two cases manufacturers and retailer are allowed to define their own pricing decision variables, then (1) manufacturers are indifferent about choosing among absolute prices, absolute margins, and percentage margins, but (2) the retailer chooses percentage margins. These results have implications for both theoretical and empirical models of price competition in distribution channels.",1
Value-Based Differentiation in Business Relationships: Gaining and Sustaining Key Supplier Status,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Many business customers today consolidate their supply bases and implement preferred supplier programs. Consequently, vendors increasingly face the alternative of either gaining a key supplier status with their customers or being pushed into the role of a backup supplier. As product and price become less important differentiators, suppliers of routinely purchased products search for new ways to differentiate themselves in a buyer?seller relationship. This research investigates avenues for differentiation through value creation in business-to-business relationships. The results suggest that relationship benefits display a stronger potential for differentiation in key supplier relationships than cost considerations. The authors identify service support and personal interaction as core differentiators, followed by a supplier's know-how and its ability to improve a customer's time to market. Product quality and delivery performance, along with acquisition costs and operation costs, display a moderate potential to help a firm gain and maintain key supplier status. Finally, price shows the weakest potential for differentiation.",0
Hybrid Offerings: How Manufacturing Firms Combine Goods and Services Successfully,Journal of Marketing,2011,"This article examines key success factors for designing and delivering combinations of goods and services (i.e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource?capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers? positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers.",0
Consumer Evaluations of Bi-National Products in the Global Market,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"The global market today is characterized by the proliferation of binational products, or products that are branded in one country while actually manufactured in another. This paper investigates how consumers evaluate the quality of such products under two different situations. In Study 1, where brand name and country-of-manufacture were the only pieces of information given about a product, it was found that consumers used both pieces of information in evaluating the product. In Study 2, however, where specific attribute product information was available as well as brand name and country-of-manufacture, it was revealed that consumers relied heavily on the brand name information. The implications of the results for marketing, manufacturing, and sourcing strategies are discussed.",0
"Categories Create Mind-Sets: The Effect of Exposure to Broad versus Narrow Categorizations on Subsequent, Unrelated Decisions",Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors find that exposure to different types of categories or assortments in a task creates a mind-set that changes how consumers process information in subsequent tasks. That is, these mind-sets have a spillover effect that alters consumers' decision making in a variety of subsequent and unrelated tasks, from basic cognitive behaviors (e.g., grouping) and consumer decisions (e.g., new product adoptions) to more general decision-making strategies (e.g., susceptibility to heuristics). Consumers previously exposed to broad assortments or categorizations base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those made salient by the environment. In contrast, consumers previously exposed to narrow assortments or categorizations employ multiple pieces of information, both salient and nonsalient, without exerting any extra effort. Consequently, prior exposure to broad versus narrow categorizations leads to greater susceptibility to some common context effects and to heuristic decision making.",1
Personal Relevance and Mental Simulation Amplify the Duration Framing Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days) can influence consumers? impressions of subjective duration, thereby affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames.",1
The Benefit of Becoming Friends: Complaining after Service Failures Leads Customers with Strong Ties to Increase Loyalty,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Service firms spend considerable resources soliciting complaints to initiate recovery efforts and improve their offerings. However, managers may be overlooking the fact that complaints serve an equally important role in engendering loyalty. The authors demonstrate that the strength of social ties between customers and service providers influences the degree to which complaining drives loyalty. Paradoxically, while strongly tied customers fear that complaining threatens their ties with the provider, when they are encouraged to complain, their loyalty increases because offering feedback serves as an effective way to preserve social ties. Conversely, for weakly tied customers, complaining has no effect on loyalty. Furthermore, complaints are more effective in driving loyalty for strongly tied customers when the feedback is directed toward the provider who failed, rather than to an entity external to the failure. Finally, when providers signal an authentic openness to feedback, strongly tied customers are more loyal after complaining, whereas authenticity does little to engender loyalty for weakly tied customers who complain. The value of complaints in driving loyalty is promising both for customers who perceive a strong tie to a particular provider within the firm and, more generally, in service industries wherein strong ties naturally occur.",0
?Listening In? to Find and Explore New Combinations of Customer Needs,Journal of Marketing,2004,"By ?listening in? to ongoing dialogues between customers and Web-based virtual advisers (e.g., Kelley Blue Book's Auto Choice Advisor), the authors identify new product opportunities based on new combinations of customer needs. The data are available at little incremental cost and provide the scale necessary for complex products (e.g., 148 trucks and 129 customer needs in the authors? application). The authors describe and evaluate the methodologies with formal analysis, Monte Carlo simulation (calibrated on real data), and a ?proof-of-concept? application in the pickup-truck category (more than 1000 Web-based respondents). The application identified opportunities for new truck platforms worth approximately $2.4 billion?$3.2 billion and $1 billion?$2 billion, respectively.",0
Scope Insensitivity and the ?Mere Token? Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Decisions often involve trade-offs between a more normative option and a less normative but more tempting one. The authors propose that the intrapersonal conflict that is evoked by choices involving incompatible goals can be resolved through scope-insensitive justifications. The authors describe one such mechanism, the ?mere token? effect, a new phenomenon in decision making. They demonstrate that adding a certain and immediate mere token amount to both options increases choices of the later-larger option in intertemporal choice and of the riskier-larger option in risky choice. The authors find this effect to be scope insensitive, such that the size of the token amount does not moderate the effect. They show that intrapersonal choice conflict underlies the mere token effect and that reducing the degree of conflict by increasing the psychological distance to the choice outcomes debiases the effect. Moreover, they show that the mere token effect is enhanced when (1) opposing goals in choice are made salient and (2) the choice options represent a starker contrast that generates greater conflict. The authors empirically rule out alternative explanations, including diminishing marginal utility, normative and descriptive utility-based models, liquidity constraints, and naive diversification. They discuss the direct implications of the mere token effect for the marketing of financial services and, more generally, for consumer preference toward bundles and multiattribute products.",1
"An Empirical Examination of the ?Rule of Three?: Strategy Implications for Top Management, Marketers, and Investors",Journal of Marketing,2010,"This study represents the first empirical examination of the ?Rule of Three,? a theory at odds with several popular notions regarding industry structure and business performance, including the positive linear market share?performance relationship. In general, the findings from more than 160 industries support the Rule of Three and provide five main insights: First, there appears to be a prevalent competitive structure for mature industries in which three ?generalist? firms control the market. Second, industries that conform to this structure tend to perform better than industries with a fewer or greater number of generalists. Third, both ?specialists? and generalists outperform firms that are ?stuck in the middle.? Fourth, the performance benefits of market leadership appear to diminish with excessive market share. Fifth, the Rule of Three industry structure and its influence over firm profitability do not appear to be priced appropriately by financial markets. The authors discuss the implications for multiple stakeholders.",0
Self-Regulatory Strength and Consumers? Relinquishment of Decision Control: When Less Effortful Decisions Are More Resource Depleting,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Using the self-regulatory strength model and prior research on self-esteem threats, the authors predict and show that delegating decisions to surrogates (e.g., financial advisors, physicians) depletes consumers? limited self-regulatory resources more than making the same decisions independently, thus impairing their subsequent ability to exercise self-control. This is the case even though decision delegation actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their belief in free will (Study 2). Moreover, when people remember a past decision that they delegated, their self-control is impaired more than when they remember a decision made independently (Studies 3 and 4). The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",1
A Dynamic Process of Building Global Supply Chain Competence by New Ventures: The Case of Uniqlo,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"In today's volatile global marketplace, firms should pursue flexible asset distribution and high-quality, low-cost manufacturing operations simultaneously. Previous studies have examined the relationships between supplier management?related variables and market performance with cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First, Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time. Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third, Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global supply chain development.",0
Product Ethnicity: Revisiting the Match between Products and Countries,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"Consumers make stereotypical associations between products and countries based on their perceptions of a country's know-how and reputation relative to the design, manufacturing, or branding of particular generic goods. When such associations are shared globally, they reflect product ethnicity, a concept that the authors empirically explore in this article. Operationalization of product ethnicity is based on country?product associations that consumers make with either a product or a country as the initial stimulus, resulting in a combined two-way measurement. The authors first investigate product ethnicity at an exploratory level across five survey countries for a large set of products and countries (Study 1). They identify what they term ?context-centered association tendencies? because respondents tend to associate goods more closely with their own country. The authors then relate product ethnicity and context-centered association tendencies to the country-of-origin literature and test research hypotheses with a new set of countries (Study 2), comprising two collectivist cultures (China and Mexico) and two individualist cultures (Germany and the United States). Finally, Study 3 shows that consumers are more willing to buy product offerings that are congruent rather than noncongruent with product ethnicity.",0
Decision Process Evolution in Customer Channel Choice,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The growing number of sales channels through which customers can make purchases has made it imperative for managers to understand how customers decide which channels to use. However, this presents a significant challenge because there is reason to believe the channel decision process evolves over the lifetime of the customer. The authors document the existence and nature of this phenomenon by analyzing the evolution of a customer's channel choice decision process from a trial stage to a posttrial stage. First, they analyze data for a book retailer and replicate their analysis using data from a durables and apparel retailer. Their results suggest that (1) customers? decision processes do evolve, (2) a minority but sizeable segment changes decision processes within the observation period, and (3) customers who change do so from a decision process in which they are highly responsive to marketing to one in which they are less responsive. The authors illustrate and discuss the implications for both managers and researchers.",0
Contingent Response to Self-Customization Procedures: Implications for Decision Satisfaction and Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Self-customization is the process by which consumers seek to customize offerings to their own preferences. In this article, the authors propose that differences in self-customization procedures potentially influence (1) the product configuration favored, (2) the degree of decision difficulty in product customization, (3) the degree of satisfaction with the customized option, and (4) the degree of willingness to purchase. The authors examine these propositions in a series of studies that allow self-customization through the use of either a by-attribute or a by-alternative method. They show that consumers tend to choose an intermediate (compromise) option significantly more often when they customize a product using the by-attribute method than when using the by-alternative method. In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics. These results can aid marketing managers in designing mass-customization procedures.",1
The Positive Effect of Not Following Others on Social Media,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Marketers commonly seed information about products and brands through individuals believed to be influential on social media, which often involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who have subscribed to see that individual?s posts). Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on social media are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user?s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater autonomy, a signal of influence in the eyes of others.",1
Informants in Organizational Marketing Research: Why Use Multiple Informants and how to Aggregate Responses,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Organizational research frequently involves seeking judgmental response data from informants within organizations. This article discusses why using multiple informants improves the quality of response data and thereby the validity of research findings. The authors show that when there are multiple informants who disagree, responses aggregated with confidence- or competence-based weights outperform those with response data-based weights, which in turn provide significant gains in estimation accuracy over simply averaging informant reports. The proposed methods are effective, inexpensive, and easy to use in organizational marketing research.",1
Embodied Myopia,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"One field study and five experiments show that seemingly irrelevant bodily actions influence consumer behavior. These studies demonstrate that arm flexion (in which the motor action is directed toward the self) versus arm extension (in which the motor action is directed away from the self) influences purchase behavior, product preferences, and economic decisions. More specifically, arm flexion increases the likelihood of purchasing vice products (Study 1a), leads to a preference for vices over virtues (Studies 1b and 2a), and leads to preference for smaller, sooner over larger, later monetary rewards (Studies 2b, 3, and 4). The authors argue that arm flexion induces present-biased preferences through activation of approach motivation. The effect of bodily actions on present-biased preferences is regulated by the behavioral approach system (Studies 3 and 4) and relies on the learned association between arm flexion and activation of this approach system (Study 4). The authors discuss implications for intertemporal decision making, embodied cognition, and marketing practice.",1
How Customer Referral Programs Turn Social Capital into Economic Capital,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer?referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.",1
The Clash of the Titans: On Retailer and Manufacturer Vulnerability in Conflict Delistings,Journal of Marketing,2017,"The days of dominant manufacturers dictating the game to obedient retailers are long gone. When parties believe they have equal bargaining power, negotiations end in deadlock more frequently and result in conflict delistings wherein the manufacturers? brands get removed from the retailers? assortments. This might cause major sales losses as consumers are forced to change stores or brands. The authors study both parties? vulnerabilities by investigating their market share shifts during a highly publicized real-life conflict delisting executed by a major retailer against a major manufacturer, involving multiple brands and categories. Generally, both parties lost sales, yet the retailer was the most vulnerable party. Manufacturer-brand and retailer-assortment characteristics moderated both parties? vulnerability: the manufacturer and retailer became respectively less and more vulnerable when a high-equity brand was delisted in a small assortment. Both parties lost more in necessity than in impulse categories. The authors additionally investigate long-term consequences that occurred after the conflict was settled: the retailer's market share recovered to the predelisting level, whereas the manufacturer's share underwent a long-term level rise.",0
Dynamic and Competitive Effects of Direct Mailings: A Charitable Giving Application,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors propose a dynamic direct mailing response model with competitive effects. Purchase and promotion history are incorporated to map the dynamic competitive interactions among the firms sending the mailings. The authors investigate the impact of direct mailings on the revenues of each firm and its competitors over time. The model accounts for endogeneity of the mailing decision and for unobserved heterogeneity across households. The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities. In the long run, these effects die out. The results are also interpreted from a behavioral perspective.",1
Critical Incidents and the Impact of Satisfaction on Customer Share,Journal of Marketing,2008,"In business markets, the long-term nature of relationships may prompt parties to conduct ?business as usual,? but negative critical incidents (CIs) can cause a destabilization of these long-term relationships. The authors develop a comprehensive dynamic model of customer loyalty to account for the impact of negative CIs on both the nature and the magnitude of the relationships between satisfaction and customer share. The results indicate that CIs trigger a stronger updating of the customer relationship, which moves customers from a business-as-usual mind-set to a reconsideration of the relationship. Furthermore, nonlinearities in the relationships are much more pronounced in the presence of CIs. Depending on the relationship quality, CIs have different consequences for customer relationships, and if relationship quality is high, a negative CI can even have a positive impact on customer share.",0
Modeling Global Spillover of New Product Takeoff,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article examines the global spillover of foreign product introductions and takeoffs on a focal country's time to takeoff, using a novel data set of penetration data for eight high-tech products across 55 countries. It shows how foreign clout, the susceptibility to foreign influences, and intercountry distances affect global spillover patterns. The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions, accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country, the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects. Cross-country spillover effects are stronger the closer the countries are to one another, both geographically and economically, but not necessarily in terms of culture. The model the authors develop also quantifies the spillover between each country pair, allowing it to be asymmetric.",1
Gear Manufacturers as Contestants in Sports Competitions: Breeding and Branding Returns,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Several manufacturers make substantial investments to compete in sports contests, using the gear they develop and market. However, no systematic analysis of the breeding (i.e., innovation) and branding (i.e., marketing) returns from such investments exists. In this study, the authors conceptualize and empirically estimate the breeding and branding returns that such manufacturers obtain. The authors gather data for 30 car brands of 16 manufacturers over the period 2000?2015 regarding their participation, spending, and performance in Formula One championships, annual patent citations, and research-and-development (R&D) budgets as well as monthly vehicle registrations, advertising expenditures, and Formula One TV viewership. The authors find that only gear manufacturers with relatively high levels of R&D spending obtain a positive and significant breeding return from competing in sports contests. While most brands obtain positive branding returns, the lower the level of advertising spending for the brand, the greater the branding returns they obtain from competing in these contests. Thus, research-intense (compared with advertising-intense) gear manufacturers have more to gain from competing in sports contests. These findings can help guide manufacturers in budget allocation decisions on sports competitions, R&D, and advertising.",0
The Rise of Online Grocery Shopping in China: Which Brands Will Benefit?,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Online grocery in China is on the rise. With large differences in brands? abilities to secure a portion of China?s online pie, a key question is what drives these differences. The authors derive how a brand?s total sales change as the online grocery share goes up, and they show that it depends on two indices: (1) the brand?s online index (brand?s online category share relative to its offline category share) and (2) the category?s online index (category?s grocery share online relative to its grocery share offline). The authors then identify brand and category factors that drive these indices. They estimate their model on 448 brands in 60 product categories in China using 2011?2015 data. Their analyses show that the brand online index mainly increases with higher levels of online availability, lower online-to-offline price ratios, and for ?trusted,? less ?fun? brands. As for the category online index, expensive, less frequently bought categories benefit from the shift toward the online channel, whereas the opposite holds for perishable and heavy categories.",0
Decomposing the Promotional Revenue Bump for Loyalty Program Members versus Nonmembers,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Loyalty programs lead to a natural split of a firm's customer base into members and nonmembers. To manage both groups effectively, it is essential to know how marketing activities, such as promotions, affect both groups' contributions to revenues. The authors model each group's contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy. Thus, the decomposition of the promotional revenue bump is strongly moderated by the percentage price discount and the communication mode: direct mail to members only and door-to-door flyers to members and nonmembers.",1
Winners and Losers in a Major Price War,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Although retail price wars have received much business press and some research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and long-term effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity. The authors provide managerial implications for firms that are (or about to be) involved in a price war.",1
"Fanning the Flames? how Media Coverage of a Price War Affects Retailers, Consumers, and Investors",Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This article explores how media coverage of a price war affects customer, retailer, and investor reactions over time. Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003?2005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.",1
Price and Advertising Effectiveness over the Business Cycle,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Firms are under increasing pressure to justify their marketing expenditures. This evolution toward greater accountability is reinforced in harsh economic times when marketing budgets are among the first to be reconsidered. To make such decisions, managers must know whether, and to what extent, marketing's effectiveness varies with the economic tide; however, surprisingly little research addresses this issue. Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and long-term advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger. Finally, patterns differ across categories and brands, which presents opportunities for firms that know how to ride the economic tide.",1
"Is 75% of the Sales Promotion Bump Due to Brand Switching? No, Only 33% Is",Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"Several researchers have decomposed sales promotion elasticities based on household scanner-panel data. A key result is that the majority of the sales promotion elasticity, approximately 74% on average, is attributed to secondary demand effects (brand switching) and the remainder is attributed to primary demand effects (timing acceleration and quantity increases). The authors demonstrate that this result does not imply that if a brand gains 100 units in sales during a promotion, the other brands in the category lose 74 units. The authors offer a complementary decomposition measure based on unit sales. The measure shows the ratio of the current cross-brand unit sales loss to the current own-brand unit sales gain during promotion; the authors report empirical results for this measure. They also derive analytical expressions that transform the elasticity decomposition into a decomposition of unit sales effects. These expressions show the nature of the difference between the two decompositions. To gain insight into the magnitude of the difference, the authors apply these expressions to previously reported elasticity decomposition results and find that approximately 33% of the unit sales increase is attributable to losses incurred by other brands in the same category.",1
The Estimation of Pre- and Postpromotion Dips with Store-Level Scanner Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"One of the mysteries of store-level scanner data modeling is the lack of a dip in sales in the weeks following a promotion. Researchers expect to find a postpromotion dip because analyses of household scanner panel data indicate that consumers tend to accelerate their purchases in response to a promotion?that is, they buy earlier and/or purchase larger quantities than they would in the absence of a promotion. Thus, there should also be a pronounced dip in store-level sales in the weeks following a promotion. However, researchers rarely find such dips at either the category or the brand level. Several arguments have been proposed to account for the lack of a postpromotion dip in store-level sales data and to explain why dips may be hidden. Because dips are difficult to detect by traditional models (and by a visual inspection of the data), the authors propose models that can account for a multitude of factors that together cause complex pre- and postpromotion dips. The authors use three alternative distributed lead and lag structures: an Almon model, an unrestricted dynamic effects model, and an exponential decay model. In each model, the authors include four types of price discounts: without any support, with display-only support, with feature-only support, and with feature and display support. The models are calibrated on store-level scanner data for two product categories: tuna and toilet tissue. The authors estimate the dip to be between 4 and 25% of the current sales effect, which is consistent with household-level studies.",1
Semiparametric Analysis to Estimate the Deal Effect Curve,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The marketing literature suggests several phenomena that may contribute to the nature of the relationship between sales and price discounts. These phenomena can produce complex nonlinearities and interactions in the deal effect curve that are best captured with a flexible approach. Because a fully nonparametric regression model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose a semiparametric regression model. Store-level sales over time are modeled as a non-parametric function of own- and cross-item price discounts and a parametric function of other predictors. The authors compare the predictive validity of the semiparametric model with that of two parametric benchmark models and obtain superior performance. The results for three product categories indicate threshold and saturation effects for both own-and cross-item temporary price cuts. The authors also find that the nature of the own-item curve depends on other items' price discounts. Comparisons with restricted model specifications show that both the flexible main effects and flexible interaction effects contribute to the superior results for the semiparametric approach. The interaction effects are so complex that it is unlikely for any parametric model to be satisfactory. In a separate analysis, the authors illustrate how the shape of the deal effect curve depends on own-item promotion signals. There is a crossover interaction effect: For the item analyzed, feature advertising produces a higher sales effect up to a 20% discount, whereas display achieves higher sales for discounts in excess of 20%.",1
The Dynamic Effect of Innovation on Market Structure,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Product innovation is endemic among consumer packaged goods firms and is an integral component of their marketing strategy. As innovations affect markets, there is a pressing need to develop market response models that can adapt to such changes. The authors' model copes with the challenges that dynamic environments entail: nonstationarity, changes in parameters over time, missing data, and cross-sectional heterogeneity. They use this approach to model sales response in the frozen pizza category, in which the introduction of rising-crust pizza brands represents a major innovation. The model is directly applicable to other domains in which market structure might be nonstationary, such as changes in promotion strategy, shifts in the retail environment, and movements in macroeconomic factors. The authors find that innovation (1) makes the existing brands appear more similar, as indicated by increasing cross-brand price elasticities; (2) decreases brand differentiation for the existing brands, as indicated by an increase in the magnitude of own-brand price elasticities; and (3) increases the variance of the sales response equations temporarily around the time of the introduction of the innovation, indicating increased uncertainty in sales response. The authors discuss the managerial implications by presenting maps of how clout and vulnerability evolve over time, assessing the effect of new brands on cannibalization, and considering the strategic implications of the introduction of a flanker innovation to facilitate an extant brand's ability to attack an incumbent leader.",1
When High-Similarity Copycats Lose and Moderate-Similarity Copycats Gain: The Impact of Comparative Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Copycats imitate features of leading brands to free ride on their equity. The prevailing belief is that the more similar copycats are to the leader brand, the more positive their evaluation is, and thus the more they free ride. Three studies demonstrate when the reverse holds true: Moderate-similarity copycats are actually evaluated more positively than high-similarity copycats when evaluation takes place comparatively, such as when the leader brand is present rather than absent. The results demonstrate that blatant copycats can be less and subtle copycats can be more perilous than is commonly believed. This finding has implications for marketing theory and practice and trademark law.",1
Cumulative Timed Intent: A New Predictive Tool for Technology Adoption,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves?curves calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time intervals across a fixed horizon?of 478 managerial decision makers, self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology. A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years. The results hold great promise for further research on using and optimizing cumulative timed intent measures across a variety of application domains.",1
Trying Harder and Doing Worse: How Grocery Shoppers Track In-Store Spending,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Although almost one in three U.S. households shops on a budget, it remains unclear whether and how shoppers track their in-store spending to stay within those budgets. A field study and two laboratory studies offer four key generalizations about budget shoppers in grocery stores: (1) They predominantly use mental computation strategies to track their in-store spending, (2) they adapt their mental computation strategy to the dominant range of price endings of items in their shopping baskets, (3) those who try to calculate the exact total price of their basket are less accurate than those who estimate the approximate price, and (4) motivated shoppers are less accurate than less motivated shoppers (because they tend to calculate rather than estimate the total basket price). A second field study demonstrates that shoppers who underestimate the total price of their basket are more likely to overspend, leading to negative store satisfaction.",0
Smart Shopping Carts: How Real-Time Feedback Influences Spending,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Although interest in smart shopping carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups have concerns about how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained (?budget? shoppers) or not (?nonbudget? shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers.",0
Shopper Loyalty to Whom? Chain versus Outlet Loyalty in the Context of Store Acquisitions,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"When patronizing stores, consumers may exhibit loyalty not only to a retail chain but also to a specific outlet. This distinction is important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership, chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a model of consumers? reactions to store acquisitions. The authors estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering ñ200 local markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition, consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach. Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a hard discounter, in which case customers? previous store knowledge is less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater.",1
Retrieving Unobserved Consideration Sets from Household Panel Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors propose a new model to capture unobserved consideration from discrete choice data. This approach allows for unobserved dependence in consideration among brands, easily copes with many brands, and accommodates different effects of the marketing mix on consideration and choice as well as unobserved consumer heterogeneity in both processes. An important goal of this study is to establish the validity of the existing practice to infer consideration sets from observed choices in panel data. The authors show with experimental data that underlying consideration sets can be reliably retrieved from choice data alone and that consideration is positively affected by display and shelf space. Next, the model is applied to Information Resources Inc. panel data. The findings suggest that promotion effects are larger when they are included in the consideration stage of the two-stage model than in a single-stage model. The authors also find that consideration covaries across brands and that this covariation is mainly driven by unobserved consumer heterogeneity. Finally, the authors show the implications of the model for promotion planning relative to a more standard model of choice.",1
Identifying Response Styles: A Latent-Class Bilinear Multinomial Logit Model,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Respondents can vary strongly in the way they use rating scales. Specifically, respondents can exhibit a variety of response styles, which threatens the validity of the responses. The purpose of this article is to investigate how response style and content of the items affect rating scale responses. The authors develop a novel model that accounts for different types of response styles, content of items, and background characteristics of respondents. By imposing a bilinear parameter structure on a multinomial logit model, the authors graphically distinguish the effects on the response behavior of the characteristics of a respondent and the content of an item. The authors combine this approach with finite mixture modeling, yielding two segmentations of the respondents: one for response style and one for item content. They apply this latent-class bilinear multinomial logit model to the well-known List of Values in a cross-national context. The results show large differences in the opinions and the response styles of respondents and reveal previously unknown response styles. Some response styles appear to be valid communication styles, whereas other response styles often concur with inconsistent opinions of the items and seem to be response bias.",1
Advance Ordering for Healthier Eating? Field Experiments on the Relationship between the Meal Order?Consumption Time Delay and Meal Content,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Encouraging consumers to select meals in advance rather than at mealtime has been proposed as a strategy to promote healthier eating decisions, taking advantage of the improved self-control that is thought to accompany decisions about the future. In two field studies at an employee cafeteria and a third in a university setting, we examine how time delays between placing a lunch order and picking it up affect the healthfulness of that lunch. The first study, a secondary data analysis, finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed orders. The third study compares orders for truly immediate consumption versus orders placed in advance and demonstrates a significant (100 calorie, or approximately 10%) reduction in lunch calories. We discuss evidence regarding possible theoretical mechanisms underlying this effect, as well as practical implications of our findings.",1
"The Impact of National Culture, Business Scope, and Geographic Location on Joint Venture Operations in China",Journal of International Marketing,1997,"This study describes operational experiences in 73 equity joint ventures (EJVs) in China. Key difficulties are identified in the areas of local sourcing, recruitment of skilled Chinese managers, and the clarity of laws and regulations. Although interesting and meaningful differences are identified across ventures, the analyses indicate that these three operational aspects are serious and problematic irrespective of geographic location of the EJV in China, its business scope, and the national culture of the foreign partner. Neither location, nor industry, nor ethnic relation among partners shields the EJV against the most problematic operational concerns. Given their structural and cultural origins, these operational difficulties are likely to remain a headache for foreign managers operating in China in the near future.",0
Measuring the Price Knowledge Shoppers Bring to the Store,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Reference price research suggests that consumers memorize and recall price information when selecting brands for frequently purchased products. Previous price-knowledge surveys, however, indicate that memory for prices is lower than expected. In this study, the authors show that these price-knowledge surveys provide imperfect estimates of price knowledge, because they focus only on recall and short-term memory. The authors propose, instead, to use a combination of price recall, price recognition, and deal recognition to measure the degree to which consumers use auditory verbal, visual Arabic, or analogue magnitude representations to memorize prices. The authors show how the combination of these three measures provides a much richer understanding of consumers' knowledge of prices. The results suggest that the price knowledge involved in reference prices may often not be accessible to recall but shows up in price recognition and deal recognition. In addition, the authors identify consumer and product characteristics that explain the variations in price knowledge. They find, for example, that frequent promotions increase consumers' ability to remember regular prices and that store switchers do not possess better price knowledge than other shoppers.",0
Strategic Interdependence in Organizations: Deconglomeration and Marketing Strategy,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Although strategy exists at multiple levels in a firm (corporate, business, and functional), there is a dearth of research in marketing literature that focuses on the dependency among strategy at different levels. The authors address this issue by examining the relationship between deconglomeration and marketing strategy. Deconglomeration refers to the divestiture behavior of a conglomerate firm and the transformation of its business portfolio from one that is largely composed of several unrelated businesses to one composed of fewer and related businesses. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, the authors propose a conceptual model delineating the environmental and organizational drivers of deconglomeration and its outcomes for marketing. The authors suggest that after deconglomeration, (1) a firm can be expected to be more competitor and customer oriented, (2) multimarket contact with competing firms and seller concentration will increase, (3) businesses retained by the firm will be more innovative and place greater emphasis on advertising compared with sales promotion, and (4) the firm's culture may become more externally oriented. Furthermore, the locus of decision making for marketing strategy may shift more toward senior management levels. In summary, changes in a firm's corporate strategy could lead to significant changes in the marketing strategy of its business units.",0
"Toward Sustainability: Public Policy, Global Social Innovations for Base-of-the-Pyramid Markets, and Demarketing for a Better World",Journal of International Marketing,2014,"In numerous country markets (particularly emerging and less developed markets), inadequate and/or ineffective investments in infrastructure and the resultant quantity and quality gaps in public goods (e.g., water, electricity, sanitation, public transportation) often require consumers to engage in ecologically harmful consumption behaviors that are inconsistent with their prosustainability attitudes and values. Quantity and quality gaps in public goods also have major social and economic consequences because they necessitate consumers at the base of the market pyramid to spend significant portions of their income to purchase substantially higher-priced substitute private goods. This article presents a framework of the interdependencies among public policy actions, quantity and quality gaps in public goods, abnormal demand for certain broad types of unsustainability-accentuating products (intrinsically zero demand, intrinsically lower demand, and ecologically more harmful substitute products), sustainability-facilitating consumption behaviors (consumption elimination, reduction, and redirection), and sustainability-facilitating demand effects (demand elimination, reduction, and redirection). Implications for public policy actions, global social innovations for base-of-the-pyramid markets, demarketing, and opportunities for further research are discussed.",0
Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Marketing inherited a model of exchange from economics, which had a dominant logic based on the exchange of ?goods,? which usually are manufactured output. The dominant logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.",0
The Augmented Latent Class Model: Incorporating Additional Heterogeneity in the Latent Class Model for Panel Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Marketing researchers have actively sought to account for the heterogeneity in households' preferences and responses to marketing-mix elements (e.g., price, promotion) when analyzing scanner-panel data. This is because not doing so biases response coefficient estimates that can potentially alter the conclusions drawn from such analyses. In this article, the authors present an extension to the latent class model (LCM) that accounts for additional heterogeneity by allowing households' preferences to be a continuous mixture of segment-level preferences. The authors show how their model generalizes the LCM by the mere addition of S + 1 parameters, where S refers to the number of segments. Because a limitation of the traditional LCM is that it does not adequately account for heterogeneity in responses across households, the authors' model mitigates this criticism leveled at the LCM. They then compare their model with the traditional LCM and the equivalent continuous mixture (random-effects) models in terms of model selection criteria and predictive ability. The results indicate that the authors' model outperforms both the LCM and the equivalent random-effects (logit) model on these criteria.",1
Modeling Fuzzy Data in Qualitative Marketing Research,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"In marketing, qualitative data are used in theory development to investigate marketing phenomena in more depth. After qualitative data are collected, the judgment-based classification of items into categories is routinely used to summarize and communicate the information contained in the data. In this article, the authors provide marketing researchers with a method that (1) provides useful substantive information about the proportion and degree to which items belong to several categories and (2) measures the classification accuracy of the judges. The model is called the fuzzy latent class model (FLCM), because it extends Dillon and Mulani's (1984) latent class model by freeing it from the restrictive assumption that all items are crisp for a given categorization. Instead, FLCM allows for items to be either crisp or fuzzy. Crisp items belong exclusively to one category, whereas fuzzy items belong?in varying degree?to multiple categories. This relaxation in the assumption about the nature of qualitative data makes FLCM more widely applicable: Qualitative data in marketing research are often fuzzy, because they involve open-ended descriptions of complex phenomena. The authors also propose a moment-based measure of overall data fuzziness that is bounded by 0 (completely crisp) and 1 (completely fuzzy).",1
The Role of Entrepreneurial Networks in the Exploration and Exploitation of Internationalization Opportunities by Information and Communication Technology Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This article investigates the role of entrepreneurial social and business networks in the internationalization of high-technology firms. The authors present case study evidence from born-global information and communication technology firms that shows that established and newly formed social networks can be instrumental in exploring internationalization opportunities. These social networks potentially lead to collaborative cooperation and form part of an entrepreneur's broader business network that facilitates exploitation of internationalization opportunities culminated by successful entry into foreign markets. The study incorporates contemporary literature and offers an internationalization opportunity exploration?exploitation model emanating from the entrepreneur's network configuration. In doing so, it takes a process approach and provides much needed qualitative evidence in network research.",0
Measuring and Managing Returns from Retailer-Customized Coupon Campaigns,Journal of Marketing,2012,"The authors assess how and why retailer-customized coupon campaigns affect customer purchases. The conceptual model proposes effects on trip incidence and revenues through the mere exposure to campaigns (exposure effect) and the redemption of coupons (redemption effect). The authors propose monetary savings of the coupons, regularity of the campaigns, and coupon fit with customer preferences as moderators. Analysis of data from a group of regional grocery chains that were part of a quasi experiment demonstrates that retailer-customized coupon campaigns have a positive exposure and redemption effect on customer purchases. Mere exposure to customized coupon campaigns contributes more than coupon redemption to campaign returns. Consistent with theoretical expectations, customized coupon campaigns are more effective if they provide more discounts, are unexpected, and are positioned as specially selected for and customized to consumer preferences. The substantial exposure effects suggest that managers should look beyond redemption rates and also consider sales lift from nonredeemers when measuring the effectiveness of customized coupon campaigns.",0
A Customer Lifetime Value Framework for Customer Selection and Resource Allocation Strategy,Journal of Marketing,2004,The authors evaluate the usefulness of customer lifetime value (CLV) as a metric for customer selection and marketing resource allocation by developing a dynamic framework that enables managers to maintain or improve customer relationships proactively through marketing contacts across various channels and to maximize CLV simultaneously. The authors show that marketing contacts across various channels influence CLV nonlinearly. Customers who are selected on the basis of their lifetime value provide higher profits in future periods than do customers selected on the basis of several other customer-based metrics. The analyses suggest that there is potential for improved profits when managers design resource allocation rules that maximize CLV. Managers can use the authors? framework to allocate marketing resources efficiently across customers and channels of communication.,0
Optimal Customer Relationship Management Using Bayesian Decision Theory: An Application for Customer Selection,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"This study addresses significant challenges that practitioners face when using customer lifetime value (CLV) for customer selection. First, the authors propose a Bayesian decision theory?based customer selection framework that accommodates the uncertainty inherent in predicting customer behavior. They develop a joint model of purchase timing and quantity that is amenable for selecting customers using CLV. Second, the authors compare performance of the proposed customer selection framework (1) with the current customer selection procedure in the collaborating firm and (2) with different customer-level cost allocation rules that are necessary for computing CLV. The study finds that given a budget constraint, customers selected by means of a Bayesian decision theory?based framework (i.e., using the maximized expected CLV of a customer and the corresponding optimal marketing costs as an estimate of future costs) provide the highest profits. The study provides guidelines for implementation and illustrates how the proposed customer selection framework can aid managers in enhancing marketing productivity and estimating return on marketing actions.",1
Multichannel Shopping: Causes and Consequences,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The authors explore the drivers of multichannel shopping and the impact of multichannel shopping on customer profitability. Through a longitudinal analysis, the authors provide evidence that multichannel shopping is associated with higher customer profitability. Using the social exchange theory, they develop hypotheses regarding the impact of several customer?firm interaction characteristics on customer channel adoption duration. They propose a shared-frailty hazard model for testing the proposed hypotheses. They use the customer database of an apparel manufacturer that sells through three distinct channels for the empirical analysis and find that frequency-related interaction characteristics have the greatest influence on second-channel adoption duration. In contrast, proportion of returns, a purchase-related interaction characteristic, has the greatest influence on third-channel adoption duration. Variation across customers in purchase-related attributes has a greater impact on the duration to adopt the second channel than the duration to adopt the third channel. In contrast, variation across customers in the channel-related attributes has a greater impact on the third-channel adoption duration than on the second-channel adoption duration. The customer?firm interaction characteristics identified in this study and the proposed model framework allow for forward-looking allocation of multichannel marketing resources.",0
Predicting Advertising success beyond Traditional Measures: New Insights from Neurophysiological Methods and Market Response Modeling,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"In the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of neurophysiological methods to better understand marketing phenomena among academics and practitioners. However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads? aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures. Notably, activity in the ventral striatum is the strongest predictor of real-world, market-level response to advertising. The authors discuss the findings and their significant implications for theory, research, and practice.",1
When Intelligence is (Dys)Functional for Achieving Sales Performance,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Using two samples of salespeople, the authors investigate how a combination of general mental ability (GMA) and specific skills and capabilities (social competence and thinking styles) enables salespeople to reach their sales goals. The study finds evidence for an interaction between GMA and social competence. When combined with high social competence, high GMA leads to the highest sales performance; when combined with low social competence, high GMA leads to the lowest sales performance. In addition, the authors find interaction effects between GMA and a judicial thinking style. Salespeople with a high GMA have the most potential for attaining high levels of sales performance when combined with specific skills; when salespeople with a high GMA lack these skills, they may become the firm's worst performers.",0
Understanding the Effect of Customer Relationship Management Efforts on Customer Retention and Customer Share Development,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Scholars have questioned the effectiveness of several customer relationship management strategies. The author investigates the differential effects of customer relationship perceptions and relationship marketing instruments on customer retention and customer share development over time. Customer relationship perceptions are considered evaluations of relationship strength and a supplier's offerings, and customer share development is the change in customer share between two periods. The results show that affective commitment and loyalty programs that provide economic incentives positively affect both customer retention and customer share development, whereas direct mailings influence customer share development. However, the effect of these variables is rather small. The results also indicate that firms can use the same strategies to affect both customer retention and customer share development.",0
Understanding the Marketing Department's Influence within the Firm,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Increasing debate centers on the decreasing influence of the marketing department within firms. This study investigates such influence and assesses its determinants and consequences. The results show that the accountability and innovativeness of the marketing department represent the two major drivers of its influence. However, the results do not indicate that the customer-connecting role of the marketing department increases its influence, though this role is important for shaping the firm's market orientation. A marketing department's influence is related positively to market orientation, which in turn is related positively to firm performance. This study also suggests a dual relationship between the marketing department's influence and market orientation. A key implication of this study is that marketers should become more accountable and innovative to gain more influence.",0
A Cross-National Investigation into the Marketing Department's Influence Within the Firm: Toward Initial Empirical Generalizations,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This study of the influence of the marketing department (MD), as well as its relationship with firm performance, includes seven industrialized countries and aims to generalize the conceptual model presented by Verhoef and Leeflang (2009). This investigation considers the antecedents of perceived MD influence, top management respect for the MD, and MD decision influence, as well as the relationships of these three influence variables with market orientation (MO) and business performance (BP). Meta-analytic procedures reveal initial empirical generalizations: Accountability, MD innovativeness, and the customer connection capabilities of the MD relate consistently to all three studied MD influence measures. The generalization also shows that MD influence contributes to BP indirectly through its positive relationship with MO and directly through its positive direct relationship with BP.",0
Determinants of International Retail Involvement: The Case of Large U.S. Retail Chains,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"Although retail operations traditionally have been considered poor candidates for international expansion, firms in mature retail markets are increasingly turning to international markets as a means for strategic growth. In this study, the authors examine how internal determinants affect the international ventures of large U.S. retail chains, comparing internal characteristics of international and domestic firms. The authors use the behavioral internationalization paradigm to develop a model of international retail involvement, which serves as a conceptual framework for the study. Through a logistic regression model, the results support the relevance of six of eight explanatory determinants of international retail involvement. The findings highlight the powerful influence of the strategic management characteristics, competitive advantages related to retail concept and logistics, and a retailer's size. In contrast, neither previous experience in direct foreign sourcing nor competitive advantages related to retail merchandise were significant in this model.",0
The Impact of Marketing-Induced versus Word-of-Mouth Customer Acquisition on Customer Equity Growth,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Companies can acquire customers through costly but fast-acting marketing investments or through slower but cheaper word-of-mouth processes. Their long-term success depends critically on the contribution of each acquired customer to overall customer equity. The authors propose and test an empirical model that captures these long-term effects. An application to a Web hosting company reveals that marketing-induced customers add more short-term value, but word-of-mouth customers add nearly twice as much long-term value to the firm. The authors illustrate their findings with some dynamic simulations of the long-term impact of different resource allocations for acquisition marketing.",1
"Retailer, Manufacturers, and Individual Consumers: Modeling the Supply Side in the Ketchup Marketplace",Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors construct a model of the local ketchup market in a Texas city that accounts for household, manufacturer, and retailer decisions. That is, the model develops both demand and supply sides of the market. The authors model the demand side through a latent utility framework that allows for a no-purchase option. Accounting for both sides of the market enables the authors to check for any endogeneity problems on the demand side. They model the supply side through the profit-maximizing decisions of the manufacturers and a multiproduct retailer. Accounting for both the retailer and the manufacturer decisions enables the authors to evaluate the degree of manufacturer competition, retailer?manufacturer interactions, and retailer product-category pricing. Given the model assumptions and the market being studied, the authors find that not accounting for demand endogeneity can create bias in the estimation, the retailer seems to price below the static profit-maximizing prices for two of the three brands, and the inferred marginal wholesale prices are below the equilibrium uniform wholesale prices for two brands. The authors discuss the results with regard to channel bargaining, quantity discounts, and retailer category pricing.",1
How Potential Conflict Drives Channel Structure: Concurrent (Direct and Indirect) Channels,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"The authors study business-to-business manufacturers' simultaneous usage of vertically integrated (direct) and third-party (indirect) channels of distribution to serve one geographical market (possibly comprising several market segments) with the same product line. Most theoretical approaches to vertical integration of the distribution function pose the classic question of whether to forward integrate or use independent entities. Having concurrent channels means doing both. This phenomenon is poorly understood, even though it has been growing rapidly. The authors argue that under certain circumstances, it is impossible for manufacturers to prevent channel types from competing with each other, either because both channel types contact the same customer or because the customer sets them in competition against each other. The authors argue that when these situations are frequent or more consequential for the parties involved, firms reduce their usage of concurrent channels to prevent severe channel conflict. The authors posit five such circumstances. Using original data from prominent manufacturers operating in competitive markets worldwide, they model usage of both types of channels to cover one geography with the same products. They find substantial support for their model. Furthermore, in a subset of firms that use both channel types in the same market, they model the degree to which direct and indirect channels compete destructively against each other when contacting the same customers. The authors find that suppliers reduce such behavior by incurring costs to differentiate each channel's offerings, setting out ?rules of engagement,? and compensating both channel types when either one makes a sale.",1
Is Cash King for Sales Compensation Plans? Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Intervention,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The pervasive use of merchandise (i.e., noncash) incentives in sales compensation plans is an empirical and theoretical puzzle given the supposed superiority of cash incentives in the standard theory (i.e., principal?agent models) as well as the scant, and contradictory empirical evidence. The authors conducted a large-scale field intervention that switched 580 salespeople at a large frozen food manufacturer away from their cash plus ?merchandise points? bonus to a commensurate all-cash bonus. After controlling for salesperson, seasonality, year, and target effects, the authors estimate that sales, on average, dropped by 4.36%. Furthermore, they estimated individual-level sales changes and effort changes to validate the incentive?effort?sales causal chain. The results show that the top salespeople experienced the largest drops in sales. A post-intervention survey of social and individual difference variables reveals that salespeople from households with more discretionary financial resources and those who think more abstractly about the uses of cash income exhibited smaller reductions in effort and sales. Although the absence of a control group prevents the authors from making strong causal inferences, this set of results nevertheless provides descriptive and suggestive evidence for separate mental accounts as the most promising explanation for the greater utility provided by merchandise incentives.",1
Decision Making and Coping of Functionally Illiterate Consumers and Some Implications for Marketing Management,Journal of Marketing,2005,"A study of the decision making and coping of functionally illiterate consumers reveals cognitive predilections, decision heuristics and trade-offs, and coping behaviors that distinguish them from literate consumers. English-as-a-second-language and poor, literate consumers are used as comparison groups. The strong predilection for concrete reasoning and overreliance on pictographic information of functionally illiterate consumers suggest that companies should reconsider how they highlight the added benefits of new products or the differentiating aspects of existing product offerings across channels such as advertising, in-store displays, and positioning. Concrete reasoning also has strong implications for the execution and presentation of price promotions through coupons and in-store discounts, because many consumers are unable to process the information and thus avoid discounted products. Finally, the elaborate coping mechanisms identified and the loyalty that functionally illiterate consumers display toward companies that are sensitive to their literacy and numeracy deficiencies reveal a potential for loyalty programs aimed at this population that do not involve price discounts.",0
"Exchanges in Marketing Systems: The Case of Subsistence Consumer?Merchants in Chennai, India",Journal of Marketing,2010,"A qualitative study of subsistence consumer?merchants (SCMs) in Chennai, India, reveals that they sustain relationships in three interdependent relationship domains: vendor, customer, and family. Relying on long interview data, the authors interpret the subsystems as closed-loop and self-sustaining relationships. Subsystems are managed by SCMs through buying and selling activities alongside the receiving and granting of credit, and these activities engender three facets of commitment: continuance, affective, and normative. Different facets of commitment underlie the relationships in the three subsystems. Through different role-based activities, SCMs enhance or diminish commitment levels to keep all three types of relationships viable while moving their scarce time, energy, and financial resources into the domain with the greatest need. Activities and the management of commitment are performed within 24-hour business cycles, with negligible resources, and in highly unstable environments, providing valuable theoretical insights and managerial implications that guide recommendations for firms wanting to serve subsistence markets successfully.",0
Online Infomediaries and Price Discrimination: Evidence from the Automotive Retailing Sector,Journal of Marketing,2007,"This article focuses on a novel mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination based on consumers' use of online infomediaries. Using the automotive retailing context as the setting for the study, the authors address the following question: Can online infomediaries serve as a viable mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination? They draw on a unique and extensive data set of consumers who report on the information they found when using online buying services (OBS) as part of their new vehicle purchase process. The analysis of the data set shows that consumers who obtain price information pay lower prices (for the same product), whereas consumers who obtain product information pay higher prices. Although this points to the existence of distinct consumer segments, this knowledge is of limited value without a viable mechanism that enables firms to identify and target these customer segments specifically. On the basis of consumer usage patterns of OBS, the authors uncover distinct OBS clusters and empirically demonstrate that the use of these different clusters is associated with predicted differences in consumer outcomes. They also show that the differential use of OBS clusters is systematically related to underlying consumer characteristics. They discuss the relevance of the findings for automobile dealers and manufacturers and for other industries in which online infomediaries have established a significant presence.",0
Empirical Entry Games with Complementarities: An Application to the Shopping Center Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The author proposes a strategic model of entry that allows for positive and negative spillovers among firms. The model is applied to a novel data set containing information about the store configurations of all U.S. regional shopping centers and is used to quantify the magnitude of interstore spillovers. The author addresses the estimation difficulties that arise due to the presence of multiple equilibria by formulating the entry game as a mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Although this study constitutes the first attempt to use this direct optimization approach to address a specific empirical problem, the method can be used in a wide range of structural estimation problems. The empirical results support the agglomeration and clustering theories that predict that firms may have incentives to colocate despite potential business stealing effects. The author shows that the firms' negative and positive strategic effects help predict both how many firms can operate profitably in a given market and the firm-type configurations. The relative magnitude of such effects varies substantially across store types.",1
Customer Equity Drivers and Future Sales,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Research on linking operational marketing inputs to customer attitudes and customer behavior has been gaining significance concomitant with the growing recognition that customers are market-based assets. In response to this, researchers and practitioners have proposed several conceptual models. Despite recent advances in research, the results are still inconclusive as to the relationship between customer attitude and future sales. A reason for this could be due to the paucity of studies combining survey-based data with behavioral data to understand better the drivers of customer behavior. With that in mind, the authors investigate the effects of customer perceptions of key marketing actions on customer attitudes and actual customer behavior as reflected by future sales. The authors propose that customer perceptions of value, brand, and relationship??customer equity drivers??affect loyalty intentions and future sales. The results of the study, which is based on a sample of 5694 customers of a large European do-it-yourself retailer, suggest that customer equity drivers can significantly predict future sales, even after the authors control for the current sales level.",0
Drivers of Brand Extension Success,Journal of Marketing,2006,"The research presented in this article addresses the issue of the significance and relative importance of the determinants of extension success by simultaneously investigating ten success factors. The empirical analysis considers the direct relationships between success factors and extension success, the structural relationships among investigated factors, and moderating effects. The authors find that fit between the parent brand and an extension product is the most important driver of brand extension success, followed by marketing support, parent-brand conviction, retailer acceptance, and parent-brand experience. The authors also find several important structural relationships among the investigated success factors (e.g., marketing support ? fit ? retailer acceptance ? extension success). Finally, the interaction terms of fit with the quality of the parent brand and with parent-brand conviction are statistically significant, albeit of relatively low importance.",0
Why the Dynamics of Competition Matter for Category Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Category management (CM) has become a widespread trade practice in recent years. A category manager's decision problem is complex and multifaceted owing to demand dependencies across products and across time. Extant research on CM has typically focused on one or the other of these dependencies, but seldom both. The authors address this research gap by presenting a competition framework that reconciles cross-sectional breadth (large numbers of stockkeeping units in any given period) with longitudinal depth (demand effects across time). The endeavor is to offer retailers a general, realistic, and practical CM approach by comprehensively accounting for competitive effects. The authors demonstrate their approach using real-world data in the beer category for a midsize grocery chain in the northeastern United States. After determining the optimal weekly prices for the entire assortment over 23 weeks, the authors report a profit yield that is 3.30% more than in the benchmark logit model and substantially more than in the retailer's current everyday low price policy.",0
Tolerating and Managing Failure: An Organizational Perspective on Customer Reacquisition Management,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Although reacquiring customers can lead to beneficial outcomes, reacquisition processes are often unpleasant for employees, who may be required to admit and address failures. Because many organizational environments reward success and punish failure, companies need to understand how to create an organizational environment that stimulates customer reacquisitions. This study investigates the impact of failure-tolerant cultures and formal reacquisition policies on successful customer reacquisition management. Drawing on organizational design theory and psychological ownership theory, the authors find that failure-tolerant cultures have an inverted U-shaped effect on reacquisition performance because moderate failure tolerance increases reacquisition attempts while not inducing more failures or increasing their severity. Formal reacquisition policies, in contrast, have a positive linear relationship. Notably, formal reacquisition policies do not conflict with failure-tolerant cultures but enhance the beneficial effects of failure tolerance on reacquisition performance; formal reacquisition policies provide guidance for reacquisition attempts that failure-tolerant cultures inspire. Finally, results show that customer reacquisition performance is positively related to overall firm financial performance, a finding that emphasizes the managerial and organizational-level importance of reacquisition management.",0
A Configuration Theory Assessment of Marketing Organization Fit with Business Strategy and Its Relationship with Marketing Performance,Journal of Marketing,2003,"Theory posits that organizing marketing activities in ways that fit the implementation requirements of a business's strategy enhances performance. However, conceptual and methodological problems make it difficult to empirically assess this proposition in the holistic way that it is theoretically framed. Drawing on configuration theory approaches in management, the authors address these problems by assessing marketing organization fit with business strategy as the degree to which a business's marketing organization differs from that of an empirically derived ideal profile that achieves superior performance by arranging marketing activities in a way that enables the implementation of a given strategy type. The authors suggest that marketing organization fit with strategic type is associated with marketing effectiveness in prospector, defender, and analyzer strategic types and with marketing efficiency in prospector and defender strategic types. The study demonstrates the utility of profile deviation approaches for strategic marketing theory development and testing.",0
Benchmarking Marketing Capabilities for Sustainable Competitive Advantage,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Market-based organizational learning has been identified as an important source of sustainable competitive advantage. One particular learning mechanism, benchmarking, is a widely used management tool that has been recognized as appropriate for identifying and enhancing valuable marketing capabilities. However, despite widespread admonitions to managers, the benchmarking of marketing capabilities as a route to sustainable competitive advantage has received scant empirical attention. The authors empirically examine the potential business performance benefits available from benchmarking the marketing capabilities of top-performing firms. The results suggest that benchmarking has the potential to become a key learning mechanism for identifying, building, and enhancing marketing capabilities to deliver sustainable competitive advantage.",0
How Complementarity and Substitution Alter the Customer Satisfaction?Repurchase Link,Journal of Marketing,2010,"Customer satisfaction is universally acknowledged as a key driver of customer repurchase behavior, but recent evidence suggests that satisfaction has no effect on repurchase under certain circumstances. In this study, the authors develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships among satisfaction, moderating variables, and repurchase. They propose that the satisfaction?repurchase link is subject to complementary and substitute effects and present satiation and inertia as key theoretical mechanisms that explain and predict those effects. In weak-satiation purchase categories, complementary effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in customer satisfaction and complementary initiatives simultaneously. In strong-satiation purchase categories, substitute effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in either customer satisfaction or substitute initiatives. An empirical test combining survey and longitudinal purchase data from two categories?fashion apparel and automobile service?provides a remarkable degree of support for the propositions. The findings offer new theoretical insights and substantive guidance for managers to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that complement or substitute for customer satisfaction.",0
Aligning Innovation with Market Characteristics in the Nonprofit Professional Theater Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this study, the authors integrate theories of innovation diffusion, relational exchange behavior, and organizational learning to explain the roles of innovation, product exploration experience, promotion, and market sophistication in determining firm performance. They test the research questions using objective measures of financial performance from a sample of 124 firms in the nonprofit professional theater industry. The results suggest that the independent variables interact in systematic ways to influence firm performance across two different customer segments: relational and transactional. The findings lend empirical support to two theoretical perspectives that have received little prior empirical examination: (1) Innovation performance is determined by characteristics of the overall marketplace and target market segments, and (2) product exploration experience enhances organizational learning and performance.",1
Strategic Orientation and Firm Performance in an Artistic Environment,Journal of Marketing,2000,"Conventional marketing wisdom holds that a customer orientation provides a firm with a better understanding of its customers, which subsequently leads to enhanced customer satisfaction and firm performance. However, there are cautions that being too customer focused can lead to inertia, and anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be better to ?ignore your customer? when developing new products. Building on the market orientation research stream, the authors examine the impact of three alternative strategic orientations?customer orientation, competitor orientation, and product orientation?on a variety of subjective and objective measures of performance in the nonprofit professional theater industry, which is marked by high rates of artistic innovation and largely unpredictable customer preferences. The results indicate that the association between strategic orientation and performance varies depending on the type of performance measure used. However, the most unambiguous result is that a customer orientation exhibits a negative association with subscriber ticket sales, total income, and net surplus/deficit.",0
Competitive Density and the Customer Acquisition?Retention Trade-Off,Journal of Marketing,2008,"The authors build on conceptual and analytic evidence to argue that firms can increase performance by shifting emphasis away from customer retention strategies toward customer acquisition strategies as competitive density (i.e., the number of competitors) increases and the marketplace becomes more dynamic. Empirical research using four data sources for a single artistic industry produces strong support for the moderation hypotheses. When competitive density is low, a customer retention strategy emphasizing close relationships with customers and adaptive learning enhances performance. When competitive density is high, a customer acquisition strategy emphasizing innovation and competitor learning enhances performance. Four key takeaways emerge. As competitive density increases, (1) the financial impact of choosing the right mix of resources and capabilities increases; (2) close customer relationships become liabilities, providing no revenue benefits and exerting a negative effect on net income; (3) close relationships with suppliers increase revenues but also expenses, so that net income decreases; and (4) adaptive learning lowers revenue and, even more so, expenses, so that net income increases. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and identify combinations of resources and capabilities that achieve different performance objectives.",0
Measuring the Hedonic and Utilitarian Dimensions of Consumer Attitude,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"This article reports the development and validation of a parsimonious, generalizable scale that measures the hedonic and utilitarian dimensions of consumer attitudes toward product categories and different brands within categories. The hedonic/utilitarian (HED/UT) scale includes ten semantic differential response items, five of which refer to the hedonic dimension and five of which refer to the utilitarian dimension of consumer attitudes. The authors conducted six studies to establish the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the two HED/UT subscales. In reaching the final scale, the authors also develop and implement a unique process of paring down a psychometrically sound but otherwise too large set of items. Nomological validity is established by replacing a typical, one-dimensional attitude toward the brand measure with the hedonic and utilitarian dimensions in a central route processing model. Results suggest that the hedonic and utilitarian constructs are two distinct dimensions of brand attitude and are reliably and validly measured by the HED/UT scale.",1
Close Encounter with the Hard Discounter: A Multiple-Store Shopping Perspective on the Impact of Local Hard-Discounter Entry,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"?Hard discounters? (HDs) have become a considerable force in grocery retailing. With rock-bottom prices and minimal assortments, they differ greatly from ?large discounters? such as Wal-Mart, constituting complements to, rather than substitutes for, more traditional supermarkets. Therefore, the authors propose that HD impact of entry on local incumbents is different as well. Using a store choice and spending model that explicitly accounts for interstore synergies and multiple-store shopping behavior, the authors study consumer responses to 194 HD openings. Although they find that HDs, like large discounters, especially appeal to private label?prone shoppers and lead to sizable incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains alongside the incumbent are lost. Second, the authors find that chains located in close proximity to new HDs do not suffer more from their entry. Third, losses are lower for upscale chains and incumbents that strongly complement the HD. The authors conclude by discussing implications for proper response to HD entry.",1
A Bite to Whet the Reward Appetite: The Influence of Sampling on Reward-Seeking Behaviors,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"In this research, the authors show that sampling a consumption cue (e.g., a flavored beverage) that is high in incentive value (i.e., tastes good) not only enhances subsequent consumption of other similar consumption cues (e.g., Pepsi) but also prompts people to seek anything rewarding (e.g., chocolate, a massage). The authors propose that this phenomenon, which they term ?reverse alliesthesia,? occurs as a result of the activation of a general motivational state by cues that are high in incentive value. They test this proposition by showing that the effect is (1) attenuated if the activated motivational state is satiated before the subsequent consumption task and (2) stronger for people who are high rather than low on the behavioral activation system scale. Finally, the authors extend their core findings to nongustatory cues by showing that (un)pleasant odors can also lead to an increase (decrease) in subsequent reward-seeking behaviors.",1
Does Customer Demotion Jeopardize Loyalty?,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Hierarchical loyalty programs award elevated customer status (e.g., ?elite membership?) to consumers who meet a predefined spending level. However, if a customer subsequently falls short of the required spending level, firms commonly revoke that status. The authors investigate the impact of such customer demotion on loyalty intentions toward the firm. Building on prospect theory and emotions theory, the authors hypothesize that changes in customer status have an asymmetric negative effect, such that the negative impact of customer demotion is stronger than the positive impact of status increases. An experimental scenario study provides evidence that loyalty intentions are indeed lower for demoted customers than for those who have never been awarded a preferred status, meaning that hierarchical loyalty programs can drive otherwise loyal customers away from a firm. A field study using proprietary sales data from a different industry context demonstrates the robustness of the negative impact of customer demotion. The authors test the extent to which design variables of hierarchical loyalty programs may attenuate the negative consequences of status demotions with a second experimental scenario study and present an analytical model that links status demotion to customer equity to aid managerial decision making.",0
Corporate Hypocrisy: Overcoming the Threat of Inconsistent Corporate Social Responsibility Perceptions,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Reports of firms' behaviors with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) are often contrary to their stated standards of social responsibility. This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm. Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy. Study 3 reveals that an inoculation communication strategy reduces perceived hypocrisy and minimizes its negative consequences, regardless of whether the CSR strategy is proactive or reactive.",0
Involving Sales Managers in Sales Force Compensation Design,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Sales force incentive design often involves significant participation by sales managers in designing the compensation plans of salespeople who report to them. Although sales managers hold valuable territory-level information, they may benefit from misrepresenting that information given their own incentives. The author uses a game theoretic model to show (1) how a firm can efficiently leverage a manager?s true knowledge and (2) the conditions under which involving the manager is optimal. Under the proposed approach, the firm delegates sales incentive decisions to the manager within restrictive constraints. She can then request relaxed constraints by fulfilling certain requirements. The author shows how these constraints and requirements can be set to ensure the firm?s best possible outcome given the manager?s information. Thus, this ?request mechanism? offers an efficient, reliable alternative to approaches often used in practice to incorporate managerial input, such as internal negotiations and behind-the-scenes lobbying. The author then identifies the conditions under which this mechanism outperforms the well-established theoretical approach of offering the salesperson a menu of contracts to reveal territory-level information.",1
Cross-National Advertising and Behavioral Intentions: A Multilevel Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Previous research has provided limited insight into (1) the cross-national effectiveness of marketing communication aimed at engaging consumers and (2) the moderating role of national characteristics. This study assesses the effectiveness of a cross-national advertising campaign in terms of changing behavioral intentions. The authors examine the moderating effects of country-level indicators representing three institutional pillars (regulative, normative/moral, and cultural-cognitive) on the mediated associations between three advertising persuasion measures (message comprehension, attitude toward the campaign, and message elaboration) and behavioral intentions. The authors examine a multilevel analysis using survey data related to a 25-country advertising campaign to test hypothesized within-country and between-country effects. The results show that message comprehension affects message elaboration less strongly in countries with stronger regulative, normative/moral, and cultural-cognitive pillars. Attitude toward the campaign affects message elaboration less strongly in countries with stronger normative/moral and cultural-cognitive pillars. Message elaboration affects behavioral intention less strongly in countries with a stronger regulative pillar but more strongly in countries with a stronger normative/moral pillar. The authors discuss implications for international marketing theory and practice.",0
Mixing It Up: Unsystematic Product Arrangements Promote the Choice of Unfamiliar Products,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"This research examines how the unsystematic (vs. systematic) spatial arrangement of a set of alternatives affects consumers? product choices. The key hypothesis is that an unsystematic product arrangement?in which an assortment consisting of several alternatives is arranged in an apparently arbitrary manner?causes greater perceptual disfluency, which in turn triggers more extensive exploratory product search, ultimately promoting the choice of unfamiliar products. This sequence of effects is particularly pronounced when consumers do not have a strong prior preference for specific alternatives in the assortment. Evidence from five studies, including a large-scale field experiment, provides support for this theorizing across various display formats and product domains. The findings advance our understanding of how the spatial arrangement of a product assortment influences consumer choice, and they shed light on the psychological mechanism that governs this effect.",1
Executive Insights: Marketing Strategy in Emerging Markets: The Case of China,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"The Chinese market's attractiveness to international marketers has recently received a significant boost as a result of the country's admission into the World Trade Organization. Membership in the World Trade Organization requires trade barriers to be reduced and new sectors of the economy to be opened to foreign firms according to a predesignated timetable, which in turn will make this most populous country a promising market for marketers. Despite these positive developments, acquiring reliable information and, in particular, the understanding of the market presents big challenges to the development of a viable Chinese marketing strategy. In this article, the authors explore barriers to information acquisition in China and focus on the need to understand crucial dimensions of the operating environment with respect to internal protectionism, relationship development, the diversity of the market, and competitive contexts.",0
The Effect of Regulatory Depletion on Attitude Certainty,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"This research explores how regulatory depletion affects consumers' responses to advertising. Initial forays into this area suggest that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is irrelevant when advertisement arguments are strong or consumers are highly motivated to process. In contrast to these conclusions, the authors contend that depletion has important but previously hidden effects in such contexts. That is, although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty. The authors discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for marketing.",1
Observer Effects of Punishment in a Distribution Network,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"In a distribution network, a punishment event not only affects the disciplined distributor but also changes the attitudes and behaviors of others in the network (i.e., observers). By moving beyond a dyadic view of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational embeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects. The authors discuss both theoretical and managerial implications of using punishment to achieve collaboration from a wide network of channel members.",1
Reasons for Market Evolution and Budgeting Implications,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Identifying market evolution is a necessary step in persistence analysis of marketing input?output relationships. Using the advertising?sales relationship to represent general marketing input?output dynamics, the authors theoretically distinguish two types of market evolution: (1) intrinsic evolution, in which sales evolve independent of advertising and temporary advertising can generate persistent effects, and (2) induced evolution, in which sales evolution is supported by sustained advertising budgets in an intrinsic-stationary market and there are no real persistent effects of temporary advertising. The proposed intrinsic market evolution test can identify intrinsic-evolving and intrinsic-stationary markets. The authors analyze five major budgeting implications and provide methods to quantify temporary and sustained budgeting. In general, in an intrinsic-evolving market, budgeting can be short-term focused, whereas in an intrinsic-stationary market, the focus should be on sustained budgeting. Percentage budgeting at a sufficient level can create induced evolution. Contrary to conventional wisdom, temporary, intensive advertising campaigns are often not necessary. Empirical illustrations demonstrate the two types of evolutions and the relationships between budgeting methods and sales performance.",0
Successfully Communicating a Cocreated Innovation,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Despite the growing popularity of cocreation approaches to innovation, the bottom-line results of these efforts continue to frustrate many firms. Marketing communications are one important tool in stimulating consumer adoption, yet marketers to date have not taken advantage of a unique phenomenon associated with many cocreated innovations: the presence of a genesis story in the words of the creator, which can be combined in different ways with traditional marketing messaging. Using mixed methods, the authors demonstrate a crossover effect in which a ?mismatch? of the fundamental motivations behind authentic creation narratives and traditional persuasive messages enhances adoption of the cocreated innovation. This effect is mediated by potential adopters? self-referencing of their own stories about similar experiences or consumption episodes. Furthermore, the effect of a motivation mismatch strategy is attenuated for expert consumers. Finally, this motivation mismatch strategy triggers ?takeoff? of cocreated innovations. This research offers substantial implications for research on cocreated innovation, narrative persuasion, and firm-generated and user-generated communication. It provides managers specific guidance on enhancing the success of cocreation programs through an integrated communications strategy.",0
The Role of Regulatory Focus in Preference Construction,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"The authors examine how consumers' regulatory focus affects their information search behavior and decision-making process. The results show that uninvolved research participants rely on their regulatory focus as a filter to process information selectively. Participants paid more attention to and based their product evaluation on product information that is relevant to their regulatory concerns, but only when they were not motivated to process information. This regulatory fit effect on evaluation seems to be driven by the perceptual salience of fit versus nonfit information and is more consistent with heuristic than with systematic processing of information.",1
Trade-Offs and Depletion in Choice,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Four experiments examine why choices deplete executive resources. The authors show that the resolution of trade-offs is a driver of depletion effects arising from choice, and the larger the trade-offs, the greater is the depletion effect. The authors also find that choice difficulty not related to trade-offs does not influence the depleting effect of the choices. Finally, the authors find that though people can intuit some depletion effects, they do not intuit that choices or trade-offs within choices might be depleting and therefore fail to predict that larger trade-offs are more depleting.",1
Can Offline Stores Drive Online Sales?,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"The authors use evidence from store openings by a bricks-and-clicks retailer to examine the drivers of substitution and complementarity between online and offline retail channels. The evidence supports the coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in demand. In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store, that drives complementarity.",1
Can A Retail Web Site be Social?,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Avatars are lifelike characters created by technology. Research suggests that avatars can increase the persuasiveness of online sales channels. The authors investigate how the social cues inherent in avatars influence consumers' affect and shopping value. In Study 1, social cues induce perceptions of Web site socialness, leading to increased pleasure and arousal, both of which positively influence flow, hedonic and utilitarian value, and patronage intentions. Study 2 finds that social cue?induced arousal leads to increased pleasure only for consumers who are involved with the product category. Moreover, the influence of arousal on hedonic value is stronger for women, flow does not lead to pleasure for older consumers, and utilitarian value is less important for this group than for their younger counterparts. The findings suggest that there is a competitive advantage for online retailers that use social cues that provide consumers with enhanced perceptions of human connection and the formation of emotional bonds.",0
The Origins of Trust Asymmetry in International Relationships: An Institutional View,Journal of International Marketing,2020,"Trust is key to relationship marketing. Although trust is bilateral, studies on the dispersion of trust among exchange parties remain limited, leaving the antecedents and outcomes of trust asymmetry largely underexplored. To fill the gaps, this study empirically examines the effects of different types of trust asymmetry on exchange performance and then investigates the institutional origins of trust asymmetry in international interfirm exchanges. Drawing on a survey of 134 international buyer?supplier relationships in China, the study finds that both calculative trust asymmetry and relational trust asymmetry have negative influences on exchange performance. The study also finds that formal institutional distance constrains calculative trust asymmetry and informal institutional distance increases relational trust asymmetry. Moreover, prior interactions and expectations of continuity significantly moderate the effects of formal and informal institutional distance. This study advances trust studies in cross-border settings.",0
Serial Position Effects on Native Advertising Effectiveness: Differential Results Across Publisher and Advertiser Metrics,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The advertising industry has recently witnessed proliferation in native ads, which are inserted into a web stream (e.g., a list of news articles or social media posts) and look like the surrounding nonsponsored contents. This study is among the first to examine native ads and unveil how their effectiveness changes across serial positions by analyzing a large-scale data set with 120 ads. For each ad, the authors use separate ?natural experiment? studies to compare the ad?s performance as its serial position varies. Subsequently, they conduct a meta-analysis to generalize the results across all studies. The results reveal vastly asymmetric effects of native ad serial position on publishers? metrics (click-based) versus advertisers? metrics (conversion-based). As serial position lowers (i.e., from rank 1 to a lower rank), there are only modest changes in publishers? metrics, but drastic reductions in advertisers?. This pattern is unique to native ads and has not been indicated by prior research on ad serial position. Moreover, the authors show the moderating effects of audience gender and age. The findings provide new and timely implications for researchers and marketers.",0
Survival in Markets with Network Effects: Product Compatibility and Order-of-Entry Effects,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This article proposes a new conceptual framework in which the impact of network effects (NE) on a pioneer's survival advantage compared with its early followers can be positive or negative depending on two important but previously ignored market characteristics: (1) cross-generation product compatibility and (2) within-generation product compatibility. The authors empirically test the theoretical predictions using data from 45 NE markets. They show that these two types of compatibility affect the pioneer's survival advantage in opposite directions and that such directions are reversed when NE changes from extremely strong to extremely weak. Specifically, in markets with strong NE, cross-generation incompatibility harms but within-generation incompatibility favors the pioneer's survival advantage. Consequently, pioneers are likely to enjoy a survival advantage when their product is cross-generation compatible but within-generation incompatible. However, in markets with weak NE, pioneer survival advantage is likely to occur under opposite conditions (i.e., cross-generation incompatible but within-generation compatible). The policy analysis further suggests that the best survival condition for pioneers often turns out to be the worst for followers in these markets.",0
Will Consumers be Willing to Pay more when your Competitors Adopt your Technology? The Impacts of the Supporting-Firm Base in Markets with Network Effects,Journal of Marketing,2011,"Network effects and standards competition introduce significant market uncertainty, creating a substantial challenge to the success of innovating firms. Although the literature has highlighted the importance of establishing a large installed-user base (the number of users adopting the same product) in such markets, the authors draw attention to a different, but potentially important, market force: the supporting-firm base, which they define as the number of firms supporting the same technological standard. They test their proposed hypotheses using data from two markets: the floppy disk drive and personal digital assistant markets. Their results show that (1) consumer product valuation is positively affected not only by the installed-user base but also by the supporting-firm base, (2) the two positive effects interact with each other and the nature of the interaction changes over the evolution of the market (i.e., they strengthen each other's impact in the early stage but weaken each other's impact in the late stage of the product life cycle), and (3) not all supporting firms are equally valuable to the innovator?specifically, consumers are affected more by firms exclusively supporting a single standard than by firms supporting multiple standards and by incumbents than by new entrants.",0
Mobility of Top Marketing and Sales Executives in Business-to-Business Markets: A Social Network Perspective,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"In business-to-business markets, top marketing and sales executives (TMSEs) have considerable influence on their organizations? customer strategies. When TMSEs switch firms, a pattern of informal organizational connections results; this pattern reflects the flow of information and knowledge among firms and creates managerial social capital in the process. To model this information flow, the current study considers information reach and richness, conceptualized according to the network position (i.e., centrality and brokerage) of the firm in the TMSE mobility network, which can be constructed by tracing executive movements through the work experience records of TMSEs in an industry. TMSE tenure (i.e., time with the firm) and firm market orientation constitute critical moderators, which capture motivation and ability at the individual and firm level, respectively. Data from the semiconductor industry and a model that corrects for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity suggest that managerial social capital enhances firm performance; however, TMSE tenure and firm market orientation are essential for absorbing the benefits of managerial social capital.",1
Employees? Decision Making in the Face of Customers? Fuzzy Return Requests,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Frontline service employees frequently encounter customers? fuzzy requests, defined as requests that are slightly or somewhat outside company policy but not completely unacceptable or detrimental to the company. Employees? compliance decisions can profoundly affect customers, organizations, and employees themselves. However, the complex decision process in which service employees engage is largely unexplored. The authors draw from script and motivated reasoning theories, as well as qualitative interviews, to model employees? responses to customers? fuzzy requests in a retail setting. The results, which are based on a national survey of retail employees, indicate that employees with higher customer orientation and higher conflict avoidance tend to handle fuzzy return requests in a friendlier, more effortful manner, especially when customers demonstrate an affiliative style. In contrast, when customers display a dominant style, employees engage in motivated reasoning and perceive the request to be less legitimate, reducing their likelihood of complying. In addition, the employees? perceived flexibility influences their compliance decisions, but punishment expectations do not. The authors conclude with some managerial implications, including better identification of these requests and more training of employees to handle them appropriately.",0
Modeling Gift Choice: The Effect of Uncertainty on Price Sensitivity,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Gift giving generates high revenues for retailers. It is also marked with significant welfare, or deadweight, loss in that givers tend to pay more than the receivers? valuation. Previous research has attributed this discrepancy to givers? inaccurate predictions of the receivers? preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price, especially when givers are uncertain about receivers? preferences. Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with heterogeneous prices. These findings have key implications for the gift industry.",1
Reservation Price as a Range: An Incentive-Compatible Measurement Approach,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Drawing from the literature on buyers' uncertainty in preference and product knowledge, the authors suggest and empirically test the proposition that a consumer's reservation price for a product is more meaningfully and accurately represented as a range than as a single point. Given this conceptualization, they propose an approach for incentive-compatible elicitation of a consumer's reservation price range (ICERANGE) that builds on Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) point-of-purchase method. Two empirical applications of the approach provide an assessment of its practicality and its predictive performance relative to current methodologies for reservation price elicitation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the benchmark approaches in terms of predictive validity and yields valuable incremental information about uncertainty in product valuation.",1
Turning off the Lights: Consumers' Environmental Efforts Depend on Visible Efforts of Firms,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Firms can save considerable money if consumers conserve resources (e.g., if hotel patrons turn off the lights when leaving the room, if restaurant patrons use fewer paper napkins, if airline passengers clean up after themselves). In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment.",1
When and how Managers' Responses to Online Reviews Affect Subsequent Reviews,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"In this study, the authors investigate the externalities of managers' responses (MRs) to online reviews on popular travel websites. Specifically, the authors examine the effect of publicly responding to hotel guests' reviews on subsequent reviewer ratings. The authors find that manager responses to negative reviews (MR-N) can significantly influence subsequent opinion in a positive way if those responses are observable at the time of reviewing. Notably, the findings show this externality to be negative for manager responses to positive reviews (MR-P). The authors conduct a topic analysis on review texts and corresponding MRs to study the moderating role of response tailoring on the opinion externalities of MR. The authors show that tailored MR amplifies the positive (negative) impact of MR-N (MR-P) on subsequent opinion. Intuitively, tailoring an MR-N adds specificity to the hotel's complaint management strategy, bolstering the positive effects of MR-N on subsequent opinion. However, by highlighting specific positive elements of a review, managers' intent for responding is brought into question as they take advantage of reviewers' positive feedback to promote their hotel.",1
"Up, Up, and Away: Upgrading as a Response to Dissimilar Brand Users",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Researchers have found that consumers abandon and avoid products when they feel threatened by the presence of dissimilar groups who also use the product. In this article, the authors propose a different strategy for responding to dissimilar users, upgrading to a brand?s more exclusive products. Results from six studies show that upgrading is a preferred strategy for consumers with strong self?brand connections, who are unlikely to avoid or abandon the brand because their self-identity is tied to the brand. Among these consumers, the act of upgrading to a brand?s more exclusive products is driven by their feelings of self-threat when exposed to dissimilar users, which triggers a desire to attain a higher-status position among brand users that is fulfilled by upgrading. The authors also identify moderators of the upgrading effect for consumers with strong self?brand connections. These consumers? increased interest in upgrading is dampened when a brand?s exclusive products are made more readily available and when a brand has already conferred higher status to them through a customer status tier program.",1
Project Customization and the Supplier Revenue?Cost Dilemmas: The Critical Roles of Supplier?Customer Coordination,Journal of Marketing,2017,"This study examines customization as a coordination problem in transactions with business customers. Marketing research has investigated challenges associated with customized offers from the customer side; however, scant research has examined the supplier's challenges and their performance implications. The authors distinguish between project revenues and costs to reveal a fundamental dilemma that suppliers face during customization. Analyses of dyadic survey data collected from a software supplier and its business customers, as well as objective revenue and cost data, reveal a tension between project revenues and costs. The outcomes of customization depend on factors that relieve the coordination problem, such as customer demand ambiguity, customer participation, product modularity, project team technological capability, and relational embeddedness. These findings provide a basis to assess the value of customization as a tool to implement a customer-oriented business-to-business marketing strategy.",0
Behavioral Consequences of Overbooking Service Capacity,Journal of Marketing,2007,"As a consequence of implementing revenue management systems, many service firms (e.g., airlines, hotels, car rentals) systematically overbook capacity, thus striving to maximize the revenue at one particular point in time (i.e., one flight, one night, and one day). The academic literature has not addressed how customers behaviorally respond to overbooking experiences, such as downgrading, denied service, or upgrading. In this article, the authors use the econometric technique of conditional difference-in-differences analysis to study the effect of such incidences on customer usage patterns in an airline context. They find that customers who experience negative consequences of revenue management significantly reduce the amount of their transactions with the airline, whereas upgraded customers exhibit only weak positive responses. The effects of the negative events are stronger for high-value customer groups, whereas significant effects of positive events can be found only for a low-value customer group. The results suggest the need for a stronger focus on customer reactions to revenue management practices. On a more general level, the study contributes to a more interdisciplinary view of service management by demonstrating the need for a closer interaction between management functions (e.g., marketing and operations) in developing and managing concepts of companywide importance.",0
Can ?Low-Fat? Nutrition Labels Lead to Obesity?,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"In this era of increasing obesity and increasing threats of legislation and regulation of food marketing practices, regulatory agencies have pointedly asked how ?low-fat? nutrition claims may influence food consumption. The authors develop and test a framework that contends that low-fat nutrition labels increase food intake by (1) increasing perceptions of the appropriate serving size and (2) decreasing consumption guilt. Three studies show that low-fat labels lead all consumers?particularly those who are overweight?to overeat snack foods. Furthermore, salient objective serving-size information (e.g., ?Contains 2 Servings?) reduces overeating among guilt-prone, normal-weight consumers but not among overweight consumers. With consumer welfare and corporate profitability in mind, the authors suggest win-win packaging and labeling insights for public policy officials and food marketers.",1
Ask and You Shall (Not) Receive: Close Friends Prioritize Relational Signaling over Recipient Preferences in Their Gift Choices,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Gift givers balance their goal to please recipients with gifts that match recipient preferences against their own goal to signal relational closeness with gifts that demonstrate their knowledge of the recipient. Five studies in a gift registry context show that when close (vs. distant) givers receive attribution for the gifts they choose, they are more likely to diverge from the registry to choose items that signal their close relationships. The authors find that close givers? divergence from the registry is not the result of their altruistic search for a ?better? gift but is a strategic effort to express relational signals: it occurs only when givers will receive attribution for their choice. They show that close givers reconcile their goal conflict by engaging in motivated reasoning, which results in their perceptual distortion of the gift options in favor of relational-signaling gifts. Ironically, distant givers are more likely to choose gifts from the registry, resulting in the selection of items that better match recipient preferences.",1
Brand Coolness,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Marketers strive to create cool brands, but the literature does not offer a blueprint for what ?brand coolness? means or what features characterize cool brands. This research uses a mixed-methods approach to conceptualize brand coolness and identify a set of characteristics typically associated with cool brands. Focus groups, depth interviews, and an essay study indicate that cool brands are perceived to be extraordinary, aesthetically appealing, energetic, high status, rebellious, original, authentic, subcultural, iconic, and popular. In nine quantitative studies (surveys and experiments), the authors develop scale items to reliably measure the component characteristics of brand coolness; show that brand coolness influences important outcome variables, including consumers? attitudes toward, satisfaction with, intentions to talk about, and willingness to pay for the brand; and demonstrate how cool brands change over time. At first, most brands become cool to a small niche, at which point they are perceived to be more subcultural, rebellious, authentic, and original. Over time, some cool brands become adopted by the masses, at which point they are perceived to be more popular and iconic.",0
When 1 + 1 > 2: How Investors React to New Product Releases Announced Concurrently with Other Corporate News,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Firms routinely use press releases to announce the launch of their new products. An examination of these press releases shows that in approximately 7% of cases, firms issue new product announcements concurrently with other corporate announcements. However, the consequences of these actions are unknown because event studies typically eliminate concurrent announcements in an attempt to avoid their confounding effects. The authors use a comprehensive sample of press releases issued by publicly traded U.S. firms to document the consequences of firms announcing the release of a new product concurrently with another corporate announcement that conveys good news. Drawing on Merton's (1987) model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information, the authors identify three conditions that are conducive to the issuance of concurrent new product announcements. They then verify that under these conditions, the increase in shareholder value associated with concurrent announcements is higher than that associated with issuing two similar announcements separately. This research provides insights into how firms can leverage corporate communications to increase stock prices.",0
Interpreting the Stock Returns to New Product Announcements: How the past Shapes Investors? Expectations of the Future,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Investors routinely follow firms? communications and actions to form expectations about the firms? future performance. The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors? expectations of future firm performance.",1
Choice of Supplier in Embedded Markets: Relationship and Marketing Program Effects,Journal of Marketing,2001,"Recent research has documented how exchanges between buyers and sellers are frequently embedded in social relationships. An unresolved question, however, is the extent to which such relationships protect incumbent suppliers from new competitors and their marketing programs. The authors develop a conceptual framework of how relationship and marketing variables influence choice of supplier and test the framework empirically in the context of business-to-business services. The results show that interpersonal relationships between buyers and suppliers serve as a switching barrier but are considerably less important than both firm-level switching costs and marketing variables. Moreover, unlike switching costs, interpersonal relationships do not play the frequently mentioned role of a buffer against price and product competition. Finally, the authors show that buyers and suppliers hold systematically different views of the determinants of switching.",0
"Opportunism in Interfirm Relationships: Forms, Outcomes, and Solutions",Journal of Marketing,2000,"Much of the recent literature on interfirm relationships has focused on strategies for controlling opportunism. Somewhat surprisingly, little attention has been paid in this literature to the opportunism construct itself. Specifically, prior research has failed to recognize the different types of behavior that are hidden behind the general opportunism label. As a consequence, the knowledge of strategies for managing opportunism remains incomplete. The authors review the original and emergent conceptualizations of opportunism and illustrate them using actual industry cases. The authors also develop a conceptual framework of governance strategies that can be used to manage different forms of opportunism.",0
Relationship Governance in a Supply Chain Network,Journal of Marketing,2004,"The authors examine how a firm's strategy in a (downstream) customer relationship is contingent on how a related relationship outside of the focal dyad is organized. Drawing on emerging perspectives on interfirm governance and networks, the authors propose that the ability to show flexibility toward a (downstream) customer under uncertain market conditions depends on the governance mechanisms that have been deployed in an (upstream) supplier relationship. The governance mechanisms take the form of (1) supplier qualification programs and (2) incentive structures based on hostages. The authors develop a set of contingency predictions and test them empirically in the context of vertical supply chain networks in the apparel industry. The tests show good support for the hypotheses. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for marketing theory and practice.",0
Relationship Governance Dynamics: The Roles of Partner Selection Efforts and Mutual Investments,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The article studies interfirm governance in the context of supplier?reseller relationships. Using a longitudinal study, the authors examine the roles of supplier selection efforts and mutual specific investments with respect to (1) motivating a supplier to make incremental investments and (2) safeguarding these investments from supplier ex post transaction costs. The authors also examine the joint effects of selection efforts and mutual investments on supplier ex post transaction costs. From a practical standpoint, the findings suggest guidelines for channel strategy. Theoretically, they provide new insights into relationship dynamics, including evidence regarding the effects of a firm?s governance choices over time.",1
"International Market Entry Strategies: Relational, Digital, and Hybrid Approaches",Journal of International Marketing,2018,"The adoption of digital communications, facilitated by Internet technology, has been among the most significant international business developments of the past 25 years. This article investigates the effect of these new technologies and the changing global business environment to understand how relational approaches to international market entry (IME) are changing in light of macro developments. Despite substantial resources in business practice dedicated to combining relational strategies in digital settings, this analysis of extant literature reveals that fewer than 3% of peer-reviewed research articles in the international marketing domain examine digital contexts. To address this gap, the authors assess 25 years of literature to provide (1) a description of the evolution of IME research; (2) a review and synthesis of pertinent literature that adopts relational, digital, and hybrid approaches to IME; (3) a taxonomy of IME strategies; and (4) directions for further research.",0
Swayed by the Numbers: The Consequences of Displaying Product Review Attributes,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Prior research has shown the independent effects of average product ratings and number of reviews for online purchases, but the relative influence of these aggregate review attributes is still debated in the literature. In this research, the authors demonstrate the conditional influences of these two attributes as a function of the valence of average product ratings and the level of review numbers in a choice set. Specifically, they argue that the diagnosticity of the number of reviews, relative to average product ratings, increases when average product ratings are negative or neutral (vs. positive) and when the level of review numbers in a choice set is low (vs. high). As a result, when consumers choose among the best options on one of the review attributes (average product ratings or the number of reviews), their preference shifts from the higher-rated option with fewer reviews toward the lower-rated option with more reviews. The authors demonstrate this preference shift in seven studies, elucidate the underlying process by which this occurs, and conclude with a discussion of the implications for retailers and brands.",0
A Reference Price Theory of the Endowment Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The common finding that selling prices exceed buying prices (the so-called endowment effect) is typically explained by the assumptions that consumers evaluate potential transactions with respect to their current holdings and that the owners of a good regard its potential loss to be more significant than nonowners regard its potential acquisition. In contrast to this ?pain-of-losing? account, the authors propose that the endowment effect reflects a reluctance to trade on terms that appear unfavorable with respect to salient reference prices. In six experiments (and eight more summarized in appendixes), the authors show that manipulations that reduce the gap between valuations and reference prices reduce or eliminate the endowment effect. These results suggest that the endowment effect is often best construed as an aversion to bad deals rather than an aversion to losing possessions.",1
Creating Truth-Telling Incentives with the Bayesian Truth Serum,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The Bayesian truth serum (BTS) is a survey scoring method that creates truth-telling incentives for respondents answering multiple-choice questions about intrinsically private matters, such as opinions, tastes, and behavior. The authors test BTS in several studies, primarily using recognition questionnaires that present items such as brand names and scientific terms. One-third of the items were nonexistent foils. The BTS mechanism, which mathematically rewards ?surprisingly common? answers, both rewarded truth telling, by heavily penalizing foil recognition, and induced truth telling, in that participants who were paid according to their BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils than control groups, even when given competing incentives to exaggerate. Survey takers who received BTS-based payments without explanation became less likely to recognize foils as they progressed through the survey, suggesting that they learned to respond to BTS incentives despite the absence of guidance. The mechanism also outperformed the solemn oath, a competing truth-inducement mechanism. Finally, when applied to judgments about contributing to a public good, BTS eliminated the bias common in contingent valuation elicitations.",1
The Effect of Perceived Similarity on Sequential Risk Taking,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"The authors examine how perceived similarity between sequential risks affects individuals? risk-taking intentions. Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the similarity structures that exist between risks have a significant effect on risk-taking preferences in dynamic choice settings.",1
Marketing Analytics for Data-Rich Environments,Journal of Marketing,2016,"The authors provide a critical examination of marketing analytics methods by tracing their historical development, examining their applications to structured and unstructured data generated within or external to a firm, and reviewing their potential to support marketing decisions. The authors identify directions for new analytical research methods, addressing (1) analytics for optimizing marketing-mix spending in a data-rich environment, (2) analytics for personalization, and (3) analytics in the context of customers? privacy and data security. They review the implications for organizations that intend to implement big data analytics. Finally, turning to the future, the authors identify trends that will shape marketing analytics as a discipline as well as marketing analytics education.",0
Analyzing Brand Competition across Subcategories,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"The authors develop a sales model that can be used to assess cross-category price effects that are specific to individual items (stockkeeping units) from store-level sales data. Previous cross-category studies have typically assumed that the cross-category effects are the same across brands or items because the potential number of price effects to be estimated is large. The authors address this problem by decomposing the variability of cross-category price effects into two components: variability across items and across stores. They capture the variability across items by representing the item-level parameters as draws from distributions with category-level means. They account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen, and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than that of store brands on national brands. In addition, the model supports the implementation of price zones at a more granular level than the current practice.",1
"Portraying Humans as Machines to Promote Health: Unintended Risks, Mechanisms, and Solutions",Journal of Marketing,2020,"To fight obesity and educate consumers on how the human body functions, health education and marketing materials often highlight the importance of adopting a cognitive approach to food. One strategy employed to promote this approach is to portray humans as machines. Five studies (and three replication and follow-up studies) using different human-as-machine stimuli (internal body composition, face, appearance, and physical movement) revealed divergent effects of human-as-machine representations. While these stimuli promoted healthier choices among consumers who were high in eating self-efficacy, they backfired among consumers who were low in eating self-efficacy (measured in Studies 1 and 3?5; manipulated in Study 2). This reversal happened because portraying humans as machines activated consumers? expectation of adopting a cognitive, machine-like approach to food (Studies 3 and 4)?an expectation that was too difficult to meet for those with low (vs. high) eating self-efficacy. We tested a solution to accompany human-as-machine stimuli in the field (Study 5): we externally enhanced how easy and doable it was for consumers low in eating self-efficacy to adopt a cognitive approach to food, which effectively attenuated the backfire effect on their lunch choices at a cafeteria.",0
Misresponse to Reversed and Negated Items in Surveys: A Review,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"There are important advantages to including reversed items in questionnaires (e.g., control of acquiescence, disruption of nonsubstantive responding, better coverage of the domain of content of a construct), but reversed items can also lead to measurement problems (e.g., low measure reliability, complex factor structures). The authors advocate the continued use of reversed items in measurement instruments but also argue that they should be used with caution. To help researchers improve their scale construction practices, the authors provide a comprehensive review of the literature on reversed and negated items and offer recommendations about their use in questionnaires. The theoretical discussion is supplemented with data on 1330 items from measurement scales that have appeared in Journal of Marketing Research and Journal of Consumer Research.",1
"Listening to Strangers: Whose Responses are Valuable, how Valuable are They, and Why?",Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"Marketing managers and consumers who use the Web as a source of information often use input from strangers to make decisions or gain knowledge. The authors propose that in such contexts, the information provider's current and past behaviors, relative to those of other information providers, influence who the information seeker believes provides a valuable response and how valuable he or she judges the provider's information to be. The authors track information queries, information provider responses, and objective valuation of these responses by information seekers in a Web forum, in which responses to information queries come from multiple information providers with whom the information seeker has not met face-to-face and has had no prior interaction. Among other results, the authors show that a provider's response speed, the extent to which the provider's previous responses within the focal domain have been positively evaluated by others, and the breadth of the provider's previous responses across different domains of knowledge affect objective judgments of information value. Importantly, these effects are moderated by the information seeker's goal orientation. The information provider's experience in responding to questions in different domains of knowledge increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a decision-making orientation, whereas the information provider's reputation for providing valuable contributions within the focal domain increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a learning orientation.",1
Opportunity Cost Overestimation,Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Consumers often fail to utilize desirable offers they had originally selected and planned to use and thus later regret missing out on them. This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to choose arises from external rather than internal constraints, opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time, budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal when that trade-off is ?built-in? (e.g., when a marketing incentive requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate opportunity cost overestimation.",1
The Internationalization Process and Networks: A Strategic Management Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"In this article, a conceptual model is developed that places internationalization and key process dimensions into a longitudinal strategy context. The model follows the internationalization literature with its emphasis on internal organizational processes (such as learning and network development) that drive foreign market expansion, but are also outcomes of it. These internal processes (which feed into the so-called strategic foundation) are linked to the company's strategy mechanisms, thus tying internationalization and strategic management into an interrelated cycle. Networks are analyzed as a subset of the conceptual model, illustrating many of the challenges of taking a strategic approach to internationalization. Although the paper is exploratory in nature, managerial implications of the model in terms of effective servicing of foreign markets are discussed.",0
The Importance of Networks in Export Promotion: Policy Issues,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"Although the field of networks has been the subject of extensive investigation, there has been little application to policy issues connected with the internationalization of companies. This is despite the emergence of so-called network schemes in many countries, which aim at building cooperative links between small companies to exploit wider market possibilities, including those in the global arena. This article, through the evaluation of a new export promotion scheme, specifically addresses the policy issues arising when networks are both the means to achieve international market outcomes and the outcomes themselves, that is, part of the foundation for ongoing international market penetration. Furthermore, it is argued that network outcomes should be included as part of the criteria for evaluating the success of export promotion schemes.",0
Inward-Outward Connections in Internationalization,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This article examines the impact of inward and outward aspects of internationalization. The effect of the inward process on outward moves has been the subject of limited research, although some evidence from studies of licensing and franchising in Australia suggests inward steps can sometimes play an important preparatory role in the outward process. Governments have for some time used inward international flows to force a reverse process?through strict countertrade policies, for example, or, as in the Australian case through its ?partnership scheme.? An important public policy question is how to regard international steps in any outward promotional scheme. For example, among individual firms there is a need to use inward moves in a more productive way to promote outward internationalization, perhaps by selecting foreign suppliers in part on the basis of their ability to contribute to an outward strategy.",0
Product Development Resources and the Scope of the Firm,Journal of Marketing,2005,"This article examines the relationship between a firm's strength in product development and its optimal scope. Firms with product development strength have two options: They can leverage it in horizontally related markets, and they can reach into the supply chain to take full advantage of it. The question is how this should be done. One possibility is for the firm to expand its scope, and another is to manage the linkage through contracts. On the basis of the adjustment cost theory of the firm, the author argues that the former solution is more appropriate when product development is fast-paced. This study tests the argument in a sample of several thousand firms and reports four tests. For both types of expansion, the author examines the incidence and the productivity of increased scope. The author uses several measures and finds results that are consistent with the theory.",0
Measuring Consumers' Willingness to Pay at the Point of Purchase,Journal of Marketing Research,2002,"Economists, psychologists, and marketing researchers rely on measures of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) in estimating demand for private and public goods and in designing optimal price schedules. Existing market research techniques for measuring WTP differ in whether they provide an incentive to consumers to reveal their true WTP and in whether they simulate actual point-of-purchase contexts. The authors present an empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP. In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding. They also control for strategic response behavior.",1
The Influence of Regulatory Focus on Global Consumption Orientation and Preference for Global versus Local Consumer Culture Positioning,Journal of International Marketing,2016,"Firms increasingly employ global and local consumer culture positioning strategies (GCCP/LCCP), but understanding of the drivers that underlie consumer responses to such strategies is limited, leaving firms with little guidance on when to choose one strategy over another. To shed light on consumer preference for GCCP versus LCCP, the authors examine the effects of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention orientation) and global consumption orientation (GCO) on preference for GCCP/LCCP. They report the results of three studies: the first is based on a survey with samples drawn from the United States and China, and the second and third are behavioral designs manipulating situational promotion and prevention regulatory focus. The findings suggest that promotion focus is positively related to GCO and prevention focus is negatively related to GCO. Furthermore, the authors find that GCO is positively related to a preference for GCCP. Thus, this research offers a unique perspective by introducing regulatory focus to the GCCP literature, identifying GCO as an important mediator, and demonstrating that regulatory focus can be situationally activated.",0
Export Performance: A Focus on Discretionary Adaptation,Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Marketing adaptation strategy has been characterized as a strategic imperative in markets with protectionist and nationalist sentiments, which underscores the need to better understand the effects of adaptation strategy. However, empirical investigations of international marketing strategy have considered mandatory and discretionary adaptations as equivalent. Discretionary adaptations, unlike mandatory adaptations, involve choice; thus, they are more relevant to the selection of an international marketing strategy. This article focuses on the direct and conditional effects of discretionary adaptation on export performance. Analyzing data from 203 U.S. small and medium-sized enterprises, the authors find a positive effect of discretionary adaptation on export performance as well as moderating effects of (1) a market characteristic (psychic distance), (2) a firm characteristic (international experience), and (3) a product characteristic (product positional advantage). The implications suggest that adaptation strategy may be more advantageous than previously thought, and that researchers should focus on discretionary adaptations when investigating the choice of a relatively standardized versus adapted international marketing strategy.",0
"Eastern versus Western Culture Pricing Strategy: Superstition, Lucky Numbers, and Localization",Journal of International Marketing,2017,"Eastern versus Western culture pricing practices differ with respect to price endings; however, Eastern cultures are increasingly influenced by Western multinational corporations. At the same time, increasing antiglobalization sentiment suggests the use of localization strategies in these markets. The authors investigate whether pricing practices still differ in this new environment, examine the role of superstition, and ask whether Western brands can benefit from localizing pricing practices. They explore the use of lucky number price endings and consumer responses to such pricing strategies in Singapore, an Eastern culture that is strongly exposed to Western multinational influence. Using a content analysis of newspaper advertisements and two experiments, the authors find that superstitious pricing practices continue, especially with high-priced items and brands of Eastern (vs. Western) origin. In the experimental studies, they find that superstitious pricing has a positive effect on price attractiveness and that foreign brands that localize their prices benefit from a more positive brand attitude.",0
Responsiveness to Global and Local Consumer Culture Positioning: A Personality and Collective Identity Perspective,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Marketers have increasingly employed positioning strategies to appeal to either global or local consumer cultures. However, little is known about the characteristics of consumers most likely to respond to such positioning. The authors find that the collective identities of global and national identification are strongly related to responsiveness to global and local consumer culture positioning (GCCP and LCCP, respectively). The results also show that personality predisposes people to adopt collective identities. The personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness are significantly related to global and national identity, respectively. On the basis of these findings, the authors present implications with regard to developing GCCP and LCCP strategies that are congruent with consumers? personality and associated collective identity.",0
Gratitude versus Entitlement: A Dual Process Model of the Profitability Implications of Customer Prioritization,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Customer prioritization strategies, which focus a firm's efforts on its most important customers, are expected to improve account profitability. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that such strategies may also undermine account profitability by inducing customers to become overly demanding. Building on social exchange theory, this research evaluates these competing perspectives across two field studies and finds that prioritization is best understood as a double-edged sword. Specifically, the results reveal that prioritization efforts initiate both a gratitude-driven process, which enhances sales and profit, and an entitlement-driven process, which increases service costs and reduces profit. Importantly, the findings indicate that prioritization tactics differ in the extent to which they trigger these competing processes and thus in their ability to influence account profitability. Finally, the results also reveal that critical moderators (competitive intensity and prioritization transparency) determine the extent to which the entitlement-driven process undermines the gratitude-driven process. For managers, the findings suggest that both the tactics employed and moderating conditions determine whether prioritization has a positive, negative, or negligible effect on prioritized accounts? profitability.",0
"Market Situation Interpretation and Response: The Role of Cognitive Style, Organizational Culture, and Information Use",Journal of Marketing,2003,"Improving marketing decision making requires a better understanding of the factors that influence how managers interpret and respond to a market situation. Building on extant literature, the authors develop a model that delineates antecedents of and responses to the interpretation of a market situation. Using case-scenario methodology, the authors test the model in the context of a marketing decision (annual advertising and promotion budget recommendation) with data collected from a nationwide sample of hospital marketing executives. The results of the partial least squares analysis show that (1) cognitive style, organizational culture, and information use affect the extent to which managers perceive a given market situation as one in which they can control the outcomes of their decision; (2) the more managers perceive a situation as controllable, the more they appraise that situation as an opportunity; and (3) the more managers appraise a situation as an opportunity, the greater is the magnitude of their response.",0
How to SHIFT Consumer Behaviors to be More Sustainable: A Literature Review and Guiding Framework,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Highlighting the important role of marketing in encouraging sustainable consumption, the current research presents a review of the academic literature from marketing and behavioral science that examines the most effective ways to shift consumer behaviors to be more sustainable. In the process of the review, the authors develop a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing and encouraging sustainable consumer behavior change. The framework is represented by the acronym SHIFT, and it proposes that consumers are more inclined to engage in pro-environmental behaviors when the message or context leverages the following psychological factors: Social influence, Habit formation, Individual self, Feelings and cognition, and Tangibility. The authors also identify five broad challenges to encouraging sustainable behaviors and use these to develop novel theoretical propositions and directions for future research. Finally, the authors outline how practitioners aiming to encourage sustainable consumer behaviors can use this framework.",0
When Do Consumers Avoid Imperfections? Superficial Packaging Damage as a Contamination Cue,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"Across six experiments, the authors demonstrate that superficial imperfections in the form of packaging damage can engender negative consumer reactions that shape subsequent attitudes and behaviors in ways that are not always objectively justified. Their findings show that these reactions function in a relatively automatic fashion, even emerging under conditions in which the packaging damage does not convey information about a health and safety threat from the product. The authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these thoughts of contamination. This can be done with positive brand associations (i.e., by branding the product as organic) or by creating a physical buffer between the packaging damage and the product itself. The authors close with a discussion of implications for marketers, consumers, and public policy makers.",1
It's the Mind-Set that Matters: The Role of Construal Level and Message Framing in Influencing Consumer Efficacy and Conservation Behaviors,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Across three studies, this research elucidates when loss- versus gain-framed messages are most effective in influencing consumer recycling by examining the moderating role of whether a more concrete or abstract mind-set is activated. First, in a field study, the authors demonstrate that loss frames are more efficacious when paired with low-level, concrete mind-sets, whereas gain frames are more effective when paired with high-level, abstract mind-sets. This is an important, substantive finding that persisted over a significant time span. in addition, in two additional laboratory studies, they find further evidence for this matching hypothesis, in which a pairing of loss- (gain-) framed messages that activates more concrete (abstract) mind-sets leads to enhanced processing fluency, increased efficacy, and, as a result, more positive recycling intentions. The findings have implications for marketers, consumers, and society as a whole.",1
Belief in a Just World: Consumer Intentions and Behaviors toward Ethical Products,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Although consumers report positive attitudes toward ethical goods, their intentions and behaviors often do not follow suit. Just-world theory highlights the conditions under which consumers are most likely to prefer fair-trade products. This theory proposes that people are motivated to construe the world as a just place where people get what they deserve. In the current research, when people are confronted with high levels of injustice (communicated need is high) and avenues for justice restoration seem uncertain or unavailable, assisting others by supporting fair trade decreases. However, highlighting how injustice can be redressed through purchases enhances fair-trade support under conditions of high need. The effects are moderated by justice sensitivity factors, such as just-world beliefs and whether the product type (indulgence vs. necessity) makes the injustice of consumer privilege salient. The results suggest that communicating high need when requesting consumer prosocial actions can sometimes backfire. Marketers employing high need appeals should heighten perceptions of justice restoration potential and activate fairness-related thoughts through product positioning to encourage fair-trade purchases.",0
Self-Benefit versus Other-Benefit Marketing Appeals: Their Effectiveness in Generating Charitable Support,Journal of Marketing,2009,"Despite the growing need, nonprofit organization marketers have not yet fully delineated the most effective ways to position charitable appeals. Across five experiments, the authors test the prediction that other-benefit (self-benefit) appeals generate more favorable donation support than self-benefit (other-benefit) appeals in situations that heighten (versus minimize) public self-image concerns. Public accountability, a manipulation of public self-awareness, and individual differences in public self-consciousness all moderate the effect of appeal type on donor support. In particular, self-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers? responses are private in nature; in contrast, other-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers are publicly accountable for their responses. This effect is moderated by norm salience and is related to a desire to manage impressions by behaving in a manner consistent with normative expectations. The results have important managerial implications, suggesting that rather than simply relying on one type of marketing appeal across situations, marketers should tailor their marketing message to the situation or differentially activate public self-image concerns to match the appeal type.",0
When Do (and Don't) Normative Appeals Influence Sustainable Consumer Behaviors?,Journal of Marketing,2013,"The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as ?grasscycling? and composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers.",0
The Motivating Role of Dissociative Out-Groups in Encouraging Positive Consumer Behaviors,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Previous research has found that people tend to avoid products or behaviors that are linked to dissociative reference groups. The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer's group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the results highlight conditions under which communicating information about the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers to engage in positive actions.",1
The Reality of the Eurobrand: An Empirical Analysis,Journal of International Marketing,1995,"This article considers the issue of the globalization of brands, relating the concept to the European arena. While the evidence for global brands is mixed, in Europe the opening up of the Single Market suggests opportunities for marketers to reap the benefits of harmonization of laws relating to advertising, the development of pan-European media, and ?reciprocity.? Through empirical research of the 100 top UK brands in consumer non-durables, this study examines the preponderance of pan-European brands and discovers what modifications are needed to the marketing strategy of a brand to achieve pan-European sales. It also presents the factors that are considered to have most influenced these modifications. A definition of the term ?pan-European,? from the point of view of the respondents themselves, is also offered.",0
When and how Board Members with Marketing Experience Facilitate Firm Growth,Journal of Marketing,2018,"Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms? board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact of MEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find that MEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage.",0
Can Advertising Investments Counter the Negative Impact of Shareholder Complaints on Firm Value?,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Shareholder complaints put pressure on publicly listed firms, yet firms rarely directly address the actual issues raised in these complaints. The authors examine whether firms respond in an alternative way by altering advertising investments in an effort to ward off the financial damage associated with shareholder complaints. By analyzing a unique data set of shareholder complaints submitted to S&P 1500 firms between 2001 and 2016, supplemented with qualitative interviews of executives of publicly listed firms, the authors document that firms increase advertising investments following shareholder complaints and that such an advertising investment response mitigates a postcomplaint decline in firm value. Furthermore, results suggest that firms are more likely to increase advertising investments when shareholder complaints are submitted by institutional investors, pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and relate to topics that receive high media attention. The findings provide new insights on how firms address stock market adversities with advertising investments and inform managers about the effectiveness of such a response.",0
Going Public: How Stock Market Listing Changes Firm Innovation Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Although going public allows firms access to more financial capital that can fuel innovation, it also exposes them to a set of myopic incentives and disclosure requirements that constrain innovation. This tension is expected to produce a unique pattern of innovation strategies among firms going public, causing such firms to increase their innovation levels but reduce their innovation riskiness. Specifically, the authors predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories. The authors compare 40,000 product introductions in the period 1980?2011 from a sample of consumer packaged goods firms that went public with a benchmark sample of firms that remained private, and the results support their predictions. Utilizing tests to resolve questions about endogeneity, including self-selection, reverse causality, and competing explanations, the authors demonstrate that initial public offering selection and dynamics do not drive this going-public effect. The authors also uncover a set of industry factors that mitigate the drop in breakthrough innovation by offering product-market incentives that counterbalance the documented effect of stock market incentives.",1
The Role of Leaders in Internal Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2009,"There is little empirical research on internal marketing despite its intuitive appeal and anecdotal accounts of its benefits. Adopting a social identity theory perspective, the authors propose that internal marketing is fundamentally a process in which leaders instill into followers a sense of oneness with the organization, formally known as ?organizational identification? (OI). The authors test the OI-transfer research model in two multinational studies using multilevel and multisource data. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses show that the OI-transfer process takes place in the relationships between business unit managers and salespeople and between regional directors and business unit managers. Furthermore, both leader-follower dyadic tenure and charismatic leadership moderate this cascading effect. Leaders with a mismatch between their charisma and OI ultimately impair followers? OI. In turn, customer-contact employees? OI strongly predicts their sales performance. Finally, both employees? and sales managers? OI are positively related to their business units? financial performance. The study provides empirical evidence for the role of leaders, especially middle managers, in building member identification that lays the foundation for internal marketing.",0
"Willing to Pay More, Eager to Pay Less: The Role of Customer Loyalty in Price Negotiations",Journal of Marketing,2014,"This article is the first to empirically examine the effect of customer loyalty in retail price negotiations. Across three field studies and one negotiation experiment, the authors establish what they call the ?loyalty?discount cycle?: in price negotiations with salespeople, loyal customers receive deeper discounts that, in turn, increase customer loyalty, resulting in a downward spiral of a company's price enforcement. The reason for the positive effect of customer loyalty on discount is twofold: (1) loyal customers demand a reward for their loyalty and invoke their elevated perceived negotiation power, and (2) to retain loyal customers, salespeople grant discounts more willingly. Furthermore, the mechanisms are moderated by the basis of a customer's loyalty (price vs. quality) and the length of the relationship between the salesperson and the customer. To escape the loyalty?discount cycle, salespeople can use functional and relational customer-oriented behaviors. The study helps managers and salespeople optimize their price enforcement and servicing of loyal customers.",0
Multiple Identification Foci and Their Countervailing Effects on Salespeople's Negative Headquarters Stereotypes,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Using a large-scale, multilevel data set, this study introduces to the sales management literature the concept of sales representatives' headquarters stereotypes as a negative outcome of social identification. The results suggest that work team identification fosters headquarters stereotyping more strongly when organizational identification is low than when it is high. Salespeople's physical distance from their corporate headquarters increases work team identification and decreases organizational identification. Competitive intensity, as an external threat to salespeople's social identity, strengthens stereotyping and social identification. In addition to important theoretical implications, this research also provides crucial insights for managers. Headquarters stereotypes are critically important because they can have harmful consequences for sales performance and customer satisfaction. Key managerial implications are that managers should foster organizational identification and that using different compensation systems does not remedy the negative effects of stereotypes.",0
Customer Equity: An Integral Part of Financial Reporting,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Recent initiatives demand information that supplements and complements a firm's financial statements to bridge the gap between financial statement capabilities and financial reporting objectives. Such information assists investors' decision making by explaining the main trends and factors that underlie the development, performance, and position of the firm's business. Firms that aim to increase the value of their customer base should report forward-looking customer metrics because such reports align customer management with corporate goals and investors' perspectives. The authors propose a means to report customer equity that enables investors?the ?consumers? of financial reports?to monitor firms' performance with respect to their customer assets. Furthermore, they develop a specific model for Netflix and apply it to quarterly data from September 2001 to September 2006.",0
Leave Home without it? The Effects of Credit Card Debt and Available Credit on Spending,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research examines how credit card debt affects consumer spending. In five experimental and field studies, the authors demonstrate that outstanding credit card debt increases spending for consumers with high self-control. They also show that this effect can be eliminated by increasing the available credit on the credit card. Thus, when the available credit is low, consumers with greater self-control increase spending, but when the available credit is high, they reduce spending. The results extend the literature on goal violation and self-control and offer insights into consumer decision making and consumption patterns under conditions of debt.",1
Why Do Consumers Buy Counterfeit Luxury Brands?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This research demonstrates that consumers? desire for counterfeit luxury brands hinges on the social motivations (i.e., to express themselves and/or to fit in) underlying their luxury brand preferences. In particular, the authors show that both consumers? preferences for a counterfeit brand and the subsequent negative change in their preferences for the real brand are greater when their luxury brand attitudes serve a social-adjustive rather than a value-expressive function. In addition, consumers? moral beliefs about counterfeit consumption affect their counterfeit brand preferences only when their luxury brand attitudes serve a value-expressive function. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the social functions served by consumers? luxury brand attitudes can be influenced by elements of the marketing mix (e.g., product design, advertising), thus enabling marketers to curb the demand for counterfeit brands through specific marketing-mix actions.",1
Discrepant Fluency in Self-Customization,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This research demonstrates that during self-customization, consumers use their experiences from prior feature decisions to form expectations about subsequent decisions. When the difficulty experienced during decisions later in the process deviates from that which occurs earlier in the process, consumer preference is affected by the discrepancy between actual and expected difficulty. Specifically, the results show that when the difficulty experienced during feature decisions deviates from expectations, consumers may spend more or less money on product features as a result of discrepant fluency than when they perform the same task and the level of difficulty is expected. The results demonstrate that discrepant fluency effects are not limited to sequential decisions but can influence a single feature decision, which was accomplished by altering consumers? expectations before the decision. These discrepant fluency effects emerge even when the attributes of the alternatives and the composition of the focal decision settings remain the same.",1
The Worth of Product Placement in Successful Films: An Event Study Analysis,Journal of Marketing,2009,"As a result of the diminishing effectiveness of broadcast advertising, firms are increasingly turning to product placements in films and television to promote their products. A growing stream of product placement research has conducted surveys of consumer and practitioner views on the practice and experiments to gauge product placement's impact on brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent. However, there is no evidence of whether firms? investments in film product placements are worthwhile. The event study of 126 product placements in successful films during 2002 reveals a mean cumulative abnormal return of .89% during the film's opening, indicating that product placement in a successful film is associated with positive movements in firm stock prices. Cross-sectional analysis of the returns offers new insight into how product, film, and execution factors influence the placement's worth. The authors find that placement abnormal returns are enhanced by tie-in advertising and brand equity but are inhibited by audience absorption, critical acclaim, and violent film content. Placement modality, character associations, and blatancy also significantly affect the placement's value.",0
The Effect of Brand Acquisition and Disposal on Stock Returns,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Brand acquisitions and disposals are key strategic marketing decisions and often the largest single marketing investments that firms make. Yet little is known about the performance effects of such decisions. This study examines stock market reactions to brand acquisition and disposal announcements in 31 consumer industries. The results reveal that returns to such announcements depend crucially on three complementary firm assets?marketing capabilities, channel relationships, and brand portfolios?but that these effects may not be symmetric across brand acquisitions and disposals. Acquirer abnormal returns are greater for firms with strong marketing capabilities and those that buy brands with higher price/quality positioning than their existing portfolio. Investors also reward buyers that identify cost synergies in integrating new brand(s) into their portfolios but punish those that identify revenue synergies. Conversely, greater abnormal returns arise for sellers with inferior channel relationships and for those selling multiple brands, brands with relatively lower price/quality positioning than the seller's remaining portfolio, and brands unrelated to the rest of the seller's portfolio. The results from a paired subsample provide new knowledge about the positive net shareholder wealth created from brand acquisition?disposal transactions and indicate a strong role of marketing capabilities in creating this wealth.",0
Perspectives: Multicultural Marketing in Australia: Synergy in Diversity,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"Australia's multicultural society presents challenges and opportunities for marketers. This article presents a framework for analyzing multicultural marketing in terms of the interrelations among three types of factors, that is, the multicultural marketplace in Australia, international markets, and the multicultural resources that exist in Australia. The authors argue that Australia's cultural diversity, as well as that of other multicultural societies, is a valuable resource for recognizing and responding to the opportunities presented in international markets. Several case studies are used to illustrate the ways in which opportunities in the domestic and international marketplace can arise and be responded to as a result of the multicultural dimensions of a society. The cases are drawn from winning entries in the annual Australian Multicultural Marketing Awards. Although developed in terms of Australian society, the ideas are relevant to all culturally heterogeneous societies.",0
"Government Effectiveness, the Global Financial Crisis, and Multinational Enterprise Internationalization",Journal of International Marketing,2012,"This study examines the influence of national institutions on multinational enterprise entry mode behavior during economic downturns. Drawing on institutional and transaction cost theories, the authors propose (1) alternative hypotheses for the effect of host-country government effectiveness (a spatial institution) and (2) hypotheses for a direct and an indirect effect of a global financial crisis (a temporal event affecting all countries) on firms? internationalization strategy. With a sample comprising 624 foreign expansion investments conducted by Dutch multinational enterprises between 2004 and 2009 into 66 countries, this investigation confirms that majority control more likely occurs when host-country government effectiveness is high or when the investment is made during a global financial crisis. The authors also find support for a hypothesized moderating effect of a global financial crisis. Concluding remarks discuss the implications of these findings for scholars and practitioners.",0
Executive Insights: Researching Markets in Japan?A Methodological Case Study,Journal of International Marketing,1996,"Foreigners studying markets in Japan face different sets of problems from those encountered in their own, familiar, domestic markets. They have to cope with the nuances of a different language, alien perceptions, different role expectations, and personal inexperience in business and social etiquette. There are unexpected difficulties with access to both published information and target respondents, and some may find they are on the receiving end of a program of deliberate disinformation. This case history is based on the author's recent decade of experiences in studying food markets in Japan. Attention is focused on some difficult methodological problems, and strategies and approaches are offered to maximize the quality of information obtained.",0
An Exploratory Study of the Functional Forms of Export Market Identification Variables,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"Exploratory research demonstrates that the import market potential, import market competitiveness, and ?barriers-to-imports? variables can be successfully integrated into a shift-share framework for identifying export markets. The authors present managerial implications for global competitive strategy in exporting.",0
Attracting Foreign Direct Investment: Applying Dunning's Location Advantages Framework to FDI Advertising,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"Countries compete intensely for foreign direct investment (FDI) and perform a wide range of activities to attract it. Research on FDI promotion often overlooks the effects of advertising. To fill this gap in the literature, this study analyzes the content of FDI advertising to explain its structure. To guide the analysis, the authors use Dunning's FDI location advantages framework. This framework represents an effective prism through which to view FDI advertising, and Dunning's location advantages are reflected in advertising content. In an effort to shed more light on FDI advertising, the authors first provide an assessment of how advertising content varies by country income classification. Next, using exploratory factor analysis, they identify the five factors represented in FDI advertising: knowledge resources, market attractiveness, economic governance, infrastructure, and natural resources. The findings suggest that high-income countries tend to focus on knowledge resources, while lower-middle-income countries focus on economic governance. Upper-middle-income countries tap into both knowledge resources and economic governance while also promoting the attractiveness of their market.",0
"Warm Glow or Cold, Hard Cash? Social Identity Effects on Consumer Choice for Donation versus Discount Promotions",Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Across five studies, the authors investigate how social identification influences consumer preference for discount-based promotions (i.e., cents-off deals) versus donation-based promotions (in which purchase results in a donation to a charitable cause). In doing so, they demonstrate the interplay between self-construal and a specific social identity (i.e., that associated with the particular charity featured in a donation-based promotion) on consumers' preferences for these two types of promotions. The results show that, in general, consumers possessing interdependent self-construals prefer donations to a greater extent than those with independent self-construals. However, the findings further indicate that these effects of self-construal are attenuated if (1) the donation-based promotion does not involve a charity that is identity congruent or (2) a cause-congruent identity is more salient than self-construal at the time of decision making. The authors also identify boundary conditions of charity efficiency and product type for these self-construal effects. In addition to demonstrating how multiple identities interact to influence consumer promotion preferences, the authors discuss important managerial implications regarding the use of discount versus donation-based promotions.",1
When Celebrities Count: Power Distance Beliefs and Celebrity Endorsements,Journal of Marketing,2018,"The use of celebrity endorsements varies across countries; does their effectiveness similarly vary across cultures? The authors propose that power distance beliefs (PDB), a cultural orientation related to the extent to which people expect and accept differences in power, moderate the effects of celebrity endorsements. A positive effect of celebrity endorsers on evaluations of advertising should be more potent with greater PDB; source expertise and trustworthiness likely underlie this effect. To test the hypotheses, the authors use moderated mediation analyses, with corrections for measurement error and endogeneity of the mediators (source expertise and trustworthiness). The results of three studies, using both manipulated and measured PDB for respondents in different countries and with a variety of endorsers, demonstrate that PDB determine the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements on attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand. In support of the moderated mediation model, perceptions of source expertise and trust mediate the effect of celebrity endorsements, conditional on PDB. The results hold for nondurables but do not generalize to durable products.",0
When Does Recognition Increase Charitable Behavior? Toward a Moral Identity-Based Model,Journal of Marketing,2013,"Each year, people in the United States donate more than $200 billion to charitable causes. Despite the lack of understanding of whether and how recognition increases charitable behavior, charities often offer it to motivate donor action. This research focuses on how the effectiveness of recognition on charitable behavior is dependent on the joint influence of two distinct dimensions of moral identity: internalization and symbolization. Three studies examining both monetary donations and volunteering behavior show that recognition increases charitable behavior among those characterized by high moral identity symbolization and low moral identity internalization. Notably, those who show high levels of moral identity internalization are uninfluenced by recognition, regardless of their symbolization. By understanding correlates of the two dimensions of moral identity among donors, nonprofits can strategically recognize potential donors to maximize donation and volunteering behavior.",0
Knowing What It Makes: How Product Transformation Salience Increases Recycling,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Recycling campaigns abound, but do consumers think about what becomes of those recyclables? This research proposes that product transformation salience (thinking about recyclables turning into new products) increases recycling. The authors theorize that consumers are inspired by the transformation of recyclables into new products and that this inspiration motivates them to recycle. The authors demonstrate the effect of product transformation messages on recycling behavior using a recycling campaign (Study 1) and advertisements for products made from recycled plastic (Study 2). Study 3 demonstrates the mediating role of inspiration. Then, three field studies provide robust support for the transformation salience effect through click-through rates for recycling advertisements (Study 4), recycling rates during pre?football game tailgating (Study 5), and a reduction in the amount of recyclable materials incorrectly placed in the landfill bin by students in a university residence hall (Study 6). The authors discuss implications for the design of recycling campaigns and positioning of recycled products in the marketplace as well as theoretical contributions regarding the roles of transformation salience and inspiration in encouraging recycling and other sustainable behaviors.",0
Keeping the Memory but Not the Possession: Memory Preservation Mitigates Identity Loss from Product Disposition,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Nonprofit firms? reliance on donations to build inventory distinguishes them from traditional retailers. This reliance on consumer donations means that these organizations face an inherently more volatile supply chain than retailers that source inventory from manufacturers. The authors propose that consumer reluctance to part with possessions with sentimental value causes a bottleneck in the donation process. The goal of this research is therefore to provide nonprofits with tools to increase donations of used goods and provide a theoretical link between the literature streams on prosocial behavior, disposition, memory, and identity. As such, the authors explore the effectiveness of memory preservation strategies (e.g., taking a photo of a good before donating it) in increasing donations to nonprofits. A field study using a donation drive demonstrates that encouraging consumers to take photos of sentimental possessions before donating them increases donations, and five laboratory experiments explicate this result by mapping the proposed psychological process behind the success of memory preservation techniques. Specifically, these techniques operate by ameliorating consumers? perceived identity loss when considering donation of sentimental goods.",0
Inferring Corporate Motives: How Deal Characteristics Shape Sponsorship Perceptions,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Sponsoring joins brands with sports, the arts, and events in mutually beneficial partnerships. In the context of sports, the authors examine how sponsorship deal characteristics affect consumer inferences, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward a sponsor and a sport property in a partnership. The authors develop a conceptual framework that links a holistic set of sponsorship deal characteristics (i.e., contract length, regional proximity of the sponsor, sponsorship fee, and sponsorship type) to individual consumer perceptions. Study 1 tests the framework in a field study of 2,787 consumers across 44 sponsorships. Study 2 largely confirms the findings of the field study in an experimental study. Overall, the results show that regionally proximate and long-term partnerships benefit as consumers make positive inferences about partnership fit and sponsor motives. In contrast, consumers associate high sponsorship fees, international sponsors, and naming-rights relationships with calculative motives and perceive these factors negatively. For managers, finding that sponsorship deal characteristics matter is important not only for sponsor?property relationships but also for relationships between the sponsoring brands and consumers.",0
Toward a Process-Transfer Model of the Endorser Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Previous research on the effects of celebrity endorsement has focused on the transfer of positive properties (likeableness, credibility, symbolic meanings, etc.) from the endorser to the product. Taking a different perspective, this study suggests that the way in which consumers evaluate an endorser (i.e., the cognitive process, such as applying family origin or achievement as the basis for evaluation) will carry over to the evaluation of the endorsed product (e.g., applying country of origin or performance as the criteria). Five experiments support this process-transfer account and show that it can be induced by subtle verbal/visual cues in advertisements. Because the process transfer is not inherently associated with positive/negative valence, it provides a theoretical rationale for explaining successful endorsements involving endorsers who are less favorable/credible, less of a ?fit? with the product, or associated with some negative meanings, in addition to those involving positively or neutrally evaluated endorsers. The process-transfer model supplements existing models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of endorser effects. It provides marketers with a set of less stringent guidelines for selecting endorsers as well as valuable damage control tools for brands when an endorser screws up.",1
When Less Is More: How Mindset Influences Consumers? Responses to Products with Reduced Negative Attributes,Journal of Marketing,2020,"Marketing communications often describe a reduction in a product?s negative attributes (e.g., ?our mineral water now uses 34% less plastic?). This claim may be interpreted as a trend of improving relative to previous state. However, such a claim may also call attention to a negative product feature that might have otherwise been overlooked. The authors suggest that whether consumers are positively or negatively influenced by such claims depends on whether the claims are interpreted through an incremental or entity mindset. When a reduction in negative attributes is viewed through an incremental mindset?the tendency to think of attributes as malleable?a trend-based interpretation results in improved product evaluations. In contrast, an entity mindset that emphasizes attributes are unlikely to change produces a negative effect for the claim. Four experiments and a field survey (N = 2,543) across food, pharmaceuticals, and plastic bottle products confirm the effects and indicate that the effects diminish when consumers believe the attribute is easy to eliminate or when the attribute has extremely threatening consequences. The opposite is observed for claims of reduced positive attributes, such that an entity mindset produces more positive evaluations. The findings offer marketers consumer insights to guide the communication of negatively framed attributes.",0
Remote Purchase Environments: The Influence of Return Policy Leniency on Two-Stage Decision Processes,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"The growth of catalog sales and the enormous potential of e-commerce elevates the importance of understanding remote purchase. Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks-and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer. Results from three experiments provide support for the idea that product ownership depends more on perception than possession.",1
From Fear to Loathing? How Emotion Influences the Evaluation and Early Use of Innovations,Journal of Marketing,2006,"Innovation adoption is rarely a short process for consumers; accordingly, recent research has explored adoption as a dynamic process that is characterized by changing patterns, or diffusion, of consumer use of the innovation. This research suggests that adoption is rarely a neutral process and that consumers can experience strong emotions in the initial use of innovations. However, given such emotions, two opposing arguments can be made as to whether the inclusion of emotional responses increases the predictive power of traditional models of diffusion. On the one hand, experienced emotion may simply be a function of gained benefits and, as such, may already be captured in extant models through cognitive assessments of net benefits. On the other hand, and as data from two empirical and longitudinal studies demonstrate, the learning process is potentially emotion generating (independent of net benefits), and this emotion colors product evaluations. The emotional influence is sizable and, importantly, not a straightforward case of ?easier is better.? In this work, the authors present the E3 (expectation ? emotion ? evaluation) model, which describes how managers can better predict and influence the successful diffusion of complex technological products.",0
The Marketing Challenges of the Newly Independent Republics: Product Competitiveness in Global Markets,Journal of International Marketing,1993,"This article focuses on the entry of Central and Eastern European republics into the mainstream of global markets, which are highly competitive. For the new republics of the former East Bloc to gain significant market shares in global markets, their products and the marketing of those products must achieve world class standards in every respect. Using empirical evidence gathered from Finnish consumers from 1975 to 1990, this research addresses several fundamental questions including: How are products and marketing practices from the former USSR (and by inference the new republics) perceived by Finnish consumers? How have such perceptions changed over time, and how do they compare to their perceptions of Western competitors? Which marketing dimensions contribute most to product preferences of Finnish consumers, with respect to international alternatives? And finally, where should the new republics concentrate their future marketing efforts in order to improve their competitiveness? Results indicate that Finnish preferences are influenced most by ?central product attributes? and ?marketing practices satisfiers.?",0
Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Drug Therapy Compliance,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Because of their arm's-length relationship with patients, pharmaceutical manufacturers have been interested in whether drug advertising can improve therapy compliance. Contrary to many industry surveys, the author finds that the impact is small in economic terms, the effect spills over to other brands, and, in certain cases, the effect may decrease average compliance rates.",1
Technology as an Enabler of the Global Branding of Retail Financial Services,Journal of International Marketing,2002,The market for retail financial services has been transformed in the past decade by new distribution and processing technologies and their impact on consumer attitudes to banking and banks. These factors have removed the geographic and cost barriers to the global distribution of retail financial services and have led to a convergence in the key benefits sought by consumers in developed countries. This increases the need for and the effectiveness of globally consistent brand images.,0
Understanding Earliness of Internationalization and Its Impact on Postentry Geographic Diversity of International Young Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,2018,"Early and rapid internationalization has emerged as an established phenomenon of research, yet several fundamental issues remain to be studied. In this research, the authors aim to analyze the link between earliness of internationalization?a temporal dimension of foreign market entry?and the geographic diversity of international expansion, as well as the contingent nature of the relationship. They test their hypotheses with empirical data collected in a survey among international young ventures in China. The results show that while earliness of internationalization does not directly lead to the geographic diversity of a venture's international expansion, its impact becomes salient as the venture gains international legitimacy and strategic flexibility. Furthermore, the moderating effects of international legitimacy and strategic flexibility vary according to the type of the venture's first foreign market (regional vs. global). This research advances the knowledge not only of the important role of early foreign market entry but also of the strategic factors for paths created by accelerated internationalization. It potentially contributes to the emergent research on foreign market entry timing/speed of internationalization and performance implications of international young ventures.",0
In God's Hands: How Reminders of God Dampen the Effectiveness of Fear Appeals,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"To begin building an understanding of how thoughts about God influence consumer persuasion processes and outcomes, the current research explores how reminders of God affect consumer compliance with fear-based advertising. Results across seven studies demonstrate that when the concept of God is salient, consumer compliance and persuasion in response to fear appeals is dampened. Importantly, the results suggest that one reason for this persuasion-dampening effect of God salience is the fact that consumers associate the concept of God with the idea of unlimited support. Consistent with this, the results reveal that when God is not associated with the idea of support, the dampening effect of God salience on fear appeal compliance is eliminated.",1
How Asking ?Who am I?? Affects what Consumers Buy: The Influence of Self-Discovery on Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"Are you type A or type B? An optimist or a pessimist? Intuitive or analytical? Consumers are motivated to learn about the self, but they may not always accept what they learn. This article explores how the desire for self-discovery leads people to seek but not necessarily accept the feedback they receive and the implications this has for consumption behavior. Specifically, this article examines the case of consumers who value being unconstrained: people with independent self-construals and those who have high levels of reactance motivation. The authors argue that these people often view self-knowledge as a constraint on the self and subsequently reject it?even when the self-knowledge has neutral or positive implications for self-esteem. Results across five studies demonstrate that independents and high reactants feel constrained by self-knowledge, and this causes them to reject and make consumption choices inconsistent with it even as they actively seek to learn about themselves. In contrast, interdependents and low reactants do not feel constrained by self-knowledge, and consequently, they accept and incorporate it into their consumption decisions.",1
Brand Name Types and Consumer Demand: Evidence from China?s Automobile Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Brand naming challenges are more complex in logographic languages (e.g., Chinese), compared with phonographic languages (e.g., English) because the former languages feature looser correspondence between sound and meaning. With these two dimensions of sound and meaning, the authors propose a four-way categorization of brand name types for logographic languages: alphanumeric, phonetic, phonosemantic, or semantic. Using automobile sales data from China and a discrete choice model for differentiated products, the authors relate brand name types to demand, with evidence showing that Chinese consumers preferred vehicle models with semantic brand names (7.64% more sales than alphanumeric) but exhibited the least preference for phonosemantic names (4.92% lower sales than alphanumeric). Domestic Chinese firms benefited from semantic brand names, whereas foreign firms gained from using foreign-sounding brand names. Entry-level products performed better with semantic brand names, and high-end products excelled when they had foreign-sounding brand names. Thus, the four-way categorization of brand name types should help multinational firms and domestic Chinese firms understand and leverage the association between brand name types and consumer demand.",1
When is a Preannounced New Product Likely to be Delayed?,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Consider that a firm announces a deadline for a new product introduction. Conditional on such a preannouncement, how must an external observer evaluate whether the product will be delayed beyond that deadline? Using data collected from managers in the computer hardware, software, and telecommunications industries, the authors present an analysis that demonstrates that delays in new product introductions beyond preannounced deadlines can be jointly explained by factors related to (1) the firm's motivations to delay the product, (2) the presence of constraints that prevent delay (or the availability of opportunities to delay the product), and (3) the firm's abilities pertaining to product development.",0
Matchmaker Competition and Technology Provision,Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"Matchmaking is a complex process that requires considerable expertise. Matchmakers in various industries often advertise proprietary technologies that presumably help users find an ideal match in a short time. However, matchmakers may have incentives to provide suboptimal matchmaking services so that users remain clients longer and pay more fees. This article considers a matchmaking market with network effects and strategic consumers and analyzes under what conditions matchmakers would offer more effective versus less effective matchmaking services. The authors find that stronger pricing power paradoxically leads to lower technology provision when consumers have high valuation for the matchmaking service. Moreover, network effects typically encourage matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking. In addition, consumer patience prompts competing matchmakers to implement ineffective technology. In two extensions, the authors explore asymmetric two-sided markets and discuss the impacts of alternative pricing schemes on technology provision.",1
Instant Customer Base Analysis: Managerial Heuristics Often ?Get it Right?,Journal of Marketing,2008,"Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the information these models provide, customer managers should be able to (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care. Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models managerially more useful.",0
Portfolios of Interfirm Agreements in Technology-Intensive Markets: Consequences for Innovation and Profitability,Journal of Marketing,2004,"Despite the high relevance of firms? portfolios of upstream interfirm agreements in technology-intensive markets, little is known about their impact on innovative success. The authors develop a conceptual framework that explains the consequences of different portfolio descriptors for radical innovation, incremental innovation, and profitability. An empirical test in the pharmaceutical industry shows strong support for the developed theory.",0
The Formation of Buyer?Supplier Relationships: Detailed Contract Drafting and Close Partner Selection,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Firms face two strategic decisions when engaging in a new purchase transaction: the decision whether to draft a detailed contract and the decision whether to select a partner with which they share a close tie. The authors study how organizational culture affects these decisions and the effectiveness of these decisions in curtailing the partner's opportunistic behavior. The results suggest that organizational culture exerts an important but different influence on both decisions. Selecting a close partner shows a marked ability to hedge against partner opportunism, but beyond a certain point, it encourages the opportunism it is designed to discourage. Contracting becomes effective only when a nonclose partner is selected and when the focal relationship is embedded in a network of close mutual contacts.",0
Vertical Marketing Systems for Complex Products: A Triadic Perspective,Journal of Marketing Research,2004,"Products that require extensive and complex information flows among suppliers, intermediary vendors, and customers often pose particular challenges to the vertical marketing system. Using social network theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in previous research.",1
The Price is Unfair! A Conceptual Framework of Price Fairness Perceptions,Journal of Marketing,2004,Recent news coverage on pricing portrays the importance of price fairness. This article conceptually integrates the theoretical foundations of fairness perceptions and summarizes empirical findings on price fairness. The authors identify research issues and gaps in existing knowledge on buyers? perceptions of price fairness. The article concludes with guidelines for managerial practice.,0
"An Extended Model of Preference Formation between Global and Local Brands: The Roles of Identity Expressiveness, Trust, and Affect",Journal of International Marketing,2015,"The authors propose an augmented conceptual model explaining consumer preferences for global brands versus local brands in emerging markets and test the model using data from a Chinese consumer sample. The model adds high brand-identity expressiveness as well as high trust and positive affect toward these brands. The results support these additions and replicate previous findings that brand quality and prestige are important links between perceived brand globalness (PBG) and perceived brand localness (PBL) and favorable behavioral intentions. The most novel finding is that both PBG and PBL can enhance a brand's identity expressiveness. The results establish the mediating roles of these additional variables between PBG/PBL and behavioral intentions and also identify the incremental explanatory value of these additional mediators, which have been neglected in previous global branding research. Furthermore, PBG?which affects behavioral intentions through pathways of brand prestige, trust, and affect?is more influential than PBL, which operates mainly through brand identity expressiveness.",0
Social Capital of Young Technology Firms and Their IPO Values: The Complementary Role of Relevant Absorptive Capacity,Journal of Marketing,2011,"The strategic importance of business-to-business (B2B) relationships is well recognized, but their financial impact remains equivocal. This study links social capital from three types of B2B networks of young technology firms with their initial public offering (IPO) value. The authors identify three relevant types of absorptive capacity that facilitate the transformation of B2B social capital into IPO value. For the transformation to occur, the authors find that young firms need not only the opportunity to access the resources provided by B2B relationships but also the ability to leverage them through the complementary capability?namely, absorptive capacity. They test the hypotheses on a sample of 177 IPOs, and the results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures. As one of the first studies in marketing?finance interface to focus on young firms, the findings provide novel insights, such as the deleterious financial consequence of having marketing and research-and-development B2B relationships without the relevant absorptive capacity. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications regarding communicating the value of absorptive capacity, disclosure of marketing-related information, and the importance of marketing for young technology firms.",0
Asymmetric Roles of Advertising and Marketing Capability in Financial Returns to News: Turning Bad into Good and Good into Great,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"News reports carrying positive or negative sentiment about a firm influence its stock market performance. This study examines how two firm-controllable marketing factors, advertising and marketing capability, moderate the relationship between news stories and firm stock returns. Analysis of a panel data set of more than 7,000 firm-month observations indicates asymmetric and complementary moderating roles of the two marketing variables: advertising reinforces the favorable impact of positive news on abnormal stock returns, and marketing capability mitigates the adverse impact of negative news. Moreover, these moderating effects operate through different stakeholders. Whereas the moderating effect of marketing capability is due to its influence on customers and thus affects the level and volatility of future cash flows, advertising moderates the effect of news through individual investors? attention and response to the news. The econometric analysis accounts for potential endogeneity between news reports, stock returns, and marketing variables, and the results are robust to alternative measures and analysis approaches. The findings suggest the need for managers to broaden their stakeholder focus when evaluating advertising's returns and to communicate the value of marketing capability to investors.",1
News Media Channels: Complements or Substitutes? Evidence from Mobile Phone Usage,Journal of Marketing,2014,"The media industry has undergone a fundamental shift over the past decade as new online distribution channels have proliferated in an unprecedented manner. Although mobile devices have experienced rapid adoption among consumers, their effect on consumer behavior and their subsequent implications for publishers and advertisers have yet to be understood. The authors examine consumers? news consumption behavior on mobile news websites in response to the introduction of a mobile news app. Pseudo-panel analysis based on repeated cross-sectional data suggests that the introduction of a mobile app by a major national media company leads to a significant increase in demand at the corresponding mobile news website. In addition, the authors report that this effect is greater for consumers with (1) greater appreciation for concentrated news content, (2) stronger propensity for a particular political viewpoint, and (3) fewer time constraints. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the adoption of a provider's news app stimulates corresponding mobile news website visits. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for advertisers, media publishers, and policy makers.",0
Mental Representation and Perceived Similarity: How Abstract Mindset Aids Choice from Large Assortments,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"A recent meta-analysis has found that an increase in the size of an assortment has no reliable impact on choice difficulty. Building on a fundamental property of cognition, the authors investigate the link between mental representation and the choice overload effect based on the size of the assortment. They propose that the mental representation of a large assortment changes the perceived similarity of the assortment and consequently affects the degree of choice difficulty. Specifically, when choosing from a large assortment, consumers with an abstract representation perceive the options in the assortment as being more similar and accordingly experience less choice difficulty than those with a concrete representation of the assortment. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",1
Do We Really Need a Reason to Indulge?,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"The authors document consistent discrepancies among consumers? predicted, actual, and remembered feelings related to indulgence episodes and conceptualize the underlying processes. Consistent with previous research, consumers expect more negative and less positive feelings when they indulge without a reason than when they indulge with a reason (Study 1) or when they indulge as a consolation for poor performance than when they indulge as a reward for high effort (Study 2). However, episodic reports pertaining to the last indulgence episode show no influence of having versus not having a reason (Study 1), nor do concurrent reports show a difference between indulging as a consolation and indulging as a reward (Study 2). When asked how they ?usually? feel when indulging with versus without a reason (Study 3), consumers? global memories are consistent with their expectations rather than with their actual experiences. These findings have implications for the conditions under which consumers learn from experience.",1
Price Competition and Endogenous Valuation in Search Advertising,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article studies how to endogenously assess the value of a ?superior? advertising position in the price competition and examines the resulting location competition outcomes and price dispersion patterns. The authors consider a game-theoretic model in which firms compete for advertising positions and then compete in price for customers in a product market. Firms differ in their competence, and positions are differentiated in their prominence, which reflects consumers' online search behavior. They find that when endogenously evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the weaker competitor wins it. Furthermore, the authors show that the bidding outcome might not align with the relative competitive strength, and an advantaged firm might not be able to win the prominent position even when it values that position. They derive two-dimensional equilibrium price dispersion with the realized prices at the same position varying and the expected prices differing across different positions. They find that the expected price in the prominent position might not always be higher, implying that an expensive location does not necessarily lead to expensive products.",1
"The Impact of Strategic Fit among Strategy, Structure, and Processes on Multinational Corporation Performance: A Multimethod Assessment",Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The international marketing literature has produced divergent findings regarding the effect of a standardized marketing strategy on firm performance among large multinational corporations (MNCs). Prior research has typically considered external or environmental factors to reconcile different findings. This study employs multiple perspectives of strategic fit (moderation, mediation, profile deviation, and covariation) to examine the effect of the internal fit among strategy, structure, and processes of MNCs and explores their effects on firm performance. Empirical results based on 206 MNCs support the mediation, profile deviation, and covariation perspectives, but they fail to confirm the moderation perspective.",0
The Decline of Conceptual Articles and Implications for Knowledge Development,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This article presents a framework for understanding and revitalizing the important role of conceptual articles in the development of knowledge in the marketing discipline. An analysis of 30 years (1978?2007) of publishing data from major marketing journals indicates that conceptual articles are declining, despite repeated calls for more emphasis on this form of scholarship. The sharpest decline has occurred in Journal of Marketing (JM), with much of the shift occurring over the past decade. Many substantive areas remain largely unexplored in conceptual articles. Over this 30-year period, conceptual articles published in JM have disproportionately more citations relative to their numbers, attesting to the importance of their role in knowledge development. Addressing the decline of conceptual articles and restoring their synergistic balance with other forms of scholarship will require concerted efforts on several interrelated fronts: the current generation of scholars; doctoral programs and students; journals, reviewers, and review process; and promotion, tenure, and incentive systems.",0
Marketing in Computer-Mediated Environments: Research Synthesis and New Directions,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Although an extensive body of research has emerged on marketing in computer-mediated environments, the literature remains fragmented. As a result, insights and findings have accumulated without an overarching framework to provide structure and guidance to the rapidly increasing research stream, which is detrimental to long-term knowledge development in this area. To address this issue, the authors organize and synthesize findings from the literature using a framework structured around four key interactions in computer-mediated environments: consumer?firm interactions, firm?consumer interactions, consumer?consumer interactions, and firm?firm interactions. The proposed framework serves a valuable organizational function and helps identify a broad spectrum of gaps in the literature to advance the next generation of knowledge development.",0
Managing the Future: CEO Attention and Innovation Outcomes,Journal of Marketing,2007,"The current literature presents a mixed view of top managers, often characterizing them as an impediment to innovation, irrelevant for innovation, or, at best, having an indirect effect on innovation. In contrast, the authors use an attentional perspective to argue that chief executive officers (CEOs) have a positive, direct, and long-term impact on how firms detect, develop, and deploy new technologies over time. The authors test their arguments on longitudinal data from the U.S. retail banking industry. They show that CEO attention is a critical driver of innovation even (1) when the target of attention is not innovation per se but simply future events and external events in a generic sense; (2) when the innovation outcomes occur far in the future (sometimes several years in the future); (3) when the innovation outcomes are conceptually, empirically, and temporally distinct; and (4) in an empirical context (i.e., banking) that is not traditionally viewed as ?high tech? and, thus, innovation centric.",0
An Examination of Exploration and Exploitation Capabilities: Implications for Product Innovation and Market Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2007,"The authors employ the dynamic capabilities perspective to gain a greater understanding of the conversion of firm resources into exploitation and exploration capabilities and the influence of these firm capabilities on firm outcomes. Specifically, they theorize that marketing and technological resources provide a foundation for the establishment of exploitation and exploration capabilities, respectively, and that these dynamic capabilities influence the degree of product innovation and market performance. The theorized relationships, which the authors examine using a survey of 111 U.S. importers, indicate that marketing resources influence an importer's development of exploitation capabilities, whereas technological resources influence the development of exploration capabilities. Furthermore, the authors find that exploitation capabilities provide a foundation for the development of exploration capabilities. They also find that whereas exploitation capabilities are negatively related to the degree of product innovation, exploration capabilities positively influence both the degree of product innovation and market performance. The authors provide implications for international marketing academics and practitioners.",0
Killing Hope with Good Intentions: The Effects of Consolation Prizes on Preference for Lottery Promotions,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"The present research examines how the inclusion of consolation or token prizes influences consumers? valuation of a promotional lottery. Results from four experiments show that consolation prizes lower consumers? expectations of winning the big prize, their valuations of the lottery, and their intentions to participate in the lottery. Because of the high likelihood of attaining the consolation prizes, consumers shift their focus from the value of a big prize to the probability of attaining it. This shift increases the weight given to the probability dimension and results in lowered valuations of the lottery. The first two experiments demonstrate the effect in hypothetical and real choices. In Experiment 3, the authors propose and show a boundary condition for the effect. In Experiment 4, they conduct an exploratory test of the process. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications.",1
A Bounded Rationality Model of Information Search and Choice in Preference Measurement,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"It is becoming increasingly easier for researchers and practitioners to collect eye-tracking data during online preference measurement tasks. The authors develop a dynamic discrete choice model of information search and choice under bounded rationality, which they calibrate using a combination of eye-tracking and choice data. Their model extends Gabaix et al.'s (2006) directed cognition model by capturing fatigue, proximity effects, and imperfect memory encoding and by estimating individual-level parameters and partworths within a likelihood-based hierarchical Bayesian framework. The authors show that modeling eye movements as the outcome of forward-looking utility maximization improves out-of-sample predictions, enables researchers and practitioners to use shorter questionnaires, and allows better discrimination between attributes.",1
"Attention, Information Processing, and Choice in Incentive-Aligned Choice Experiments",Journal of Marketing Research,2018,"In incentive-aligned choice experiments, each decision is realized with some probability, Prob. In three eye-tracking experiments, we study the impact of varying Prob from 0 (as in purely hypothetical choices) to 1 (as in real-life choices) on attention, information processing, and choice. Consistent with the bounded rationality literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers process the choice-relevant information more carefully and more comprehensively. Consistent with the psychological distance literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers become less novelty seeking and more price sensitive. These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference estimates as well.",1
"The Interface of International Marketing and Entrepreneurship Research: Review, Synthesis, and Future Directions",Journal of International Marketing,2018,"There is no intensive review available of research at the interface of international marketing and entrepreneurship. This article systematically logs and organizes the subject matter and provides research suggestions. An organizing framework with three main dimensions?international marketing, the nature of marketing, and entrepreneurship?guides the literature review, which relies on a full search of articles relevant to international marketing and entrepreneurship published in academic journals over the past two decades (1997?2016). The study adopts a qualitative research approach to analyze 169 articles that meet the definitions of both international marketing and entrepreneurship research. Nine research types emerge at the intersection of international marketing and entrepreneurship research, and the study examines the theoretical and empirical trends of each type. A promising avenue for future studies would be cross-cultural comparative research on the individual?opportunity nexus in marketing across countries. More mixed-method and longitudinal research designs are also welcomed. The authors conclude by offering suggestions for future interdisciplinary research.",0
Modeling Interdependent Consumer Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2003,"A consumer's preference for an offering can be influenced by the preferences of others in many ways, ranging from social identification and inclusion to the benefits of network externalities. In this article, the authors introduce a Bayesian spatial autoregressive discrete-choice model to study the preference interdependence among individual consumers. The autoregressive specification can reflect patterns of heterogeneity in which influence propagates within and across networks. These patterns cannot be modeled with standard random-effect specifications and can be difficult to capture with covariates in a linear model. The authors illustrate their model of interdependent preferences with data on automobile purchases and show that preferences for Japanese-made cars are related to geographically and demographically defined networks.",1
More Evidence Challenging the Robustness and Usefulness of the Attraction Effect,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Ninety-one attempts to produce an attraction effect (involving a total of 23 product classes and 73 different decoyed choice sets) produced only 11 reliable effects?significantly fewer than expected given the statistical power of the studies. Cross-scenario analyses indicated that the use of meaningful qualitative-verbal descriptions, as well as pictorial depictions, to differentiate choice options substantially reduced the size of those effects. Indeed, the authors found attraction effects at only chance levels using these types of stimuli. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of these findings for both marketing practice and research.",1
Modeling the Intrahousehold Behavioral Interaction,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"Quantitative models in marketing typically focus on the household as the unit of analysis while ignoring the individual family members' behavior and the behavioral interactions among household members. However, knowledge of such intrahousehold behavioral interaction enables marketers to target their communications more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a modeling framework to capture the intrahousehold behavioral interaction based on family members' actual consumption behavior over time. The authors develop a model to capture multiple agents' (more than two individuals') simultaneous choice decisions over more than two choice alternatives. This is extremely difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members' television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are watching. The proposed model makes it possible to estimate the individual's intrinsic preference and the extrinsic preference from a joint consumption with other members. In turn, these estimates enable the authors to test several alternative group decision-making heuristics that may operate in those joint consumption occasions and to conduct managerially useful counterfactual simulations.",1
"It's Not Whether you Win or Lose, It's how you Play the Game? the Role of Process and Outcome in Experience Consumption",Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Many firms attempt to enhance experience consumption by facilitating the consumption outcome (i.e., the end state achieved, such as the final score of a basketball game) and the consumption process (i.e., the course through which the end is achieved, such as how the game is played). The authors propose that the roles of outcome and process in the evaluation of experience consumption are dependent not only on consumers? role in the experience (participant vs. spectator) but also on their self-construal (independent vs. interdependent). As a spectator (e.g., watching a game), independents? (vs. interdependents') experience consumption evaluations are more likely to be influenced by outcome, while interdependent (vs. independent) consumers are more likely to be affected by process. The reverse is true when consumers assume the role of a participant in the experience (e.g., playing a game). The authors? theorizing is supported across three studies.",1
Banning Controversial Sponsors: Understanding Equilibrium Outcomes When Sports Sponsorships Are Viewed as Two-Sided Matches,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This article applies a two-sided matching model to investigate the consequences of banning controversial sponsors. Using a data set containing the shirt sponsorships from 43 English football clubs between 1990 and 2010, the authors' estimates suggest assortative matching between a club's attendance and a sponsor's revenue. In addition, sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors. Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors. Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be most affected by a ban. More generally, the results demonstrate that when marketing relationships are viewed as the result of a matching process, actions that affect only some marketers may have substantial indirect effects on a variety of players in the market.",1
Framing Influences Willingness to Pay but Not Willingness to Accept,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"The authors show, with real and hypothetical payoffs, that consumers are willing to pay substantially less for a risky prospect when it is called a ?lottery ticket,? ?raffle,? ?coin flip,? or ?gamble? than when it is labeled a ?gift certificate? or ?voucher.? Willingness to accept, in contrast, is not affected by these frames. This differential framing effect is the result of an aversion to bad deals, which causes buyers to focus on different aspects than sellers. Buyers? willingness to pay is influenced by the extent to which a risky prospect's frame is associated with risk (Experiment 1) as well as the prospect's lowest (but not highest) possible outcome (Experiment 2). Sellers? willingness to accept, in contrast, is influenced by a prospect's lowest and highest possible outcomes but not by the risk associated with its frame (Experiments 2 and 3). The framing effect on willingness to pay is independent of the objective level of uncertainty (Experiment 4) and can lead to the uncertainty effect. The findings have important implications for research on risk preferences and marketing practice.",1
Dealing with Institutional Distances in International Marketing Channels: Governance Strategies that Engender Legitimacy and Efficiency,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Firms doing business in foreign institutional environments face pressures to gain social acceptance (commonly referred to as legitimacy) and difficulty in evaluating market information, both of which undercut firm performance. In this article, the authors argue that firms can design governance strategies to deal with foreign institutions to secure both social acceptance and firm performance. Using a Chinese sample of manufacturers that export products to various foreign markets through local distributors, the authors develop and test a model that bridges the effects of institutional environments and governance strategy on channel performance. Specifically, they find that firms can use two governance strategies, contract customization and relational governance, to deal with both legitimacy and efficiency issues and to safeguard channel performance. Thus, international channel managers are advised to maintain an integrated management of legitimacy and efficiency in foreign marketing channels.",0
How Does Consumers? Local or Global Identity Influence Price?Perceived Quality Associations? The Role of Perceived Quality Variance,Journal of Marketing,2019,"Globalization has substantially influenced the world economy. However, managers have a limited understanding of how local?global identity influences consumers? price perceptions and behavior. In this research, the authors propose that consumers? local (vs. global) identity leads to a greater tendency to make price?perceived quality (PPQ) associations. Perceived quality variance among comparison brands is a key mechanism underlying these effects. Two field studies (Studies 1 and 7), seven experiments (Studies 2?6, 9, and 10), and a systematic review of secondary data (Study 8) provide converging and robust evidence for the effect of local?global identity on PPQ. Consistent with the perceived quality variance account, when quality differences among the brands are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in global (but not local) identity significantly increase, compared with baseline conditions. However, when perceived quality similarities are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in local (but not global) identity significantly decrease. Product type and distribution of customer ratings represent natural boundaries for the relationship between local?global identity and PPQ. The authors conclude with the implications for managers? targeting endeavors. We also provide specific tools that marketers can use in ads and point-of-purchase materials to encourage or discourage consumers in making PPQ associations.",0
Determining Consumers? Discount Rates with Field Studies,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%.",1
TV Channel Search and Commercial Breaks,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This study investigates time lapses that interrupt product consumption. Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers? search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products, they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese TV market, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi-natural experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV channels? viewership, offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks.",1
Sources and Management of Conflict: The Case of Saudi-U.S. Joint Ventures,Journal of International Marketing,1994,"Joint ventures predominate in business formats used by multinational corporations in developing countries. It is believed that joint ventures in these countries suffer more conflicts and performance problems than joint ventures in developed countries. However, there is little empirical research into understanding the nature of joint venture problems in less developed countries. Furthermore, what little research exists examines the issue from the perspective of the parent company at the expense of the local partner's point of view. The study reported here is intended to fill this void. Specifically, the study examines severity of various conflicts in Saudi-U.S. joint ventures operating in Saudi Arabia from the perspective of Saudi partners. Three critical sources of conflict are identified and analyzed in detail. The discussion concludes by recommending a dynamic approach to conflict management with a special emphasis on developing communication capabilities.",0
Strategic Change Implementation and Performance Loss in the Front Lines,Journal of Marketing,2007,"Adopting a frontline employee (FLE) perspective, this study models a performance loss process during an organization's strategic change implementation. The process is activated by changes in unit management's emphases on cost containment and revenue-generating strategies and is governed by FLE detachment. The authors also examine an intervention mechanism for mitigating performance loss by including the influence of FLE participation in change decisions. The model is tested with data from five service organizations that employ 843 FLEs. The results indicate that (1) FLE detachment is effective in separating out the negative and positive effects of change, (2) FLE change perceptions are sensitive to the focus of strategic change (cost containment versus revenue enhancement strategies), and (3) FLE participation significantly enhances the positive effects of change and mitigates performance loss.",0
Information Acquisition Activities: A Study of Global Start-Up Exporting Companies,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"In this study, the author investigates the antecedents of information search effort and information source use and the implications of firms? information acquisition activities on export performance. The author examines four major sets of variables to understand their impact on firms? information search effort and the use of personal, quasi-government, and documented sources. These variables are information source characteristics, firm strategic orientation, environmental characteristics, and organizational characteristics. Empirical results based on a survey of U.S. exporting firms provide mixed support for these factors in predicting firms? information search effort and information source use. Findings on firm performance support the notion that firms that engage in greater information search and those that rely on personal and quasi-government information sources tend to have higher performance levels.",0
Does Loving a Brand Mean Loving Its Products? the Role of Brand-Elicited Affect in Brand Extension Evaluations,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Three studies examine the influence of brand-elicited affect on consumers' evaluations of brand extensions. When a brand spontaneously elicits affective reactions, consumers appear to form an initial impression of the brand's new extension based on these reactions. The affect that they experience for other reasons and attribute to the brand can influence this impression as well. Their later evaluations of the extension are then based on this impression. This is true regardless of the similarity between the extension and the core brand. These results contrast with evidence that affect influences brand extension evaluations through its mediating impact on perceptions of core-extension similarity. This latter influence occurs only when consumers are explicitly asked to estimate the extension's similarity to the core before they evaluate it.",1
Do Customers and Employees Enjoy Service Participation? Synergistic Effects of Self- and Other-Efficacy,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Extant research confirms the importance of value cocreation through customer participation (CP), but relatively little is known about whether and how it creates an enjoyable experience for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience. This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client?financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants? satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.",0
Strengthening Customer Loyalty through Intimacy and Passion: Roles of Customer?Firm Affection and Customer?Staff Relationships in Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"This study extends the existing satisfaction?trust?loyalty paradigm to investigate how customers? affectionate ties with firms (customer?firm affection)?in particular, the components of intimacy and passion?affect customer loyalty in services. In a bilevel model, the authors consider customer?staff and customer?firm interactions in parallel. Through a netnography study and survey research in two service contexts, they confirm (1) the salience of intimacy and passion as two underrecognized components of customer?firm affection that influence customer loyalty, (2) the complementary and mediating role of customer?firm affection in strengthening customer loyalty, (3) significant affect transfers from the customer?staff to the customer?firm level, and (4) the dilemma that emerges when customer?staff relationships are too close. The findings provide several implications for researchers and managers regarding how intimacy and passion can enrich customer service interactions and how to manage customer?staff relationships properly.",1
"Coins Are Cold and Cards Are Caring: The Effect of Pregiving Incentives on Charity Perceptions, Relationship Norms, and Donation Behavior",Journal of Marketing,2020,"Charities often include low-value monetary (e.g., coins) and nonmonetary (e.g., greeting cards) pregiving incentives (PGIs) in their donation request letters. Yet little is known about how donors respond to this marketing strategy. In seven studies, including two large-scale field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of PGIs depends on the organization?s goals. People are more likely to open and read a letter containing a monetary PGI (vs. a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI). In addition, monetary PGIs increase response rates in donor acquisition campaigns. However, the return on investment for direct mail campaigns drops significantly when PGIs are included. Furthermore, average donations for appeals with a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI are similar, while those with a monetary PGI are actually lower than when a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI is included. This is because monetary PGIs increase exchange norms while decreasing communal norms. This effect remains significant when accounting for alternative explanations such as manipulative intent and the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.",0
Keep Your Cool or Let it Out: Nonlinear Effects of Expressed Arousal on Perceptions of Consumer Reviews,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"This research explores how expressed emotional arousal in a consumer review affects reader perceptions of its helpfulness. Drawing from research on written communication and lay theories of emotion, the authors propose a pattern of diminishing returns, in which the marginal effect of arousal on perceived helpfulness is positive at low levels of arousal but diminishes at higher levels. Results of a field study using Apple's App Store, a follow-up survey, and two laboratory experiments provide consistent evidence for the predicted pattern. In addition, the results suggest that the nonlinear effect is explained in part by perceptions of reviewer effort and that the effect is stronger for products that are utilitarian in nature. By revealing a nuanced relationship between emotional expression and perceived helpfulness, these findings offer valuable implications for effective word-of-mouth communication.",1
Leveraging Missing Ratings to Improve Online Recommendation Systems,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"?Product recommendation systems? are backbones of the Internet economy, leveraging customers' prior product ratings to generate subsequent suggestions. A key feature of recommendation data is that few customers rate more than a handful of items. Extant models take missing recommendation rating data to be missing completely at random, implicitly presuming that they lack meaningful patterns or utility in improving ratings accuracy. For the widely studied EachMovie data, the authors find that missing data are strongly nonignorable. Recommendation quality is improved substantially by jointly modeling ?selection? and ?ratings,? both whether and how an item is rated. Accounting for missing ratings and various sources of heterogeneity offers a rich portrait of which items are rated well, which are rated at all, and how these processes are intertwined, while reducing holdout error by 10% or more. The authors discuss ways to implement the proposed framework within existing recommendation systems and its implications for marketers.",1
The Role of the Internationalization Process in the Performance of Newly Internationalizing Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2000,"A study of 68 recently internationalized U.S. firms, using structural equations, shows that newly internationalizing firms do not on average follow a highly systematic approach. Some firms make use of a systematic sequence of steps, and the more systematic the approach, the better is the performance.",0
How Customer Portfolio Affects New Product Development in Technology-Based Entrepreneurial Firms,Journal of Marketing,2008,"This article focuses on how the customer portfolios of technology-based entrepreneurial firms affect new product development. Drawing on knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the new product development literature, helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms. The results also contribute to the broader discourse on how customers affect new product development.",0
Identifying the Presence and Cause of Fashion Cycles in Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Fashions and conspicuous consumption play an important role in marketing. In this article, the author presents a three-pronged framework to analyze fashion cycles in data composed of (1) algorithmic methods for identifying cycles, (2) a statistical framework for identifying cycles, and (3) methods for examining the drivers of such cycles. In the first module, the author identifies cycles by pattern-matching the amplitude and length of cycles observed to a user-specified definition. In the second module, the author defines the conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third, the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the different theories of fashion. The author applies her framework to data on given names for infants, shows the presence of large-amplitude cycles both algorithmically and statistically, and confirms that the adoption patterns are consistent with Bourdieu's theory of fashion as a signal of cultural capital.",1
Keeping the American Dream Alive: The Interactive Effect of Perceived Economic Mobility and Materialism on Impulsive Spending,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"This research illustrates how perceived economic mobility moderates the linkage between materialism and impulsive spending. Using various data sources, four studies show that materialistic consumers do not easily engage in impulsive spending when they perceive high economic mobility, whereas they tend to spend impulsively when they perceive low economic mobility. However, perceived economic mobility functions in the opposite manner when the purchase is a means to achieve financial success. The authors trace this effect to the self-regulation process of materialistic consumers, such that when perceiving high economic mobility, these consumers regulate their behavior toward long-term financial success, sacrificing the pleasure of acquisitions in the present. By elucidating the important role that perceived economic mobility plays in impulsive spending, the current research sheds new light on consumer research and offers managerial and public policy implications.",1
The Malleable Brand: The Role of Implicit Theories in Evaluating Brand Extensions,Journal of Marketing,2010,"This research documents how implicit theories regarding personality traits (whether they are deemed to be fixed or malleable) affect consumer inferences about the malleability of a brand's personality traits and, thus, its ability to extend into new categories. Study 1 documents that consumers who believe that traits are malleable (incremental theorists) are more accepting of brand extensions than consumers who believe that traits are fixed (entity theorists). These results hold whether implicit theories are measured or manipulated. Study 2 reveals how implicit theories affect consumers? perceptions regarding the flexibility of a brand's personality traits and not its physical traits. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers primed with different implicit theory orientations respond differently to varying degrees of change within a single trait. This study tests the limits of the effect and demonstrates the impact of using primes embedded within standard marketing communication.",0
A Meta-Analysis of Electronic Word-of-Mouth Elasticity,Journal of Marketing,2015,"The authors conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of electronic word of mouth on sales by examining 51 studies (involving 339 volume and 271 valence elasticities) and primary data collected on product characteristics (durability, trialability, and usage condition), industry characteristics (industry growth and competition), and platform characteristics (expertise and trustworthiness). Their analysis reveals that electronic word-of-mouth volume (valence) elasticity is .236 (.417). More importantly, the findings show that volume and valence elasticities are higher for privately consumed, low-trialability products that operate in less competitive industries and whose reviews are carried on independent review sites. Furthermore, volume elasticities are higher for durable goods and for reviews on specialized review sites, whereas valence elasticities are greater for community-based sites. Drawing on the results, they discuss several implications for managers and researchers and explain why valence elasticities are often found to be insignificant. Finally, they propose numerous directions for future research in the area on the basis of their findings.",0
When and Why Saying ?Thank You? Is Better Than Saying ?Sorry? in Redressing Service Failures: The Role of Self-Esteem,Journal of Marketing,2019,"In their initial recovery efforts after a service failure, service providers need to decide what to communicate to consumers to restore their satisfaction. Prior work has primarily examined apology (saying ?sorry?) as a symbolic recovery strategy; the current research suggests appreciation (saying ?thank you?) as an alternative, often more effective strategy. Drawing from research on linguistic framing and self-view, the authors reason that the shift of focus in the service provider?consumer interaction, from emphasizing service providers? fault and accountability (apology) to spotlighting consumers? merits and contributions (appreciation), can increase consumers? self-esteem and, in turn, postrecovery satisfaction. Across multiple service failure contexts, Studies 1a?1e establish the superiority of appreciation in redressing service failures. By measuring and manipulating self-esteem and examining the moderating role of narcissism and recovery timing, Studies 2?5 provide converging evidence for consumers? state self-esteem as the underlying mechanism. Studies 6 and 7 go beyond examining appreciation in isolation and show that it is as effective as recovery messages that combine appreciation and apology (Study 6) and that its superiority over apology holds when service providers combine symbolic and utilitarian recovery (Study 7).",0
The Effects of Consumers? Price Expectations on Sellers? Dynamic Pricing Strategies,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors propose a dynamic market equilibrium model to investigate how consumers form price expectations and how these expectations influence their sequential search behavior and prices in the market. They derive a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium and show that whereas higher current period prices induce search, consumers who observe higher historical prices form higher price expectations, become more pessimistic, and search less. Furthermore, the authors show that when prices increase as a result of an increase in marginal costs, consumers respond by searching more, which then leads to higher prices and instant price adjustment. In contrast, because consumer search activities decline when prices fall, sellers may respond by lowering their prices just enough to dampen consumers? search tendencies when costs decrease. The authors test their theoretical model and its implications and find support for it in a series of simulated market experiments.",1
How and When Does Customer Orientation Influence Frontline Employee Job Outcomes? A Meta-Analytic Evaluation,Journal of Marketing,2012,"Previous research has conceptualized and modeled customer orientation (CO) in one of two ways: as a psychological phenomenon antecedent to critical job states (i.e., stress and engagement) or as frontline employee behaviors that are caused by these same job states. Building on meta-analytic data, this study finds greater support for the causal relationships implied by a psychological construal of the construct and reveals that CO influences frontline employees' job outcomes through its effects on stress and engagement. Moderation analyses also indicate that CO's influence on model variables is stronger when frontline employees' customer workloads increase and is weaker as the need for customer persuasion increases. These findings contradict widely held assumptions rooted in a behavioral view of CO?namely, that CO is a consequence of job states, a proximate determinant of job outcomes, and most beneficial when ample opportunity for customer engagement exists. Overall, the results support a broadened perspective that recognizes that CO improves job outcomes because it enhances frontline employees' psychological welfare in addition to being good for business. These findings suggest that managers should consider CO an important criterion in frontline employee decisions, recognize CO as beneficial when limited opportunity for customer engagement exists, and avoid efforts to curtail CO's costs at the frontline employee level.",0
Discounting Time and Time Discounting: Subjective Time Perception and Intertemporal Preferences,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Consumers often make decisions about outcomes and events that occur over time. This research examines consumers' sensitivity to the prospective duration relevant to their decisions and the implications of such sensitivity for intertemporal trade-offs, especially the degree of present bias (i.e., hyperbolic discounting). The authors show that participants' subjective perceptions of prospective duration are not sufficiently sensitive to changes in objective duration and are nonlinear and concave in objective time, consistent with psychophysical principles. More important, this lack of sensitivity can explain hyperbolic discounting. The results replicate standard hyperbolic discounting effects with respect to objective time but show a relatively constant rate of discounting with respect to subjective time perceptions. The results are replicated between subjects (Experiment 1) and within subjects (Experiments 2), with multiple time horizons and multiple descriptors, and with different measurement orders. Furthermore, the authors show that when duration is primed, subjective time perception is altered (Experiment 4) and hyperbolic discounting is reduced (Experiment 3).",1
A Theories-in-Use Approach to Building Marketing Theory,Journal of Marketing,2019,"This article?s objective is to inspire and provide guidance on the development of marketing knowledge based on the theories-in-use (TIU) approach. The authors begin with a description of the TIU approach and compare it with other inductive and deductive research approaches. The benefits of engaging in TIU-based research are discussed, including the development of novel organic marketing theories and the opportunity to cocreate relevant marketing knowledge with practitioners. Next, they review criteria for selecting research questions that are particularly well-suited for examination with TIU-based research. This is followed by detailed suggestions for TIU research: focusing on developing new constructs, theoretical propositions (involving antecedents, moderators, and consequences), and arguments for justifying theoretical propositions. A discussion of TIU tradecraft skills, validity checks, and limitations follows. The authors close with a discussion of future theory-building opportunities using the TIU approach.",0
Forward-Looking Bidding in Online Auctions,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"At Internet auction sites, such as eBay, nearly identical goods are often sold in a sequence of auctions, separated by small amounts of time. Upcoming auctions are announced several days in advance, so buyers can benefit from forward-looking strategies that take this information into account. This article develops a model of such bidding, provides empirical evidence of the model's relevance to actual behavior on eBay, and discusses the general implications of forward-looking bidding for sequential, auction-driven marketplaces.",1
The Hesitant Hai Gui: Return-Migration Preferences of U.S.-Educated Chinese Scientists and Engineers,Journal of Marketing Research,2013,"Managers, research administrators, and policy makers need a greater understanding of the factors that drive employment preferences of foreign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral graduates of U.S. universities. To address this need, the authors report the results of a large multischool conjoint survey of return-migration preferences among U.S. STEM doctoral students from China. The survey presents the respondents with potential job offers and yields individual-level estimates of each respondent's indirect utility of a job as a function of location, job status, and salary. The authors use a delayed follow-up choice task to demonstrate stability of the preference estimates both over time and across response modalities. The estimated preferences imply that Chinese doctoral graduates tend to remain in the United States because of a large salary disparity between the two countries rather than because of an inherent preference for locating in the United States. Given these estimated preferences, the authors conduct several policy-relevant, counterfactual simulations of return-migration choice and outline effective targeting and positioning strategy for attracting Chinese STEM talent.",1
Statistical Benefits of Choices from Subsets,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Marketers often analyze multinomial choice from a set of branded products to learn about demand. Given a set of brands to study, the authors analyze three reasons why choices from strict subsets of the brands can contain more statistical information about demand than choices from all the brands in the study: First, making choices from smaller subsets is easier, so it is possible to use more choice tasks when the choice data come from a choice-based conjoint survey. Second, choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand shares when some of the brands are less popular than others. The authors demonstrate these three benefits of subsets using a mixture of analytical results and numerical simulations and provide implications for the design of choice-based conjoint analyses. They find that the optimal subset size depends on the model, the number of brands in the study and the designer's resource constraint. In addition to showing that subsets can be beneficial, this article provides a simulation methodology that helps designers pick the best subset size for their setting.",1
The ?Response-to-Failure? Scale: Predicting Behavior following Initial Self-Control Failure,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Whereas most existing self-control research and scales focus on singular self-control choice, the current work examines sequential self-control behavior. Specifically, this research focuses on behavior following initial self-control failure, identifying a set of key cognitive and emotional responses to initial failure that jointly underlie post-failure behavior. The tendency to experience these responses is captured in a new scale, the Response-to-Failure scale, which the authors develop and test in three consumer domains: eating, spending, and cheating. The results support the use of the same emotional and cognitive factors to predict post-failure behavior across these three domains, providing evidence of the generalizability of the scale structure. The data support the scale's structure, nomological and discriminant validity, and test?retest reliability across five studies. In five additional studies, the scale's predictive validity is demonstrated beyond other existing relevant scales. The authors also develop and test a short form of each domain scale. Finally, the authors discuss the implications for understanding post-failure behavior and suggest practical uses for the scale.",1
"If at First You Do Succeed, Do You Try, Try Again? Developing the Persistence?Licensing Response Measure to Understand, Predict, and Modify Behavior Following Subgoal Success",Journal of Marketing Research,2019,"Following subgoal success at a long-term goal, consumers can persist, behaving consistently with the long-term goal, or license, behaving consistently with competing shorter-term goals. The authors extend prior work by proposing that this choice is driven, in part, by chronic differences in consumers? cognitive and emotional responses to subgoal success. In Studies 1?5, they develop and validate a measure that captures these individual differences: the Persistence?Licensing Response Measure (PLRM). They demonstrate that the PLRM predicts persistence and licensing where existing constructs and measures do not, showing that consumers? responses to subgoal success represent a unique dimension of self-regulation. In Studies 6?10, the authors demonstrate that the PLRM moderates the effect of subgoal success on persistence and licensing behavior, revealing that the same subgoal success situation can lead to systematically different behaviors. The authors also examine how marketing interventions can be used to increase consumers? persistence following subgoal success. This work furthers the understanding of the determinants of persistence and licensing, improves prediction of behavior, and offers marketers tools to segment and target consumers, increasing persistence in key goal domains.",1
Sustainable Export Marketing Strategy Fit and Performance,Journal of International Marketing,2014,"Despite the growing global importance of sustainability issues, scant research has examined marketing strategy sustainability issues in international settings. Although significant prior work has examined drivers and performance consequences of adaptation/standardization of marketing strategies in international markets, researchers have yet to apply this avenue of inquiry to sustainable marketing strategies. Building on contingency theory and the concept of strategic fit, the authors develop a model of drivers of sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation and explore the circumstances under which such a strategy affects export performance. Using a sample of U.K. exporters, they find that various macro- and microenvironmental factors are responsible for sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation, which shapes the nature of sustainable export marketing strategy fit and its export venture performance outcomes. The results indicate that sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation is the outcome of the differences between home and export markets in terms of economic and technological conditions, competitive intensity, customer characteristics, and stakeholder pressures. Moreover, the performance relevance of sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation requires adequate fit with these macro- and microenvironmental factors.",0
The Rise of the Sharing Economy: Estimating the Impact of Airbnb on the Hotel Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Peer-to-peer markets, collectively known as the sharing economy, have emerged as alternative suppliers of goods and services traditionally provided by long-established industries. The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8%?10% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms?enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.",1
Expanding to the Internet: Pricing and Communications Strategies When Firms Compete on Multiple Channels,Journal of Marketing Research,2000,"The author shows how firms' pricing and communications strategies may be affected by the size of the Internet: Firms have incentives to facilitate consumer search on the Internet, but only as long as the Internet's reach is limited. As the Internet is used by more consumers, firms' pricing and communications strategies on the Internet will mirror the strategies they pursue in a conventional channel. Firms can increase their market power by strategically using information on multiple channels to achieve finer consumer segmentation. The author suggests directions the Internet might take and derives managerial implications. The findings generalize to other channels that enable firms to segment consumers and inform them at low cost.",1
How the Internet Lowers Prices: Evidence from Matched Survey and Automobile Transaction Data,Journal of Marketing Research,2006,"Although research has shown that the Internet has lowered the prices in some established industries, little is known about how use of the Internet lowers prices. The authors address this issue for the automobile retailing industry with matched survey and transaction data on 1500 car purchases in California. They show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons: First, the Internet informs consumers about dealers' invoice prices. Second, the referral process of online buying services helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined information and referral price effects are ?1.5%, or 22% of dealers' average gross vehicle profit. The authors also find that the benefits of gathering information differ by consumer type. Buyers who have a high disutility of bargaining but who have collected information on the specific car they eventually purchase pay 1.5% less than they otherwise would. In contrast, buyers who like the bargaining process do not benefit from such information.",1
"Consumer Ethnocentrism, National Identity, and Consumer Cosmopolitanism as Drivers of Consumer Behavior: A Social Identity Theory Perspective",Journal of International Marketing,2015,"Consumers? preferences for domestic over imported products have been investigated in various isolated studies, but never in a single model incorporating several in-group and out-group consumer orientations at the same time. Building on social identity theory, this study develops and tests?in two countries?a conceptual model that assesses the relative influence of consumer ethnocentrism, national identity, and consumer cosmopolitanism on consumers? product judgments and willingness to buy domestic and foreign products. Furthermore, the study develops an empirically based typology of consumer segments using these sociopsychological traits and subsequently profiles them on consumption-relevant variables. The findings reveal several undiscovered patterns regarding the interplay of consumer ethnocentrism, national identity, and consumer cosmopolitanism as drivers of consumer behavior and offer managerial guidance on their relevance as segmentation variables.",0
The Litigated Dissolution of International Distribution Relationships: A Process Framework and Propositions,Journal of International Marketing,2006,"The litigated dissolution of international distribution relationships severely hampers exchange partners? international efforts. Although relationship dissolution through litigation is a central issue in international business, limited research has been conducted to understand this process, thus leaving academics and practitioners with an incomplete theoretical or practitioner understanding of issues involved in this process. This study uses a systematic analysis of legal cases over the 1985?2005 period to better understand this issue from a longitudinal perspective. Using legal case data, the authors develop a process framework, which includes formalized propositions, to denote two separate litigation dissolution processes: proactive and reactive. The legal case analysis indicates that the two types of relationship dissolution processes have unique triggers and outcomes, which suggests differences in theoretical models and managerial actions. The authors present academic and practitioner implications.",0
Intra- and Interfirm Coordination of Export Manufacturers: A Cluster Analysis of Indigenous Chinese Exporters,Journal of International Marketing,2008,"Export manufacturers face challenges associated with intrafirm coordination among functional units and interfirm coordination with foreign distributors. The majority of research on export coordination examines intra- and interfirm coordination strategies separately. Consequently, limited insights have been gained into how export manufacturers combine the various intra- and interfirm coordination strategies to achieve export success. Using a cluster analysis, the authors incorporate both intra- and interfirm coordination strategies as inputs to identify profiles of export manufacturers. They identify four distinct profiles: balanced coordinators, interactive coordinators, flexibility-only coordinators, and unfocused coordinators. The authors find that the best performers are balanced coordinators, or the export manufacturers that concurrently deploy multiple intra- and interfirm coordination strategies.",0
Nonlinear Effects of Social Connections and Interactions on Individual Goal Attainment and Spending: Evidences from Online Gaming Markets,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Although it seems intuitive for firms to leverage social connections and interactions to influence consumers? goal attainment and spending, the authors present a caveat of such strategies. Using two large-scale data sets with more than 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Studies 1 and 2 show consistently nonlinear effects. Although some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too many of them have a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques addressing self-selection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. In addition, novices can benefit more from greater social connections and interactions, yet also suffer more from the diminishing effects. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 shows that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too many of them can introduce an information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.",0
Competitive Action in the Diffusion of Internet Technology Products in Emerging Markets: Implications for Global Marketing Managers,Journal of International Marketing,2011,"This research explores the extent to which competitive actions of multinational corporations (MNCs) and local vendors of Internet technology products shape the diffusion of their respective products in emerging markets. Drawing on competitive technology diffusion, the Austrian perspective on firms? market processes, and resource advantage theory, the authors develop a set of hypotheses regarding the characteristics of the competitive actions of MNCs and local vendors. They validate the hypotheses with longitudinal field data from two pairs of competing Internet technology products in search engine and consumer-to-consumer electronic markets. The findings indicate that specific market-oriented actions of local vendors and MNCs influence the diffusion of technology products. In particular, global marketing managers should concentrate on a few key actions and take new actions that differ from those of local vendors in emerging markets. This study provides a wealth of knowledge in high-technology product diffusion and demonstrates how competition between local vendors and MNCs in emerging markets differs from typical within-industry competition. In addition, this study conveys important implications to the theory of international business.",0
"Managing Knowledge for Innovation: The Role of Cooperation, Competition, and Alliance Nationality",Journal of International Marketing,2010,"Strategic alliances play a critical role in global innovation. Firms can overcome resource constraints and achieve superior innovative performance not only by using internal resources but also by acquiring knowledge-based capabilities from alliance partners. In this study, the authors investigate how knowledge acquired from alliance partners affects organizational knowledge creation, which in turn leads to innovative performance. The authors propose that the knowledge?innovation relationship is stronger in international alliances than domestic alliances. The results from a survey of 127 German firms engaged in strategic alliances confirm that knowledge creation mediates the effect of knowledge acquisition on innovative performance and that international alliances strengthen the effect of knowledge creation on innovative performance. In addition, the authors find that interfirm cooperation and competition coexist in strategic alliances and that both factors increase knowledge acquisition, though from different motivational bases.",0
The Impact of an Item-Based Loyalty Program on Consumer Purchase Behavior,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"The authors conduct an empirical investigation of a new retail loyalty program (LP), called an item-based loyalty program (IBLP), in which price discounts are replaced by reward point promotions that need to be accumulated and redeemed later. The main objective is to examine its impact on various aspects of consumer purchase behavior and a retailer's sales revenue. They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new LP had a significantly different impact on ?current? LP members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers. Finally, the IBLP reduced attrition among existing customers and attracted more new customers, which contributed to most of the retailer's sales revenue gain after adopting the IBLP.",1
"Product Development Strategy, Product Innovation Performance, and the Mediating Role of Knowledge Utilization: Evidence from Subsidiaries in China",Journal of International Marketing,2009,"This study examines the interplay of product development strategy, knowledge utilization, and product innovation performance in the context of Chinese subsidiaries of multinational companies. When firms strive to develop highly innovative products (breakthrough focus), the amount of resources allocated has a U-shaped relationship to subsequent product innovation performance (i.e., market rewards of new products). When the aim of product development activity is to reinforce and maintain moderately innovative products (platform focus), increased resource allocation shows a positive relationship to product innovation performance. The amount of resources allocated to minor revisions (incremental focus) shows no significant relationship to product innovation performance. Knowledge utilization is an important predictor of the benefits of developing highly and moderately innovative products. Moreover, it helps to mitigate the drawbacks of a breakthrough focus and strengthens the positive impact of a platform focus.",0
Brand-Level Effects of Stockkeeping Unit Reductions,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"When retailers make product assortment changes by eliminating certain stockkeeping units (SKUs), how does this affect sales of individual brands? This is the main question the authors address in this article. Using data from an online retailer that implemented a permanent systemwide SKU reduction (SR) program, the authors investigate how the program affected various components of purchase behavior for individual brands. They find substantial variations in the SR effects across brands, categories, and consumers. They explore possible drivers for these differences and find that higher-market-share, higher-priced, and more frequently promoted brands tend to gain share and that reduction in the number of sizes, reduction in the number of SKUs, and change in SKU share in the category are important in affecting change in a brand's purchase share after the SR. They also find that SRs lead to an increase in category purchase incidence and quantity for highly state-dependent consumers and frequent buyers but a decrease in category purchase and quantity for mildly state-dependent consumers and infrequent buyers. In addition, SRs tend to cause more changes in brand choice probabilities among consumers of lower state dependence and higher price and promotion sensitivity. These findings are of importance both to retailers wanting to make product assortment changes and to manufacturers affected by them.",1
The Effectiveness of Customized Promotions in Online and Offline Stores,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This study investigates the effectiveness of customized promotions at three levels of granularity (mass market, segment specific, and individual specific) in online and offline stores. The authors conduct an empirical examination of the profit potential of these customized promotion programs with a joint model of purchase incidence, choice, and quantity and through optimization procedures for approximately 300 conditions. They find that (1) optimization procedures lead to substantial profit improvements over the current practice for all types of promotions (customized and undifferentiated); (2) loyalty promotions are more profitable in online stores than in offline stores, while the opposite holds for competitive promotions; (3) the incremental payoff of individual-level over segment- and mass market?level customized promotions is small in general, especially in offline stores; (4) for categories that are promotion sensitive, individual-level customized promotions can lead to a meaningful profit increase over segment- and mass market?level customized promotions in online stores; and (5) low redemption rates are a major impediment to the success of customized promotions in offline stores. Optimal undifferentiated promotions should be the primary promotion program in this channel, and firms can benefit from offering a combination of optimal undifferentiated and customized promotions for suitable categories in offline stores.",1
Sales Effects of Attention to Feature Advertisements: A Bayesian Mediation Analysis,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"There is much evidence that the presence of a feature advertisement can increase the sales and market share of the featured product. However, little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color, and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions.",1
Dynamic Relationship Marketing,Journal of Marketing,2016,"Firms routinely engage in relationship marketing (RM) efforts to improve their relationships with business partners, and extant research has documented the effectiveness of various RM strategies. According to the perspective proposed in this article, as customers migrate through different relationship states over time, not all RM strategies are equally effective, so it is possible to identify the most effective RM strategies given customers? states. The authors apply a multivariate hidden Markov model to a six-year longitudinal data set of 552 business-to-business relationships maintained by a Fortune 500 firm. The analysis identifies four latent buyer?seller relationship states, according to each customer's level of commitment, trust, dependence, and relational norms, and it parsimoniously captures customers? migration across relationship states through three positive (exploration, endowment, recovery) and two negative (neglect, betrayal) migration mechanisms. The most effective RM strategies across migration paths can help firms promote customer migration to higher performance states and prevent deterioration to poorer ones. A counterfactual elasticity analysis compares the relative importance of different migration strategies at various relationship stages. This research thus moves beyond extant RM literature by focusing on the differential effectiveness of RM strategies across relationship states, and it provides managerial guidance regarding efficient, dynamic resource allocations.",0
Creating Local Brands in Multilingual International Markets,Journal of Marketing Research,2001,"Despite the importance of decisions regarding international brand names, research on brand naming has focused primarily on English name creation. The authors conceptualize the local brand-name creation process in a multilingual international market. The authors present a framework that incorporates (1) a linguistic analysis of three translation methods?phonetic (i.e., by sound), semantic (i.e., by meaning), and phonosemantic (i.e., by sound plus meaning)?and (2) a cognitive analysis focusing on the impact of primes and expectations on consumer name evaluations. Using dual English-and-Chinese brand names, the authors show that the effectiveness of the translation depends on the emphasis of the original English name (versus the Chinese name) and the method of translation used previously for brand names within the same category.",1
A Joint Examination of Quality Choice and Satisfaction: The Impact of Circumstantial Variables,Journal of Marketing Research,2014,"Using data from an online hotel reservation site, the authors jointly examine consumers? quality choice decision at the time of purchase and subsequent satisfaction with the hotel stay. They identify three circumstantial variables at the time of purchase that are likely to influence both the choice decisions and the postpurchase satisfaction: the time gap between purchase and consumption, distance between purchase and consumption, and time of purchase (business/nonbusiness hours). The authors incorporate these three circumstantial variables into a formal two-stage economic model and find that consumers who travel farther and make reservations during business hours are more likely to select higher-quality hotels but are less satisfied. Consumers who book earlier are more likely to select higher-quality hotels and are more satisfied. The findings suggest that incorporating circumstantial variables into formal choice models is useful in helping managers understand and predict consumer choices and satisfaction assessments.",1
Dynamically Managing a Profitable Email Marketing Program,Journal of Marketing Research,2017,"Although email marketing is highly profitable and widely used by marketers, it has received limited attention in the marketing literature. Extant research has focused on either customers? email responses or the ?average? effect of emails on purchases. In this article, the authors use data from a U.S. home improvement retailer to study customers? email open and purchase behaviors by using a unified hidden Markov and copula framework. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that email-active customers are not necessarily active in purchases, and vice versa. Furthermore, the number of emails sent by the retailer has a nonlinear effect on both the retailer's short- and long-term profitability. Through a counterfactual study, the authors provide a decision support system to guide retailers in making optimal email contact decisions. This study shows that sending the right number of emails is vital for long-term profitability. For example, sending four (ten) emails instead of the optimal number of seven emails can cause the retailer to lose 32% (16%) of its lifetime profit per customer.",1
An Examination of Social Influence on Shopper Behavior Using Video Tracking Data,Journal of Marketing,2014,"This research investigates how the social elements of a retail store visit affect shoppers? product interaction and purchase likelihood. The research uses a bivariate model of the shopping process, implemented in a hierarchical Bayes framework, which models the customer and contextual factors driving product touch and purchase simultaneously. A unique video tracking database captures each shopper's path and activities during the store visit. The findings reveal that interactive social influences (e.g., salesperson contact, shopper conversations) tend to slow the shopper down, encourage a longer store visit, and increase product interaction and purchase. When shoppers are part of a larger group, they are influenced more by discussions with companions and less by third parties. Stores with customers present encourage product interaction up to a point, beyond which the density of shoppers interferes with the shopping process. The effects of social influence vary by the salesperson's demographic similarity to the shopper and the type of product category being shopped. Several behavioral cues signal when shoppers are in a potentially high need state and may be good sales prospects.",0
Online Shopping and Social Media: Friends or Foes?,Journal of Marketing,2017,"As social network use continues to increase, an important question for marketers is whether consumers? online shopping activities are related to their use of social networks and, if so, what the nature of this relationship is. On the one hand, spending time on social networks could facilitate social discovery, meaning that consumers ?discover? or ?stumble upon? products through their connections with others. Moreover, cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, social network use could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between social network use and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people's browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year. The authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity. However, they also find a short-term negative relationship, such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites, online shopping activity appears to be lower.",0
Power Distance Belief and Impulsive Buying,Journal of Marketing Research,2010,"The authors propose that power distance belief (PDB) (i.e., accepting and expecting power disparity) influences impulsive buying beyond other related cultural dimensions, such as individualism?collectivism. This research supports an associative account that links PDB and impulsive buying as a manifestation of self-control, such that those with high PDB display less impulsive buying. Furthermore, this effect manifests for vice products but not for virtue products. The authors also find that restraint from temptations can occur automatically for people who have repeated practice (i.e., chronically high PDBs). Taken together, these results imply that products should be differentially positioned as vice or virtue products in accordance with consumers? PDBs.",1
The Impact of Regulatory Focus on Adolescents? Response to Antismoking Advertising Campaigns,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"The authors demonstrate that antismoking advertisements are the most persuasive when the viewers? regulatory focus, the message's regulatory focus, and the message frame function synergistically. In two experiments, 1000 adolescents saw either antismoking advertising about smoking's social consequences or control advertising in a television show. The authors find that for promotion-focused adolescents, a promotion-focused positively framed antismoking message is the most effective at persuading them not to smoke; for prevention-focused adolescents, a prevention-focused negatively framed antismoking message is the most effective. The enhanced ad effectiveness is mediated by message accessibility and diagnosticity.",1
The Impact of Industry Concentration and Firm Location on Export Propensity and Intensity: An Empirical Analysis of Chinese Manufacturing Firms,Journal of International Marketing,2002,"Recent export studies have focused on the internal/controllable determinants of export performance. The external/uncontrollable determinants of export performance have received scant research attention. In this study, the authors examine two key external/uncontrollable factors, namely, industry concentration and firm location, in the context of Chinese manufacturing firms. In addition, the authors include several frequently studied factors such as firm size, capital intensity, technology innovation, and industry in the analysis as covariates. On the basis of logistical regression and multiple regression analysis, the authors find that both domestic market concentration and firm location are potent predictors of Chinese firms? export propensity and export intensity. The authors discuss implications of the findings to expose the reason behind the success of Chinese exporters in international markets.",0
The Role of Imagination-Focused Visualization on New Product Evaluation,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"In this research, the authors examine the impact of imagination-focused visualization on the evaluation of really new products (RNPs)?that is, products that provide novel benefits but involve high learning costs. They compare imagination-focused visualization with memory-focused visualization and demonstrate that an imaginative focus leads to higher evaluations of an RNP but has no effect on the evaluation of incrementally new products, which involve continuous innovations that are easier to understand. They find that the underlying mechanism for this effect is imagination's impact on the perceived value of new benefits rather than on the learning costs. Furthermore, they show that the advantage of an imaginative focus is not simply due to the increased focus on product benefits, because imagination still leads to higher product evaluation than memory-focused visualization, even if participants in both conditions are asked to think about product benefits exclusively. Finally, an explicit focus on learning costs while using an imaginative approach draws attention away from product benefits and attenuates the advantage of imagination on product evaluation.",1
Mental Simulation and Preference Consistency over Time: The Role of Process- versus Outcome-Focused Thoughts,Journal of Marketing Research,2007,"Research on choice over time has found that people tend to focus on concrete aspects of near-future events and abstract aspects of distant-future events. Furthermore, a focus on concrete aspects heightens the feasibility-related components, whereas a focus on abstract aspects heightens the desirability-related components, which can lead to preference inconsistency over time. In this research, the authors integrate research on choice over time with mental simulation. They propose and show that counter to people's natural tendencies, outcome simulation for near-future events and process simulation for distant-future events lead to preference consistency over time. The results also suggest that outcome timing moderates the effectiveness of process versus outcome simulation.",1
Mental Simulation and Product Evaluation: The Affective and Cognitive Dimensions of Process versus Outcome Simulation,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"In this research, the authors examine the role of process versus outcome simulation in product evaluation and demonstrate how manipulating the type of information-processing mode (cognitive vs. affective) leads to unique effects in process and outcome simulation. The article begins with the premise that when consumers do not have well-formed preferences for a product, they tend to focus on the usage process. The authors predict and find that outcome simulation is more effective than process simulation in increasing product evaluation under a cognitive mode, whereas process simulation is more effective than outcome simulation under an affective mode. Establishing boundary conditions, the authors further show the effect of two important moderators that alter consumers' focus on/away from the product's usage process. Specifically, they show a reversal of the effect for each type of mental simulation for hedonic products, for which product benefits are the more salient aspect (vs. the usage process). Furthermore, a distant-future (vs. near-future) evaluation frame shifts people's focus away from the usage process toward product benefits and reverses the effect of each type of simulation. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.",1
Effects of Social and Temporal Distance on Consumers' Responses to Peer Recommendations,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"This article examines the interplay of social and temporal distance on consumers' responses to others' recommendations. Drawing on research on psychological distance and the ?fit? literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance. Research and managerial implications are discussed.",1
Consumer learning in a turbulent Market environment: Modeling Consumer Choice Dynamics after a Product-harm Crisis,Journal of Marketing Research,2011,"The authors empirically study consumer choice behavior in the wake of a product-harm crisis, which creates consumer uncertainty about product quality. They develop a model that explicitly incorporates the impact of such uncertainty on consumer behavior, assuming that consumers are uncertain about the mean product quality level and learn about product quality through the signals contained in use experience and the product-harm crisis and also that consumers are uncertain about the precision of the signals in conveying product quality and update their perception of this precision over time. They estimate this model using a scanner panel data set that includes consumer purchase history before, during, and after a product-harm crisis that affected Kraft Foods australia's peanut butter division in June 1996. The proposed model fits the data better than the standard consumer learning model, which assumes consumers are uncertain about product quality level but the precision of information in conveying product quality is known. This study also provides insights into consumers? behavioral choice responses to a product-harm crisis. Finally, the authors conduct counterfactual experiments based on the estimation results and provide insights to managers on crisis management.",1
Predicting New Customers' Risk Type in the Credit Card Market,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Recent studies in marketing have consistently shown that all customers are not equally profitable. In the credit card business, all customers are not equally risky. When a customer misses one payment on a credit card bill, a signal is sent to the credit card company. It is important for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different consumer types. This article develops a dynamic model for debt repayment behavior of new customers in the credit card market that makes it possible to differentiate between low-risk, delinquent customers and high-risk customers. The authors apply the model to a data set of new consumers' monthly spending and repayment records.",1
Effects of Contract Ambiguity in Interorganizational Governance,Journal of Marketing,2020,"This work introduces the concept of contract ambiguity from the law literature into the interorganizational governance literature. Within the context of franchising, the authors present a three-study multimethod design empirically establishing the construct of contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations, providing new insights into the strategic design of contracts and their outcomes. In Study 1, the authors establish construct validity by demonstrating that contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations is distinct from contract specificity and contract completeness of franchisor obligations, with differential outcomes. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors demonstrate that contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations increases an interest-based (vs. a rights-based) conflict solving approach, implying greater cooperation and joint problem solving, and reduces franchisee-initiated litigation. The findings also indicate that while contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations decreases franchisee-initiated litigation, this effect is amplified by higher levels of franchisor training programs but mitigated by the presence of a franchisee association. The article closes with a discussion of implications for academics and practitioners.",0
EXPRESS: Consumer Self-Control and the Biological Sciences: Implications for Marketing Stakeholders,Journal of Marketing,2020,"The authors argue that appreciation of the biological underpinnings of human behavior can alter the beliefs and actions of multiple marketing stakeholders in ways that have immense welfare implications. However, a biological perspective often deviates from the lay perspective. The realization of improved welfare depends in part on narrowing this gap. The authors review biological evidence on self-control and report 10 empirical studies that examine lay response to biological characterizations of self-control. The authors contrast lay response with scientific understanding and then offer implications of biology?as well as the gap between the scientific and lay perspectives?for policymakers, firms, consumers, marketing educators, and scholars. The authors also identify opportunities for future research. The authors conclude that marketing scholars can and should play an active role in narrowing the gap between the scientific and lay perspectives in the service of both theory development and human welfare.",0
Belief in Free Will: Implications for Practice and Policy,Journal of Marketing Research,2016,"The conviction one holds about free will serves as a foundation for the views one holds about the consumption activities of other consumers, the nature of social support systems, and the constraints that should or should not be placed on industry. Across multiple paradigms and contexts, the authors assess people's beliefs about the control consumers have over consumption activities in the face of various constraints on agency. They find that beliefs regarding personal discretion are robust and resilient, consistent with their finding that free will is viewed as noncorporeal. Nonetheless, they also find that these beliefs are not monolithic but vary as a function of identifiable differences across individuals and the perceived cause of behavior, particularly with regard to physical causation. Taken together, the results support the general wisdom of libertarian paternalism as a framework for public policy and highlight current and emerging situations in which policy makers might be granted greater latitude.",1
Do Firms Endowed with Greater Strategic Capability Earn Higher Profits?,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"Firms with different management teams evidence different strategic capabilities. Some are able to reason through the reactions of their competitors, whereas others are less sophisticated in their thinking. In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that the strategic firms will undercut their less sophisticated competitors? prices and earn greater profits. The authors show that, under certain conditions, the strategic firms charge higher prices and accrue smaller equilibrium profits than their nonstrategic counterparts. Strategic firms? efforts to capitalize on their loyal customers? higher willingness to pay increases nonstrategic firms? share of price-sensitive consumers. Furthermore, by raising prices, strategic firms help their nonstrategic counterparts more than themselves. This outcome arises when the proportion of consumers loyal to each firm is sufficiently large. A laboratory test for the main proposition's predictive accuracy provides empirical support.",1
Competition and Firm Service Reliability Decisions: A Study of the Airline Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"To understand the impact of competition on organizational service reliability decisions, this study investigates whether firms in the airline industry consider competitors? actions when making their service reliability decisions. Using data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics on flight cancellation rates and average length of flight delays, the authors use two complementary approaches, a simultaneous equation model and a discrete game framework, to examine competitive influence on firm decisions on the level of service reliability. The authors find that competitive effects are asymmetric and differ by the type of firm and its competitors?full-service versus low-cost airlines?as well by level of market concentration. The authors show that internal initiatives, such as on-time bonuses, can substantially improve service reliability but require the firm to account for competitive reactions. Ignoring competitive effects leads to an overestimation of the impact of these programs on service reliability levels.",1
The Effects of Strategic Orientations on Technology- and Market-Based Breakthrough Innovations,Journal of Marketing,2005,"Does market orientation impede breakthrough innovation? To date, researchers have presented opposing arguments with respect to this important issue. To address this controversy, the authors conceptualize and empirically test a model that links different types of strategic orientations and market forces, through organizational learning, to breakthrough innovations and firm performance. The results show that a market orientation facilitates innovations that use advanced technology and offer greater benefits to mainstream customers (i.e., technology-based innovations) but inhibits innovations that target emerging market segments (i.e., market-based innovations). A technology orientation is beneficial to technology-based innovations but has no impact on market-based innovations, and an entrepreneurial orientation facilitates both types of breakthroughs. Different market forces (demand uncertainty, technology turbulence, and competitive intensity) exert significant influence on technology- and market-based innovations, and these two types of innovations affect firm performance differently. The results have significant implications for firm strategies to facilitate product innovations and achieve competitive advantages.",0
Symbolic Value of Foreign Products in the People's Republic of China,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"In the People's Republic of China (PRC), consumers have recently shown a tendency to shift away from foreign products in preference for local offerings. Some commentators have speculated that this new market phenomenon is a result of government intervention, consumer ethnocentrism, and improvement in the quality of local products. In this study, the authors offer an alternative reason, which pertains to the fading symbolic value of foreign products in the PRC market. To provide support for their argument, Zhou and Hui present the results of a study of Chinese consumption behaviors involving a foreign, inconspicuous product item (Canadian pork sausage). By using such a privately consumed item, the authors attempt to demonstrate that symbolic benefits (such as modernity, prestige, and associations with foreign lifestyles) constitute one of the primary motivating forces of PRC consumers? purchases of products of nonlocal origin, including products that may not be commonly regarded as conspicuous. The results challenge the conventional wisdom that improvement in the quality of local products is the main cause of the decreasing competitiveness of foreign products in the PRC. The authors also discuss implications for global marketers with respect to market adaptation and positioning strategies in the PRC.",0
The Effects of Early Internationalization on Performance Outcomes in Young International Ventures: The Mediating Role of Marketing Capabilities,Journal of International Marketing,2012,"In an emerging market context, this article examines the impact of early international market entry on marketing capability development and performance outcomes in young and small entrepreneurial firms. The authors identify the importance of marketing capabilities and the boundary conditions associated with international commitment, as well as the type of international market entered (developed vs. emerging market), to determine performance outcomes in early internationalization. With survey data from more than 300 senior managers in China, the results indicate that early foreign market entry enhances a young venture's marketing capabilities, which in turn leads to international growth. The findings also reveal that young ventures tend to be in a better position to improve their marketing capabilities when their senior management demonstrates a high level of commitment to foreign markets. Furthermore, the impact of marketing capabilities on the performance outcomes of early internationalization seems more salient among ventures that target developed, rather than emerging, foreign markets. Theoretically, through the lens of organizational learning and the development of marketing capabilities, this article contributes to the study of international new ventures by demonstrating that marketing capabilities serve as enabling factors that help young international ventures mitigate their liabilities of foreignness to achieve international performance outcomes.",0
Contour-as-Face Framework: A Method to Preserve Privacy and Perception,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Consumers and marketers use facial information to make important inferences about others in many business contexts. However, consumers and firms are increasingly concerned about privacy and discrimination. To address privacy?perception trade-offs, the authors propose a novel contour-as-face (CaF) framework that transforms face images into contour images incorporating both the nonoutline and outline features of facial parts. In three empirical studies, the authors (1) compare human perceptions of face and contour images along 15 dimensions commonly assessed in marketing contexts; (2) investigate the effectiveness of contour images for protecting anonymity related to identity, age, and gender; and (3) implement the CaF framework in a real-life online dating context. Results show that the CaF framework effectively resolves privacy?perception trade-off problems by preserving the information that is useful for humans to make inferences about many relevant perceptual dimensions in marketing while making it virtually impossible for humans to infer identity and very difficult to infer age and gender accurately?two critical discrimination factors. Results from the field implementation demonstrate the feasibility and value of using the CaF framework for real-life decision making.",1
Impact of Online Consumer Reviews on Sales: The Moderating Role of Product and Consumer Characteristics,Journal of Marketing,2010,This article examines how product and consumer characteristics moderate the influence of online consumer reviews on product sales using data from the video game industry. The findings indicate that online reviews are more influential for less popular games and games whose players have greater Internet experience. The article shows differential impact of consumer reviews across products in the same product category and suggests that firms? online marketing strategies should be contingent on product and consumer characteristics. The authors discuss the implications of these results in light of the increased share of niche products in recent years.,0
The Double-Edged Sword of Signaling Effectiveness: When Salient Cues Curb Postpurchase Consumption,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"In juxtaposition to the common belief that marketing cues highlighting product effectiveness will generate positive influences on consumer demand, the authors argue that signaling effectiveness is a double-edged sword. While effectiveness cues may increase initial purchase, they can curb postpurchase consumption and potentially decrease long-term product sales. Four studies demonstrate that salient cues in advertising or packaging (e.g., pictures, brand names) can increase perceived product efficacy and lead to a lower usage amount on a single occasion. The authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's need for cognition. Furthermore, the authors find that promoting effectiveness with certain cues does not increase product choice yet reduces product usage. These results stress the importance of seeking salient cues that work to stimulate both choice and usage.",1
Scarcity Polarizes Preferences: The Impact on Choice among Multiple Items in a Product Class,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"This research examines how the salience of scarcity influences choices of individual items from a product class. The authors propose that overall perception of scarcity versus overall perception of abundance increases choice share of the most-preferred item from a product class. They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is mediated by consumers? reported arousal level and moderated by an experimentally induced arousal state.",1
Can Trade-Ins Hurt You? Exploring the Effect of a Trade-In on Consumers' Willingness to Pay for a New Product,Journal of Marketing Research,2008,"When consumers decide to upgrade to a new or better product, they often trade in their currently owned or used product for the new one. The authors examine whether such trade-in behavior, in which consumers must negotiate the price for both the new and the used product, affects their willingness-to-pay price for the new good. Drawing on research on mental accounting, the authors reason that when consumers engage in a transaction involving a trade-in (i.e., when they act as both buyer and seller simultaneously), they place more importance on getting a good value for the used product than on getting a good price for the new product. As a result, such consumers exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay price for the new product than consumers who just buy the new product alone. The results from a series of laboratory experiments provide systematic support for this hypothesis. Finally, the authors lend external validity to their results by confirming the hypothesis using real-world transaction data from the automobile market.",1
Does Online Community Participation Foster Risky Financial Behavior?,Journal of Marketing Research,2012,"Although consumers increasingly use online communities for various activities, little is known about how participation in them affects people's decision-making strategies. Through a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that participation in an online community increases people's risk-seeking tendencies in their financial decisions and behaviors. The results reveal that participation in an online community leads consumers to believe that they will receive help or support from other members should difficulties arise. Such a perception leads online community participants to make riskier financial decisions than nonparticipants. The authors also discover a boundary condition to the effect: Online community members are more risk seeking only when they have relatively strong ties with other members; when ties are weak, they exhibit similar risk preferences as nonmembers.",1
Distinguishing between the Meanings of Music: When Background Music Affects Product Perceptions,Journal of Marketing Research,2005,"Music theory distinguishes between two types of meanings that music can impart: (1) embodied meaning, which is purely hedonic, context independent, and based on the degree of stimulation the musical sound affords, and (2) referential meaning, which is context dependent and reflects networks of semantic-laden, external world concepts. Two studies investigate which (if either) of these background music meanings influence perceptions of an advertised product and when. Findings suggest that people who engage in nonintensive processing are insensitive to either type of meaning. However, more intensive processors base their perceptions on the music's referential meaning when ad message processing requires few resources, but they use the music's embodied meaning when such processing is relatively resource demanding.",1
The Influence of Self-View on Context Effects: How Display Fixtures Can Affect Product Evaluations,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"Can the surface material of a display table prompt context effects on shoppers? product evaluations? If so, how might the direction of such effects be influenced by people's use of different modes of cognition?namely, holistic versus analytic cognition? The authors theorize and find that people's use of holistic cognition, as prompted by an interdependent self-view, produces an assimilation effect. Product evaluations are assimilated with associations with the table surface. However, people who rely on analytic processing, as prompted by an independent self-view, elicit a contrast effect in which evaluations are negatively related to such associations.",1
Market Structure and Competition in the Retail Discount Industry,Journal of Marketing Research,2009,"This article examines competition among Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target using two distinct but related approaches. The authors first develop and estimate a discrete game in which each chain's store presence and format decisions in local markets depend on the decisions of its competitors and market characteristics. This analysis is extended to evaluate the determinants of store revenues for each chain in local markets as a function of market characteristics, including the presence of competing firms. These regressions use the results of the initial model to correct for the endogeneity of observed market structures. The results from both exercises illustrate several important asymmetries across the firms. Kmart and Wal-Mart prefer similar markets, but Wal-Mart's competitive position is dominant enough to prevent Kmart's operation in otherwise attractive markets. In contrast, Target prefers substantially different market characteristics. In total, the results support a view of the industry as one in which Wal-Mart is dominant, Target serves more of a niche role, and Kmart struggles to find its footing.",1
Selective Reporting of Factual Content by Commercial Media,Journal of Marketing Research,2015,"The authors study the market for factual content and examine whether competition increases or decreases its provision. Factual content is supplied by commercial media firms, which observe a set of facts depicting the state of the world and selectively decide how to report them. Consumers value content that matches their opinion, which incentivizes media firms to slant their reports by omitting certain facts. Novel features in the authors? model include consumers? ability to anticipate the media's incentives for slant and the requirement that all media stances must be supported by facts. Furthermore, consumers find reports with more facts to be more convincing. Despite consumers? ability to detect slant and their demand for factual support, the research shows that competition results in consumers reading fewer facts and being unable to update their prior beliefs about the state of the world. The authors also find that a monopoly medium may be more polarizing than competitive media and that polarized reporting can be less biased.",1
Innovations in Product Functionality: When and Why Are Explicit Comparisons Effective?,Journal of Marketing,2003,"The authors investigate the effects of explicit comparisons in differentiating innovations that offer new functionalities to the consumer. Although marketing communications commonly employ explicit comparisons in launching new product functionalities, the authors suggest that such comparisons are not always helpful. The authors show that an explicit comparison of a new functionality with an existing functionality is effective only when the new functionality is offered in a device or physical product that is atypical of the existing functionality. However, when the new functionality is offered in a product that is typical of the existing functionality, explicit comparisons tend to backfire because they merely facilitate the assimilation of the new functionality to the prior functionality. The results of three studies provide significant support for the predictions, and a fourth study demonstrates how the backfire effect might be avoided. The authors discuss implications for communication tactics, new product marketing, and consumer behavior theory.",0
Sizing up the Effect of Portion Size on Consumption: A Meta-Analytic Review,Journal of Marketing,2014,"Food marketing is facing increasing challenges in using portion size (e.g., ?supersizing?) as a marketing tool. Marketers have used portion size to attract customers and encourage purchase, but social agencies are expressing concern that larger portion sizes encourage greater consumption, which can cause excessive consumption and obesity. This article addresses two questions that are central to this debate: (1) How much effect does portion size have on consumption? and (2) Are there limits to this effect? A meta-analytic review reveals that, for a doubling of portion size, consumption increases by 35% on average. However, the effect has limits. An extended analysis shows that the effect of portion size is curvilinear: as portions become increasingly larger, the effect diminishes. In addition, although the portion-size effect is widespread and robust across a range of individual and environmental factors, the analysis shows that it is weaker among children, women, and overweight individuals, as well as for nonsnack food items and in contexts in which more attention is given to the food being eaten.",0
The GMS: A Broad Conceptualization of Global Marketing Strategy and Its Effect on Firm Performance,Journal of Marketing,2002,"Despite the strong interest in global marketing, there is no consensus in the literature about what constitutes a global marketing strategy and whether it affects a firm's global market performance. The authors develop a broad conceptualization of global marketing strategy, the GMS, that integrates three major perspectives?namely, the standardization, configuration?coordination, and integration perspectives?of global marketing strategy. They also develop a conceptual model that links the GMS to a firm's global market performance. On the basis of a survey of business units competing in global industries, the authors find support for the broad GMS perspective and the fundamental relationship between the GMS and firms' global market performance. The authors also discuss theoretical and managerial implications of their findings.",0
The Effect of Export Marketing Capabilities on Export Performance: An Investigation of Chinese Exporters,Journal of International Marketing,2003,"The primary purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of export marketing capabilities on export performance. Drawing on the resource-based view, the authors develop a model that links an exporter's product development capability, distribution capability, communication capability, and pricing capability with its positional advantages (low-cost advantage and branding advantage) and its performance in the export market. On the basis of a survey of Chinese export ventures, the authors find general support for their proposed model. The authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings.",0
Global Product R&D and the Firm's Strategic Position,Journal of International Marketing,1999,"The authors investigate coordination and concentration of firms? global product research and development (R&D) and their effect on the firm's global strategic position. Some internal and external antecedents of coordination and concentration also are identified. A conceptual model is developed and tested by structural equation modeling. The results show that coordination of R&D is a key determinant of the firm's global strategic position. Furthermore, coordination of R&D is influenced by global emphasis and human resource flexibility, both internal organizational resources. Similarly, concentration of R&D is influenced by human resource flexibility. The implications of the findings are discussed.",0
The EXPERF Scale: A Cross-National Generalized Export Performance Measure,Journal of International Marketing,1998,"A large number of studies have attempted to identify factors that are correlated with exporting success. However, much controversy exists about the key determinants of export performance and their relative importance. A major reason for this lack of consensus is the absence of a unified measure for capturing export performance. In this study, an attempt is made to develop a generalized export performance measure, the EXPERF scale, that can be applied to multiple countries. Results from a survey of top executives of U.S. and Japanese exporters support a three-dimensional scale for measuring export performance. The three dimensions of the export performance (EXPERF) scale are financial export performance, strategic export performance, and satisfaction with export venture. Implications of the study for further research and managerial practice are also discussed.",0
Integration of Primary and Resale Platforms,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Consumers can buy concert tickets from primary platforms (e.g., Ticketmaster) or from consumer-to-consumer resale platforms (e.g., StubHub). Recently, Ticketmaster has entered and been trying to control the resale market by prohibiting consumers from reselling on competing resale platforms. Several states in the United States have passed or are discussing laws requiring tickets to be transferrable on any resale sites, worrying that platform integration?Ticketmaster controlling both the primary and the resale platforms?will increase ticket service fees and harm musicians and consumers. This article establishes a game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen: platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets, alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting the musician and consumers. Moreover, with platform integration, the presence of a small number of scalpers can counterintuitively reduce the ticket price and benefit the musicians and consumers. In addition, platform competition in the resale market may harm consumers. This article further shows that these insights apply in other markets (e.g. used goods, peer-to-peer product-sharing markets) and provides suggestive empirical support for the theoretical results.",1
Predicting Mobile Advertising Response Using Consumer Colocation Networks,Journal of Marketing,2017,"Building on results from economics and consumer behavior, the authors theorize that consumers? movement patterns are informative of their product preferences, and this study proposes that marketers monetize this information using dynamic networks that capture colocation events (when consumers appear at the same place at approximately the same time). To support this theory, the authors study mobile advertising response in a panel of 217 subscribers. The data set spans three months during which participants were sent mobile coupons from retailers in various product categories through a smartphone application. The data contain coupon conversions, demographic and psychographic information, and information on the hourly GPS location of participants and on their social ties in the form of referrals. The authors find a significant positive relationship between colocated consumers? response to coupons in the same product category. In addition, they show that incorporating consumers? location information can increase the accuracy of predicting the most likely conversions by 19%. These findings have important practical implications for marketers engaging in the fast-growing location-based mobile advertising industry.",0
Service Providers? Decision to Use Ethics Committees and Consultation in Complex Services,Journal of Marketing Research,2020,"Ethics has long been, and continues to be, a central topic among marketing scholars and practitioners. When providing complex services?multiple interactions over time that are predicated on the evolving needs of customers?service providers face ethical dilemmas, which are often resolved by engaging an ethics committee (EC). Despite the prevalence of ECs, research on service providers? preference to engage with an EC is sparse. This study examines whether the role that health care providers play, as either task manager or relationship manager, makes a difference in their preference for engaging with and utilizing an EC for resolving ethical dilemmas. Results based on 1,440 observations collected from health care service providers show that service providers? task or relationship management role, as well as prior experience with an ethics consultation, influences their preference both for engaging an EC and for having the EC prescribe a specific outcome to resolve an ethical dilemma. This study extends prior work on conceptual models examining ethical decision-making processes in marketing.",1
